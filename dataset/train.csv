I'm just saying that Entresto has been a major failure of Novartis commercial organisation. They (Novartis) were totally exposed at Q1 call. With reimbursement issues being resolved, the true underlying problem with Entresto was unveiled: Novartis failed to create the demand for the drug. Their disease-awareness campaign in the US (the drowning man) was incredibly poor (fear- and panic-inducing). What is more, they advertised the wrong condition. They were raising awareness of life-threatening ACUTE heart failure instead of CHRONIC heart failure, for which Entresto is indicated. Entresto has nothing to do with the treatment of acute heart failure. If that was not due to their shocking lack of knowledge of the disease area, it can only be explained as a conscious misleading of patients. They managed to alienate medical community, advocacy groups and top KOLs, including their own principal investigator in Entresto trials who publicly expressed his concerns. It?s unheard of. But it provides clues as to what actually happened. An incompetent strategic marketing team establishes the wrong go-to-market model based on wrong market assumptions. And they persistently kept going in the wrong direction, completely oblivious to the extent of their own incompetence. It's a typical example of ignorance bias (""Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge?). If it wasn?t for the analysts who were challenging Novartis in public, who knows how long they would have continued to be in denial. It is stunning that Novartis, once a leading cardiovascular company, bombed the launch of a cardiovascular primary care product - a combo of their own Diovan. With this, they discovered a new low. David was let down by his own people. He trusted them, but he should have known better. His hands-off management style didn?t work at Novartis Pharma (in contrast to Oncology). It?s a toxic culture, populated with yes people, where competences and skills are not valued or required for promotion. It is strange though that after so many years in operational positions, Joerg seemingly stayed uninvolved. At least that's how it looks from the outside.",0

The Emmy and Grammy winner has joined forces with the American Heart Association for its Red Steps campaign. The idea is for people to post photos of themselves taking steps while wearing red socks, to become more physically active and raise awareness of the risks and symptoms of heart failure. The goal is six million ?red steps,? in recognition of the nearly six million Americans living with heart failure For Latifah, born Dana Owens, the effort is personal. Her mother, Rita Owens, suffers from scleroderma, an incurable autoimmune disease that has caused scar tissue build up in her lungs. The 66-year-old former schoolteacher also has pulmonary hypertension, which impacts her ability to breathe. ?It's just a way for us to show support for all of those people who are dealing with the condition and those who care for them,? Latifah told ABC Radio. Latifah said her mother?s approval of the campaign was imperative to her getting involved. ?I really wanted her to be involved and I wanted her permission,? Latifah confided. ?She's just so eloquent and positive in the way she puts things, it's something that we as a family like to share with other people because realize that by her talking about some of her medical issues, a lot of people are reaching out and saying 'Me too.'? The rapper turned actress says the campaign has also helped her get healthy. ?I am not perfect when it comes to just staying fit constantly all the time,? she shared, saying the campaign reminds her to be diligent and that she doesn?t have to do it alone. But most of all it?s about helping other. ?Sometimes I can rally that support and I can do right in my own group of family and friends,? she says. Copyright ? 2016, ABC Radio.

I have thrown up blood twice in the matter of 2 weeks. My parents don't want to take me to see a doctor as they think that the doctor will only give me pain killers, whereas I have no pain. I really don't know what to, I eat normally but I can also go on not eating for a whole day and not feel hungry. I weigh 92.6 pounds and I am 5 feet and 2 inches tall. I don't know what to do and I thought I could stop this onmy own but now, I can't. Please help me get this over? ANSWER: Good for you- noticing this is a problem you can't face on your own. Your parents need to learn a little more about bulimia and you can feel free to share this. Bulimia is NOT about the food - it's a psychological disorder. No pain killers are involved in treating psychological disorders, however, some prescriptions may be suggested to get certain levels back in order while counseling works together with the prescriptions to conquer the illness. These drug therapies do not alter consciousness or anything else - they just assist in getting back in balance. Bulimia is a very serious disorder and can result in a fatality without warning. In the case described here, there's a very high chance of esophageal rupture. The victim dies by drowning in their own bodily fluids, often within minutes. Electrolyte imbalances can cause heart failure. A very famous case of a woman in a coma for over a decade resulted from heart failure due to her bulimia. Can you imagine? More than ten years in a coma? Because stomach acids are wearing away areas of the esophagus that it shouldn't - the instances of cancer are increased greatly for many years, even after bulimia stops. Throat and mouth cancers are also increased. Losing a life to cancer, or losing a voice box, part of your face, mouth - hardly worth delaying getting medical help right away. Bulimia also increases the chances of stomach and intestinal cancers, lifelong stomach problems, tooth decay/disease and loss and so much more there's no room here. If your parents refuse to take your life seriously and value it, it's up to you. Fight for yourself. Ask a school counselor, clergy, or seek a free clinic on your own.

The extract makes a brief aside about the need to pee! ""In the standing position, the lungs can be roughly divided into three zones: 1) where there is ventilation but no perfusion (the top of the lungs. There is no blood flow because the pressure head out of the right heart is not high enough to pump blood that high); 2) where there is ventilation and perfusion (the middle part of the lungs; and 3) where there is perfusion but no ventilation (the bottoms of the lungs where the fluid pressure is higher than the opening pressure of the bronchioles and alveoli where gas exchange takes place). All this is dependent on gravity and fluid pressures--basic physics. The volume of the air in the airways that doesn't participate in gas exchange combined with the volume of air in zone 1 is called the dead space, and amounts to about 1/3 of your normal breath. When you assume a supine or recumbent position, things change. Zone 1 gets a lot smaller, but zone 3 gets bigger, and there is a large individual variation. Secondly. the volume of blood that resides in the lower extremities when upright gets pushed back into the system when you are supine, and the pulmonary circulation, since it is a high volume-low pressure system ends up being the receptacle for much of it. That is why people in heart failure like to sleep sitting up--they can breathe much better. Lung function is the same, but respiratory function has changed. That is also one of the reasons why people riding recumbents tend to have to pee more after riding for a while--stretch receptors in the vessels signal the fluid load to the body which in turn signals the kidneys to make more urine.""",0

BLOG,http://quranfruitz.blogspot.com,http://quranfruitz.blogspot.com/2016/02/causes-of-low-blood-pressurehypo-tension.html,2/28/2016,3:20:00,2/28/2016 13:50,Causes of Low Blood Pressure(Hypo tension),"Blood pressure is a measurement of the pressure in your arteries during the active and resting phases of each heartbeat. Here?s what the numbers mean: Systolic pressure. The first (top) number in a blood pressure reading, this is the amount of pressure your heart generates when pumping blood through your arteries to the rest of your body. Diastolic pressure. The second (bottom) number in a blood pressure reading, this refers to the amount of pressure in your arteries when your heart is at rest between beats. Current guidelines identify normal blood pressure as lower than 120/80 mm Hg. Although you can get an accurate blood pressure reading at any given time, blood pressure isn?t always the same. It can vary considerably in a short amount of time ? sometimes from one heartbeat to the next, depending on body position, breathing rhythm, stress level, physical condition, medications you take, what you eat and drink, and even time of day. Blood pressure is usually lowest at night and rises sharply on waking. BLOOD PRESSURE: HOW LOW CAN YOU GO? What?s considered low blood pressure for you may be normal for someone else. Most doctors consider chronically low blood pressure too low only if it causes noticeable symptoms. Some experts define low blood pressure as readings lower than 90 mm Hg systolic or 60 mm Hg diastolic ? you need to have only one number in the low range for your blood pressure to be considered lower than normal. In other words, if your systolic pressure is a perfect 115, but your diastolic pressure is 50, you?re considered to have lower than normal pressure. A sudden fall in blood pressure also can be dangerous. A change of just 20 mm Hg ? a drop from 110 systolic to 90 mm Hg systolic, for example ? can cause dizziness and fainting when the brain fails to receive an adequate supply of blood. And big plunges, especially those caused by uncontrolled bleeding, severe infections or allergic reactions, can be life-threatening. Athletes and people who exercise regularly tend to have lower blood pressure and a slower heart rate than do people who aren?t as fit. So, in general, do nonsmokers and people who eat a healthy diet and maintain a normal weight. But in some rare instances, low blood pressure can be a sign of serious, even life-threatening disorders. CONDITIONS THAT CAN CAUSE LOW BLOOD PRESSURE Some medical conditions can cause low blood pressure. These include: Pregnancy. Because a woman?s circulatory system expands rapidly during pregnancy, blood pressure is likely to drop. This is normal, and blood pressure usually returns to your pre-pregnancy level after you?ve given birth. Heart problems. Some heart conditions that can lead to low blood pressure include extremely low heart rate (bradycardia), heart valve problems, heart attack and heart failure.These conditions may cause low blood pressure because they prevent your body from being able to circulate enough blood. Endocrine problems. Thyroid conditions ? such as parathyroid disease ? adrenal insufficiency (Addison?s disease), low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and, in some cases, diabetes can trigger low blood pressure. Dehydration. When you become dehydrated, your body loses more water than it takes in. Even mild dehydration can cause weakness, dizziness and fatigue. Fever, vomiting, severe diarrhea, overuse of diuretics and strenuous exercise can all lead to dehydration.Far more serious is hypovolemic shock, a life-threatening complication of dehydration. It occurs when low blood volume causes a sudden drop in blood pressure and a reduction in the amount of oxygen reaching your tissues. If untreated, severe hypovolemic shock can cause death within a few minutes or hours. Blood loss. Losing a lot of blood from a major injury or internal bleeding reduces the amount of blood in your body, leading to a severe drop in blood pressure. Severe infection (septicemia). Septicemia can happen when an infection in the body enters the bloodstream. This condition can lead to a life-threatening drop in blood pressure called septic shock. Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. Common triggers of anaphylaxis include foods, certain medications, insect venoms and latex. Anaphylaxis can cause breathing problems, hives, itching, a swollen throat and a drop in blood pressure. Lack of nutrients in your diet. A lack of the vitamins B-12 and folate can cause a condition in which your body doesn?t produce enough red blood cells (anemia), causing low blood pressure. MEDICATIONS THAT CAN CAUSE LOW BLOOD PRESSURE Some medications you may take can also cause low blood pressure, including: Diuretics (water pills), such as furosemide (Lasix) and hydrochlorothiazide (Microzide, Oretic) Alpha blockers, such as prazosin (Minipress) and labetalol Beta blockers, such as atenolol (Tenormin), propranolol (Inderal, Innopran XL, others) and timolol Drugs for Parkinson?s disease, such as pramipexole (Mirapex) or those containing levodopa Certain types of antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants), including doxepin (Silenor), imipramine (Tofranil), protriptyline (Vivactil) and trimipramine (Surmontil) Sildenafil (Viagra) or tadalafil (Cialis), particularly in combination with the heart medication nitroglycerin TYPES OF LOW BLOOD PRESSURE Doctors often break down low blood pressure (hypotension) into different categories, depending on the causes and other factors. Some types of low blood pressure include: Low blood pressure on standing up (orthostatic, or postural, hypotension). This is a sudden drop in blood pressure when you stand up from a sitting position or if you stand up after lying down.Ordinarily, gravity causes blood to pool in your legs whenever you stand. Your body compensates for this by increasing your heart rate and constricting blood vessels, thereby ensuring that enough blood returns to your brain.But in people with orthostatic hypotension, this compensating mechanism fails and blood pressure falls, leading to symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision and even fainting. Orthostatic hypotension can occur for a variety of reasons, including dehydration, prolonged bed rest, pregnancy, diabetes, heart problems, burns, excessive heat, large varicose veins and certain neurological disorders. A number of medications also can cause orthostatic hypotension, particularly drugs used to treat high blood pressure ? diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors ? as well as antidepressants and drugs used to treat Parkinson?s disease and erectile dysfunction. Orthostatic hypotension is especially common in older adults, with as many as 20 percent of those older than age 65 experiencing orthostatic hypotension. But orthostatic hypotension can also affect young, otherwise healthy people who stand up suddenly after sitting with their legs crossed for long periods or after working for a time in a squatting position. Low blood pressure after eating (postprandial hypotension). Postprandial hypotension is a sudden drop in blood pressure after eating. It affects mostly older adults.Just as gravity pulls blood to your feet when you stand, a large amount of blood flows to your digestive tract after you eat.Ordinarily, your body counteracts this by increasing your heart rate and constricting certain blood vessels to help maintain normal blood pressure. But in some people these mechanisms fail, leading to dizziness, faintness and falls. Postprandial hypotension is more likely to affect people with high blood pressure or autonomic nervous system disorders such as Parkinson?s disease. Lowering the dose of blood pressure drugs and eating small, low-carbohydrate meals may help reduce symptoms. Low blood pressure from faulty brain signals (neurally mediated hypotension). This disorder causes blood pressure to drop after standing for long periods, leading to signs and symptoms such as dizziness, nausea and fainting.Neurally mediated hypotension mostly affects young people, and it seems to occur because of a miscommunication between the heart and the brain.When you stand for extended periods, your blood pressure falls as blood pools in your legs. Normally, your body then makes adjustments to normalize your blood pressure. But in people with neurally mediated hypotension, nerves in the heart?s left ventricle actually signal the brain that blood pressure is too high, rather than too low. As a result, the brain lessens the heart rate, decreasing blood pressure even further. This causes more blood to pool in the legs and less blood to reach the brain, leading to lightheadedness and fainting. Low blood pressure due to nervous system damage (multiple system atrophy with orthostatic hypotension).Also called Shy-Drager syndrome, this rare disorder causes progressive damage to the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, breathing and digestion.Although this condition can be associated with muscle tremors, slowed movement, problems with coordination and speech, and incontinence, its main characteristic is severe orthostatic hypotension in combination with very high blood pressure when lying down. Low Blood Pressure Causes General: Hypotension (low blood pressure) without symptoms is not generally a cause for concern. Long-term hypotension that does not cause symptoms is rarely serious. In fact, many athletes have low blood pressure and have a decreased risk of developing heart disease. Hypotension that causes symptoms may be a sign of an underlying health condition. Sometimes, hypotension may even indicate a serious and/or life-threatening problem, such as a widespread infection. Below are some of the most common causes of hypotension. Allergic reaction (anaphylaxis): A life-threatening allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis, often causes a sudden and dramatic drop in blood pressure. Additional symptoms may include itching, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the throat and tongue, stomach cramps, nausea, and diarrhea. This reaction may occur in response to medications, herbs, supplements, foods (such as peanuts), bee stings, or other severe allergies. Blood loss: Sudden hypotension may occur if a person loses a lot of blood from a serious injury, internal bleeding, or complications during surgery. The severity of hypotension depends on how much blood is lost. Endocrine problems: Endocrine disorders, also called hormonal disorders, may cause hypotension. Endocrine problems occur when the body releases too many or too few hormones, which are chemicals that help regulate bodily functions. Endocrine problems, such as an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease), low blood sugar levels, and in some cases, diabetes, may lead to hypotension. Dehydration: Dehydration may lead to hypotension. Even mild dehydration may cause symptoms, such as lightheadedness, dizziness, and weakness. Severe dehydration may lead to a life-threatening complication, called hypovolemic shock. This condition occurs when a decreased blood volume in the body causes a sudden drop in blood pressure. As a result, the body's tissues and organs do not receive enough oxygen. If left untreated, hypoyolemic shock may be fatal within a few minutes to hours. Heart problems: Several heart problems, including an extremely low heart rate (called bradycardia), heart valve problems, heart attack, and heart failure, may lead to hypotension. These conditions prevent the body from circulating enough blood to tissues and organs. Medications: Many drugs can cause low blood pressure, including diuretics, blood pressure-lowering drugs, heart medications (such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers), drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, tricyclic antidepressants, erectile dysfunction drugs (such as Viagra?), narcotics, and alcohol. Other medications (prescription and over-the-counter) may lower blood pressure when they are taken in combination with blood pressure-lowering drugs. Nutritional deficiencies: People who have low levels of vitamin B-12 and folate may develop anemia, a condition that may cause low blood pressure. People who have eating disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia, have an increased risk of developing nutritional deficiencies that can lead to hypotension. Pregnancy: A woman's blood pressure often decreases during pregnancy. This is because the mother's circulatory system expands quickly during pregnancy. During the first 24 weeks of pregnancy it is common for a woman's systolic blood pressure to drop five to 10 points and for her diastolic pressure to drop 10-15 points. Septicemia and septic shock: A severe infection, called septicemia, may lead to hypotension. Septicemia occurs when an infection enters the bloodstream and spreads throughout the body. As the heart works extra hard to pump blood throughout the body, it starts to weaken and blood pressure drops. When blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels, the condition is called septic shock.",0

LS out of Richmond. Ugh! What a self centered, I like to hear myself speak on conference calls, egotistical narcissistic bitch. It is hard to believe she is a nurse. Doesn't have one single nursing quality. After reading this article, however, the area managers are just a reflection of what comes from the top down. Get a clue Novartis.... Karma will get you and it is already salivating at your ankles. Clouds gather over Novartis as it battles series of setbacks Andrew Ward in London and Ralph Atkins in Zurich Joe Jimenez is facing a battle to restore investor confidence in Novartis after a series of setbacks which have sent shares in the Swiss pharmaceuticals group down more than a quarter in the past year. Disappointing sales of a new heart drug have combined with problems in the group?s Alcon eyecare business to create arguably the rockiest period for Mr Jimenez since the American took charge six years ago. Legal risks have added to the gloom as Novartis faces investigation for suspected marketing abuses in the US, South Korea and Turkey on top of recent cases in Japan and China. All these problems have been brewing for months but the heat has turned up in the past few weeks as a succession of analysts cut growth forecasts for the group. Mr Jimenez still has credit with investors for asweeping overhaul in which Novartis has narrowed the sprawling range of businesses built by his predecessor, Daniel Vasella. He is likely to trumpet progress towards cutting costs and restructuring Alcon when the group announces first-quarter results on Thursday. However, the headline numbers are unlikely to part the clouds hanging over Novartis. Analysts expect sales and profits to be down as the eyecare business continues to drag on performance. The mood was much different a year ago when the group was preparing to launch Entresto, a much-anticipated treatment for heart failure. Data showing that the drug cut deaths by a fifth in clinical trials fuelled confidence that it would be the new blockbuster Novartis desperately needed to offset the looming loss of patent protection on its best-selling Gleevec cancer drug. Yet, instead of the expected gush, sales of Entresto started at a trickle. The $5m registered in the final quarter of 2015 was less than a tenth of analysts? forecast. They have described the launch as ?glacial? and a ?huge disappointment?. Novartis declined to comment, citing the quiet period ahead of its results. But analysts sympathetic to the group point out that Mr Jimenez was always clear that it would take time for Entresto to gain momentum. There has, so far, been no retreat from his long-term target for peak annual sales of $5bn from the drug. Others are no longer as confident. Citigroup last month slashed its Entresto sales forecast from $10bn in 2025 to just $2bn. The worry for investors is that Entresto?s weak start may be a harbinger of tougher times ahead in the US. Two much-hyped cholesterol-lowering drugs from Sanofi andAmgen have also been stuck in the slow lane since their launch last year. This has added to evidence that US insurers and healthcare providers are becoming more aggressive in their bargaining with big pharma as structural changes in the health system increase incentives for cost savings. Without a strong contribution from Entresto this year, Novartis has been left badly exposed to a decline at Alcon ? a business acquired from Nestl? for $50bn in a two-part transaction completed in 2010. Mr Jimenez announced a change of leadershipat the unit in January and narrowed its focus to contact lenses and surgical equipment, while its eye drugs were transferred to the main pharma division. A target was set for Alcon to return to growth by the end of the year and Mr Jimenez insisted that eyecare remained an attractive market given rising demand from an ageing world population. However, Seamus Fernandez, analyst at Leerink, says the business may be sold if the turnround falters. Further uncertainty comes from the series of investigations facing Novartis over suspected marketing abuses in the US, Turkey and South Korea. That is on top of a $25m settlement paid to the US Securities and Exchange Commission last month for bribery in China and a suspension of its business in Japan last year as punishment for manipulating clinical trial data. By far the biggest peril is from a lawsuit being pursued by Preet Bharara, the formidable US attorney-general for the southern district of New York. He has accused Novartis of funnelling kickbacks to prescribers through as many as 80,0000 ?sham? educational meetings where doctors were wined and dined. Mr Bharara, has already secured a $390m settlement from Novartis in a separate case last year, and Andrew Baum, analyst at Citigroup, says there is a ?high probability? of another fine that could be similar in scale to the record $3bn paid byGlaxoSmithKline to the US justice department in 2012. Like GSK, Novartis might also have to commit to marketing reforms that would make it harder to aggressively push Entresto. Mr Baum said this could ?severely impact? earnings and cast ?a reputational shadow over the incumbent Novartis chairman [Joerg Reinhardt] and CEO?. In an attempt to clean up, Novartis has appointed a chief ethics officer and is in the process of tightening its rules on relations with doctors. For all the challenges, some analysts still see reasons for optimism. While Entresto has flopped so far, another new product, Cosentyx for psoriasis, has started strongly with forecasts of $2.5bn in annual sales by 2020. Michael Nawrath, analyst at ZÅrcher Kantonalbank, says Mr Jimenez could refresh the business with bolt-on deals. ?It doesn?t have to be a mega merger, but there are smart asset swaps, collaborations, or purchases?.?.?.?which could convince shareholders that there is future growth.?",0

Cutting down on one ingredient according to their guidelines (something almost nobody questions) will lead to stroke, heart attack and death, even if you succeed in lowering your blood pressure. Many organizations, including the US Food and Drug Administration and the American Heart Association, have warned that a high sodium intake causes high blood pressure. Accordingly, the official dietary guidelines set by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture state that people should eat no more than 2,300 milligrams (or 2.3 grams) of sodium per day, and that they should keep it well below this if possible. Many researchers have now started questioning this recommendation. The largest recent study of this kind was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The scientists collected the information of more than 100,000 people?s daily sodium consumption throughout the world by looking at the amount of sodium excreted in their urine. They also collected those same people?s blood pressure readings. Their findings: 1. A large majority of those people who consumed 5.99 or more grams of sodium per day had high blood pressure. From this, they concluded that such a massive sodium intake clearly caused high blood pressure. 2. As only a moderate number of people with a daily sodium intake between 3 and 5.99 grams suffered from high blood pressure, they concluded that the relationship between sodium intake and blood pressure was weaker for this group, but that there was still a relationship. 3. For the low intake group below three grams per day, they found no relationship between sodium and blood pressure. Instead of falling, as the popular theory would suggest, these people?s blood pressure scores were completely random. This shows that low sodium diets do not lower blood pressure. This was, however, not the study?s most interesting finding. After following the participants for an average of 3.7 years, they discovered this: 1. 4.3% of those who consumed less than three grams of daily sodium either died, developed heart failure, or suffered a heart attack or stroke. 2. 3.1% with an intake between three and six grams experienced these outcomes. 3. 3.2% with an intake between six and seven grams did. 4. 3.3% with an intake above seven grams did. That is, those with the lowest sodium consumption, consistent with governmental guidelines, were the most likely to die and suffer harmful cardiovascular events. Perhaps this should not be surprising. Sodium is an essential mineral. Sodium is critical for all of this:? Maintains normal blood pressure and blood volume? Generates nerve impulses for normal nerve function? Contributes to muscle contractions? Helps to balance electrolytes? Plays a part in the metabolic processes that supply you with energy? Ensures that your body maintains a good balance between retaining necessary water and dumping surplus water. Another interesting finding was that people with a high sodium intake were less likely to have high blood pressure if they also consumed plenty of potassium. Repeated studies have in fact proven that loading up on food-based potassium is more important than cutting out salt. So stock up on dark leafy greens, white beans, salmon, squash, avocados, and bananas, and then you can add your healthy Himalayan pink salt to your food if you like. Regardless of how much salt you consume; if your blood pressure is high, you must take actions to lower it. 22",0

According to the report, the global blood pressure monitoring devices market was valued at US$ 2.0 Bn in 2014 and is estimated to reach US$ 3.8 Bn by 2023 at a CAGR of 7.3% from 2015 to 2023. Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a long-term medical condition, wherein blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms. Long-term high blood pressure; however, is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Factors such as rising obese population, growing incidence of heart diseases, chronic conditions, and diabetes, and increasing hypertensive patients have accelerated demand for blood pressure monitoring devices globally. Measurement of blood pressure on a regular basis is important for monitoring various clinical conditions, which when not monitored regularly could lead to renal failure, heart failure, or stroke. The trend of regular monitoring is fast catching up, with patients opting for automated self-care. Currently, majority of the automated blood pressure monitoring devices available are based on oscillometric method that provides accurate results. The number of people diagnosed with high blood pressure is increasing globally. Hypertension remains non-symptomatic unless diagnosed accidently; hence, many patients remain undiagnosed. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 50% of the total patient population is unaware about the fact that they suffer from hypertension and in some population, awareness is very low, less than 10%. Hence, the WHO has introduced initiatives such as the World Hypertension Day, which aims to increase awareness about hypertension globally. The automated blood pressure monitors held the largest share of the global blood pressure monitoring devices market in 2014. Major factors driving the automated blood pressure monitors segment include portability, easy to use interface, and multiple display functions such as blood pressure levels and pulse rate that are easy to read. Automated blood pressure monitors also have the feature to store the last measurement of up to 10 readings. With rising preference for home-based monitoring devices, manufacturers are coming up with high-end blood pressure devices that have low cost, show quick and accurate results, and that measure, monitor, store, and notify blood pressure readings to patients as well as health care professionals. Moreover, with rising implementation and acceptance of eHealth and mHealth globally, health care professionals are able to monitor and track the health of patients more efficiently and rapidly. Thus, the automated blood pressure monitors segment is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of 9.0% during the forecast period. Request A Sample Of This Report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=1630 Home blood pressure monitoring devices was the largest end-user segment of the market in terms of revenue in 2014. The segment is projected to dominate the market during the forecast period. Increasing trend of home health care and rising demand for home-based blood pressure monitors have augmented market growth. Moreover, advancement in technologies is also considered a potential driver of the segment. Several leading companies are striving to introduce innovative and novel blood pressure monitors that can be used in home setting. For instance, in November 2012, OMRON Healthcare introduced HEM-7251G digital blood pressure monitor along with Medical LINK system that transmits blood pressure measurement data automatically through a network. Incorporation of new and advanced technologies by key players would attract new customers, which in turn is likely to drive the home blood pressure monitors market. The kiosk end-user segment is anticipated to expand at the highest CAGR of 10.3% owing to the increasing trend of blood pressure monitoring at kiosks in developed regions such as North America and Europe.",0

This week George Osborne dropped the UK?s federal budget. It?s got some interesting points. And one headline (and vote) grabbing new measure. If the UK budget is anything to go by ? and it is ? then the Aussie Budget in a couple of months? time could be just as big. Whatever happens in the upcoming Aussie Budget, my take is they?ll follow suit with the UK?s most talked about new tax ? the ?sugar tax? First things first, let?s quickly recap why the ?sugar tax? is even a thing. The World Health Organisation (WHO) regards childhood obesity as one of the most serious and significant global challenges of the 21st century. Their concerns are just. In the UK the National Child Measurement Program (NCMP) measures the height and weight of around one million schoolkids every year. Their 2014/15 results were truly shocking. Approximately 19.1% of children aged 10?11 were obese. Around 14.2% were overweight. For kids aged 4?5, 9.1% were obese and 12.8% overweight. In the UK around one in three kids are obese or overweight. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report that 25% of Australian children are obese or overweight. They rate it as a higher burden of disease than smoking. This is a problem everywhere. Who do you blame? The food industry? My view on the childhood obesity epidemic is pretty black and white ? and sometimes unpopular. If you underfeed your kid it?s child abuse. If you overfeed them it?s the same. There?s no two ways about it. As parents, you are responsible for the health and safety of your kids. There?s no question that childhood obesity is a global problem. Long term it?s a significant issue for government, welfare and healthcare systems. The University of Maryland Medical Centre lists the side effects of obesity. Type 2 Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, Coronary Artery Disease, High Cholesterol, High levels of fat in the blood, Heart Failure, Respiratory problems. Now imagine a whole generation of kids living with this in life. It will result in death far earlier than necessary. It will also result in incredible strain on healthcare systems. The Independent reports that, ?in the UK, the bill for obesity-related illnesses reaches ?5.1bn a year.? The Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine highlights, ?Compared to nonsmokers, average health costs were $1,275 higher for smokers. The incremental costs associated with obesity were even higher: $1,850 more than for normal-weight individuals. For those with morbid obesity, the excess costs were up to $5,500 per year.? It?s all just as bad in Australia. The National Health and Medical Research Council states, ?A 2009 report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicts that there will be continued increases in overweight and obesity levels across all age groups during the next decade in Australia, to around 66% of the population.? They go on to explain that, ?Data from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study indicate that the total direct cost for overweight and obesity in 2005 was $21 billion ($6.5 billion for overweight and $14.5 billion for obesity). The same study estimated indirect costs of $35.6 billion per year, resulting in an overall total annual cost of $56.6 billion (Colagiuri et al. 2010).? The world is getting fat. Kids are getting fat. Parents are getting fat. This fat epidemic is killing us and killing economies. Someone needs to put a stop to it. But who? Who do you blame? Who?s the scapegoat here? Where?s the easy out? Taking the easy route Arguments are this is an industry problem. If food and beverage industries didn?t pack so much sugar into food and drink the problem wouldn?t be as bad. This line of argument has led the British government to a world first ?sugar tax?. The tax will come in from 2018. And any soft drink with more than five grams of sugar per 100ml is in trouble. The BBC reports that, ?The Office for Budgetary Responsibility suggests the levy will add 18p [AU$0.34] or 24p [AU$0.45] per litre, or about 6p [AU$0.11] or 8p [AU$0.15] to a standard 330ml can.? That means for a Red Bull, Pepsi or Coke around 11p [AU$0.20] per can will be added to the price. This is a serious tax generation policy for the UK. Estimates are it will raise ?550 million [AU$1.042 billion] per year in extra revenue. The aim is it will go towards promoting and developing sports in schools. If that?s true ? well we?ll see how it plays out. Taxing parents doesn?t win an election The UK has set a bar that I believe other countries around the world will now follow. And I think that Australia will be next. The timing is perfect. Precedence has been set. All Scott Morrison needs to do is just follow suit. Imagine if this rolls out worldwide. In 2015 Red Bull sold 5.957 billion cans of Red Bull. Do the maths? If every Red Bull had 20-cent tax added, it would raise $1.19 billion. And that?s just Red Bull. Add it to Coke, Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Monster and RockStar. It would mean billions around the world in tax revenue. I think this ?sugar tax? is all posturing. It reeks of political vote grabbing. When you boil it down, a sugar tax won?t really reduce the occurrence of obesity. But it will take a good decade or so to see that. Meanwhile, it will raise billions for the government while making what looks like a ?socially responsible? move. Britvic Plc. [LON:BVIC], a drinks maker, plunged from ?7.09 to ?6.76 within 24 hours of the announcement. A.G Barr Plc. [LON:BAG] ? who make the popular Irn-Bru ? is down over 6% since Wednesday. Sure soft drinks are high in sugar. But so is chocolate, chips, white bread, pasta sauce, tomato sauce, cake, fruit juice, and a whole range of other foods that are just as bad for kids. The buck really stops with parents. The best and only way to tackle childhood obesity is through parents. You want to tax something to tackle obesity? Increase the income tax on parents with obese kids. See how well that goes down with voters. The sugar tax in the UK will stay. It will continue to be a vote grab with little substance. You?ll probably see it in Australia, and possibly other countries around the world. It will cost soft drink companies? big time. Companies like Britvic, A.G Barr and Coca-Cola Amatil [ASX:CCA] in Australia. With the UK setting things in motion, now might be a good time to think about exiting soft drink maker stocks. This tax is another example of the government taking the easy road out. It looks good on the surface, but doesn?t tackle the real problem. The real problem is poor choices. But taking aim at irresponsible parents doesn?t win an election; a ?sugar tax? does.

Keeping track of your blood pressure at home may provide a better indicator of your risk for heart disease and stroke than waiting to have it taken by your doctor, Japanese researchers report. The study found the risk for heart disease and stroke was greater for patients whose morning systolic blood pressure ? the top number ? measured at home was 145 mm Hg compared with reading of less than 125 mm Hg. ?In clinical practice, morning home blood pressure may predict heart disease and stroke better than office blood pressure, and be more effective in managing high blood pressure,? said lead researcher, Dr. Kazuomi Kario. He?s a professor and chairman of the division of cardiovascular medicine at Jichi Medical University School of Medicine in Tochigi, Japan. ?Few reports have investigated the predictive ability of home blood pressure for heart disease and stroke,? Kario said. ?This largest home blood pressure study is the first to demonstrate that morning home blood pressure may be superior to clinic pressure,? he said. For the study, Kario and his colleagues followed more than 21,000 patients with high blood pressure for a little over two years. The mean age of the study volunteers was 65. During the study follow-up, 127 patients had strokes and 121 developed heart problems, the findings showed. Strokes were significantly higher among those patients with a morning home systolic blood pressure of 145 mm Hg or higher, compared to those patients whose systolic blood pressure was less than 125 mm Hg. The comparable numbers for stroke risk measured in a doctor?s office were 150 and higher, and less than 130, respectively, the researchers found. The risk for heart disease was also higher among patients whose at-home systolic blood pressure was over 145 mm Hg compared to those who had blood pressure of 125 mm Hg or less at home. For the in-office reading, risk for heart disease was greater when blood pressure was 160 or higher compared to less than 130, the investigators found. The report was published online March 28 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Elevated blood pressure remains a leading cause of stroke, heart attacks, heart failure, kidney failure and premature deaths, said Dr. Gregg Fonarow. He?s a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a spokesman for the American Heart Association. Taking your blood pressure at home is relatively simple using a blood pressure measuring device. Devices are available in drugstores and other stores, and range in price from around $30 to more than $100. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends an automatic, cuff-style, upper-arm monitor for use at home. Wrist and finger monitors are not recommended because they yield less reliable readings. Monitors for the elderly or pregnant women should be validated specifically for those purposes. And, be sure the cuff fits properly, the association says. Blood pressure responds to many factors and will vary throughout the day, so a single high blood pressure reading is not an immediate cause for alarm, the AHA points out. But if you get a high reading, you should take your blood pressure several more times and consult your doctor to make sure you don?t have a problem and that your monitor is working properly, the heart group recommends. Controlling your blood pressure should be a partnership between you and your doctor, the AHA suggests. Taking your blood pressure at home is one step, and should be done with the advice and help of your doctor. ?There is increasing interest and guideline recommendations toward using blood pressure readings taken at home to assess risk and guide treatment of hypertension [high blood pressure],? Fonarow said. ?The lower the morning home blood pressure reading, the better the outcomes,? he explained. Men and women with a morning systolic blood pressure reading of less than 125 mm Hg had the lowest rates of cardiac events and strokes, Fonarow said. ?This study lends further support for integrating morning home blood pressure readings as a component of the routine clinical assessment and treatment of high blood pressure,? he added.

Former first lady Nancy Reagan has died at 94 in Bel-Air, California. Assistant Allison Borio says Mrs. Reagan died Sunday at her home of congestive heart failure. Her marriage to Ronald Reagan lasted 52 years until his death in 2004. A former actress, she was Reagan?s closest adviser and fierce protector on his journey from actor to governor of California to president of the United States. She rushed to his side after he was shot in 1981 by a would-be assassin, and later endured his nearly decade-long battle with Alzheimer?s disease. In recent years she broke with fellow Republicans in backing stem cell research as a way to possibly find a cure for Alzheimer?s. Statement from Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter on the Passing of Nancy Reagan: Rosalynn and I are saddened by the passing of former First Lady Nancy Reagan. She will always be admired for her strength of conviction and her lifelong devotion to her husband. Her ?just say no? campaign prevented many young people from falling prey to the allure of drug use; and her advocacy for stem cell research raised public awareness and influenced decision makers about vital research for Alzheimer?s disease.

The study showed a clear correlation between higher Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference and the risk of heart failure. The researchers saw that with every 10 cm increase in waist circumference was linked to a 29 percent higher risk of heart failure from the analyses of 360,000 participants. ""Overweight individuals had a 35 percent increased risk of heart failure as compared with normal weight individuals and our findings indicate that overweight should be considered a clear risk factor for heart failure,"" said first author Dagfinn Aune from Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Norway. Research showed that a BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m2, which is considered overweight, is also associated with increased risk. A higher waist-to-hip ratio was also correlated with a progressively greater risk of developing heart failure. The studies looked at the link between body mass index and the risk of death from heart failure and suggested a 26 percent higher risk for an increase of five BMI units. ""Overweight and obesity increase the risk for heart muscle disease, which is an established risk factor for heart failure,"" said Aune. The findings hold great significance for clinical guidelines on preventing heart failure and they are also important from a public health perspective. ?Physical activity and a more plant-based diet with lots of fruits and vegetables and whole grains are important to prevent overweight and obesity,"" Aune said.

Carroll, few things to improve your health and fitness levels provide as much benefit as physical activity. In 2015, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges out a report calling exercise a ""miracle cure."" Randomized controlled trials examined the effect of exercise therapy on outcomes in people with chronic diseases. Researchers found 32 trials looking specifically at the effect of exercise in pain and function of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee alone. Exercise improved those outcomes. Ten more studies showed over all, that exercise therapy increases aerobic capacity and muscle strength in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. For people (mostly middle aged men) who had a heart attack, exercise her apt reduced all causes of mortality by 27 percent and cardiac mortality by 31 percent. Fourteen additional studies showed physiological benefits in those with heart failure. Exercise has also been shown to lower blood pressure in patients with hydrate soon, and improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Twenty randomized controll d trials have showed that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can walk farther and function better if they exercise. Multiple studies have found that exercise improves physical function and health - related quality of life in people who have Parkinson's disease. Six more studies showed that exercise improves muscle power and mobility - related activities in people with multiple sclerosis. Mr. Carroll went on to mention his own struggles with maintaining an active lifestyle, which resulted in him trying a few workout programs that didn't seem to work for him. He decided to scale it back and started walking more in an attempt to complete the recommended 150 minutes of exercise in one week. He walked to lunch and when cold outside he used the elliptical machine, each totaling 30 minutes. I strongly encourage readers to take from this article what relates to their individual situation and use it to motivate you. Failing at exercise is inevitable, so do not base your entire fitness program on results from one or two workout trends or fads. Instead, work with a professional fitness instructor to develop a program specifically for you and what you enjoy doing as exercise. Your body needs some form of resistance training in order to truly maximize weight loss or improve your over all health. You can use light weights or even body weight, regardless do not settle for a routine that only includes cardio however; yes, I agree with the author when he says anything is better than doing nothing at all.",0

Hyun-Jae Kang et al. conducted clinical studies on 116 human subjects with acute myocardial infarction with a combination of cell and cytokine therapy using erythropoietin analog, darbepoetin and G-CSF. Though these attempts are promising, more studies are needed to correlate the effect of cytokines onto the conventional therapeutic platforms.55 Table 2. Local functions of various cytokine-mediated therapy IGF-1 is responsible for nuclear phospho-Akt and telomerase activity and the delaying of cardiomyocyte aging and death.56 TNF-?? and IL-6 can attenuate myocyte contractility by the immediate reduction of systolic cytosolic (Ca2+) via alterations in sarcoplasmic reticulum function and is reversible by the removal of the cytokine signal. 57 However, TNF-?? can also downregulate myocyte contractility indirectly through nitric oxide-dependent attenuation of myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity.58 The remodeling signals mediated by cytokines and progenitor cells in the infarcted myocardium can also initiate the repair process which includes phagocytosis and resorption of the necrotic tissue, survival of the regenerating myocytes, degradation and synthesis of matrix, proliferation of the myofibroblasts, vasculogenesis and progenitor cell proliferation.59 Taken together, cytokine-mediated therapy is emerging to be a novel strategy for the management of end stage MI. The anti-cytokine therapeutic agents viz. p75 TNF receptor (Fc construct, etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab) are found to reduce the inflammatory risks of MI. Certolizumab pegol is a novel TNF inhibitor which is having a comparatively high half life, since it is coupled to polyethylene glycol (PEG).60 Anti-TNF therapy was not fully successful. The main drawbacks found during clinical trials are toxicity, racial variations, polymorphism of TNF gene, adverse effects with other medications, etc. Moreover, patients with (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure Cilengitide are not advised to treat with anti-TNF-?? medications. The same effect will occur with other cytokines also.",0

There were already several projects tracking police shootings, including Fatal Encounters, and new projects at The Washington Post and the Guardian. But we felt that they left out crucial context. Why did the police become involved in these incidents in the first place? Was their use of force something that most people would consider reasonable, such as the police response after Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez opened fire on military personnel at a Chattanooga, Tenn., recruiting station? Or was it unreasonable, as with the shameful killing of Walter Scott? The most common criticism I received was that it was an attempt to demonstrate that police aren?t the problem. I?m a white Texas cop, so that?s not an unreasonable presumption. But I hope you?ll see that what we found can steer the conversation toward more productive and meaningful reforms. We began, as others did ? with the Fatal Encounters database. Where The Post?s Pulitzer Prize-winning effort focused on police shootings, we focused on all police-related deaths. And where the Guardian included killings by, for example, prison guards, or traffic accidents, or personal disputes between officers, we focused only on official acts (on- or off-duty) by police officers. Ultimately, we gathered more than 70 contextual data points, from the mundane (middle name) to the specific (if the person was listed as mentally ill, was it a previously diagnosed serious mental illness, or merely suspected?). We eventually identified 153 cases in which unarmed civilians had died after an encounter with police in 2015. We now had a wealth of contextual data that we believed could add a lot to the ongoing dialogue about police shootings. We think the context for these shootings transcends both race and politics. We have assembled our findings in a book, ?In Context: Understanding Police Killings of Unarmed Civilians,? which we believe is instructive for activists, police officers and use-of-force trainers. The context behind these shootings can also help readers understand how police and trainers approach these cases, and the applicable law they use to determine when different levels of force are justified. We tried to be objective, but true objectivity is, of course, impossible ? everyone has inherent bias. Instead, we?ve tried to be as open and transparent as we can. We included more than 500 source-footnotes in the book, as well as an open update system to track when we got something wrong. The data, methodology and schema on which we based our conclusions are all open and available under the Creative Commons Share Alike license. So please feel free to check our work. From my interpretation of the data, there are some relatively easy changes police and policymakers can make that will go a long way toward improving policing in the United States. Here are what you might call the ?low-hanging fruit?: Police must release more data, and do it sooner When agencies delay, public suspicion and speculation fill the void. Every time police choose transparency, it?s a deposit in the bank of goodwill. It builds community trust. Las Vegas has shown that a police department can be transparent and forthcoming after a police shooting without disrupting the integrity of the investigation. Honesty begins with a timely release of the earliest available information. That might include a timeline, recordings of 911 calls, a narrative and any video. Without video or 911 calls, the public has nothing but the word of the police ? and as we have seen, police do sometimes lie. Not always. Not even a lot, according to our research. But consider the Walter Scott shooting, and the apparent lies told by Officer Michael Slager. A high-profile case like that can quickly make citizens lose faith in the system. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. While the media and activists groups often focus on race, the data show a greater disparity in deadly engagements with drug addicts and the mentally ill. In 2015, nearly half ? 46 percent ? of the deaths of unarmed civilians after a police encounter involved someone suffering from serious mental illness, overdosing on drugs, or both. We tend to think of both mental health and drug addiction to be issues at the margins of society. These issues need far more social, legal and policy attention than they?re getting. One approach gaining popularity is the Memphis Model Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) for first responders. Under the CIT model, police officers are trained how to recognize the symptoms of a mental illness crisis, how to communicate with people experiencing a mental health crisis, and how to intervene without escalating. The model has been widely praised and should continue to be adopted around the country. But it is clear that the problem is bigger than just crisis management ? the work needs to start before a mentally ill person goes into crisis in the first place. We?re also seeing new programs to address that problem, with promising results. A program in the mid-cities between Dallas and Fort Worth, for example, has been successful in training cops on new ways to liaise with the mentally ill. By focusing on wellness checks in addition to crisis management, the area has seen a reduction in acute mental health crisis hospitalizations. Such creative programs stress regular visits and include outreach to friends and family. It?s a really smart way to work; it saves lives and money and arguably makes the community more strongly supportive of all its residents. Many state police academies have also been adding more training in mental health and disability. In my opinion, we need more of these programs, and with an even broader focus. But even with new training, we must remember that the police should be the last line of defense from mentally ill people who potentially pose a threat to the community. Instead, police are too often the first. The federal government has long passed the buck on mental health to the states ? under both Democratic and Republican administrations. State governments have also dropped the ball. Mental illness is a society-wide issue. It can?t just be a police issue. The buck can be passed down, but cops can?t pass the buck back up. And if we are going to insist on asking cops to respond to mental-health crises, the least we can do is give them the proper training and support. Look at all disability, not just mental illness When we add physical disability ? such as pulmonary emphysema, enlarged heart, hypertensive or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, thyroid disorder ? to that statistic, the number of unarmed citizens who died after a police encounter suffering from drugs, mental illness and/or physical disability is 52 percent. That, of course, is more than half. We need to consider as a society the effects our national health-care policies can have on policing. We also need to be make sure police are properly trained to interact with people with disabilities such as deafness or autism. Health care and policing aren?t unrelated issues. Cops alone can?t change this. It should be part of the larger conversation among activists, health-care professionals, journalists and law enforcement leaders. While it?s true that fixing the American health-care system isn?t exactly ?low-hanging fruit,? one fix that would go a long way is better coordination among police, health-care providers and advocacy groups for people with disabilities. The Americans With Disabilities Act isn?t a suggestion; it?s a mandate. It?s time our society faces the fact that when it comes to the cops, it cannot be a mandate that is unfunded and unsupported. We need more police video, but it must be used correctly Video was available only in 26 percent of the cases in which an unarmed person died after an encounter with police. In two 2015 cases, eyewitness-shot video was crucial in showing that officers had lied to investigators. In two other cases, video exonerated officers. But in all four of these cases, the video was taken by bystanders or surveillance cameras, not by police-operated video. Here?s another metric first observed by San Jose independent police auditor Walter Katz: Last year there were zero indictments of police officers in cases that did not involve video. In every case in which an officer was indicted, video was available and became an important part of the evidence supporting indictment. That?s an important metric. We need more officer video, in more places, right now. I believe proliferation of body and dash-cam cameras will mostly demonstrate that police usually get it right and perform their jobs with professionalism. But it will also show when we are at our worst. That, too, is important. I am a strong proponent of body-worn video, but it?s not as easy as merely handing out the cameras. As we?ve already seen, there are significant challenges to developing practical policies and procedures that bring transparency, while still protecting citizen privacy and police officers? due process. Rank-and-file officers, union representatives (where appropriate) and community leaders and activists should be consulted during the policy-building process so that there are no surprises. Sometimes, policy can be counterintuitive (for a truly surprising read, have a look at the how the Los Angeles Sheriff?s Department handled the thorny issue of whether officers should be permitted to view video before writing their reports). There are also logistical, technological and financial barriers that need hashing out. Deaths in police custody aren?t always from shootings Police shootings get most of the media coverage, but in nearly half of the 153 cases in which cops killed an unarmed citizen in 2015, no shots were fired at all. The decedent was killed in another manner. In most of these cases, autopsy reports found that the deceased had an abnormal reaction or complication after officers deployed tools or techniques with the intent of using of non-deadly force, such as stun guns or chemical spray. Many of these cases include the drug-related, mental-health-related deaths described previously, as well as other incidents in which decedents with chronic health conditions or a physical disability attacked or resisted officers or others. In 23 of the 83 cases (27 percent) in which there were shootings, officers deployed a Taser prior to shooting. To my colleagues and me, this is a good indication that officers were attempting to subdue suspects who ultimately died by first using non-deadly force. That would be consistent with current best practices. That conclusion has frustrated some observers, because activists and reformers have pointed to Tasers as weapons that cause too many deaths. Part of the problem is that there?s a lot of confusion in the general public about a weapon?s potential to cause death and whether it should be considered ?deadly force? by law, practice and training. Without devolving into a festival of scholarly citations, the law is quite clear about this: ?Deadly force? is force that poses a significant risk of death or serious bodily injury. Legal experts have tended to agree that ?significant risk? means ?more likely than not.? Some people have indeed died proximate to Taser exposure, but the numbers are very small. Independent, non-Taser-funded research has repeatedly shown that the percentage of people exposed to a Taser who die soon after that exposure is minuscule, and even among those cases, it?s difficult to establish a causal link (see, for example, this Arizona State University study or this NIJ study). There have been millions of Taser exposures, and very few deaths. In definition and in practice, Taser is non-deadly force. Our data show that in nearly a third of the cases in which officers used deadly force, they first attempted non-deadly force. Yes, there have been awful examples of Taser-proximate injuries suffered when an officer used the weapon not because a suspect was fighting, but to gain control, or out of anger. That is generally a fireable offense (and sometimes a criminal act). But that?s a separate issue from the cases my team studied, in which police officers faced a real threat and deployed a Taser to stop a potentially deadly incident by using non-deadly force. Consider, if you will, the death of Omar Lopez last year. Lopez had been fighting a passenger on the SEPTA train in Philadelphia when a police officer intervened. Lopez bit and violently fought with the officer. The officer, armed with a .40 Sig Sauer pistol and a baton, continued to struggle and ultimately used his Taser alone. Lopez died, but the autopsy showed his cause of death to be an overdose of PCP. That officer, like officers in many of the incidents we studied, showed tremendous restraint. When we credit officers who first opt for non-deadly force, others are less likely to reach first for their guns. I think reasonable people would agree. Each of these reforms is individually actionable. None is dependent on the others, and few seem all that divisive or controversial. With a couple of exceptions, the solution for each is relatively inexpensive, relatively uncomplicated and relatively understandable. Once we can see beyond the ?how many? of police-involved killings and look instead to the ?why,? we can start to have meaningful conversations about how to reduce them. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2016/06/20/guest-post-the-low-hanging-fruit-of-police-reform/",0

These small fruits seem to be a good indicator of healthy eating, with fans of grapes seemingly more likely to eat sufficient amounts of other foods that are good for health, as well as being less likely to tuck into unhealthy foods. So, based on your intake of grapes, how healthy IS your diet?! Grapes Pack a Healthy Punch Grapes have long been known to be good for people?s health ? a single cup provides more than a quarter of your recommended daily intake of vitamins C and K, is packed full of antioxidants, yet only includes about 100 calories. The berries are thought to help fight heart disease, cancer, nerve disease, viral infections and even Alzheimer?s disease. And now it seems they provide a good indication of the health credentials of a person?s overall diet. Researchers obtained data on more than 21,800 people?s diets from the 2003-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Results showed that people who regularly ate grapes and non-alcoholic grape products ? such as raisins and 100% grape juice ? typically had healthier dietary patterns and better nutrient intakes than those who did not. Grape consumers tended to have higher intakes of fruit as a whole, as well as vitamins A, B6 and C, dietary fiber, calcium, magnesium and potassium. Grapes Linked To Healthier Eating In General As well as being a good source of several nutrients, it seems that grape eating may be associated with improved diets in general. Grape consumers typically ate more vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds than non-consumers. And they tended to eat fewer added sugars and less total fat, saturated fat and dietary cholesterol. As lead author Dr Carla McGill observed: ?Not only did grape consumers have increased intakes of healthy foods and critical vitamins and minerals, but grape consumers also ate less of unhealthy foods, specifically solid fat and added sugars.? Jean-Mari Peltier, executive director of the National Grape and Wine Initiative, commented: ?It reinforces the association between grapes and a healthier diet, which is good news for consumers. Grapes, raisins and 100% grape juice are all foods that people enjoy eating, and this information adds another dimension to the grape and health story.? How Are Grapes Good For You? Here are just a handful of reasons why grapes are good for you: Resveratrol, a polyphenol compound found mainly in grape skins, is thought to provide a number of physiological benefits, including antifungal properties, modulating lipid metabolism and inhibiting the oxidation of LDL (?bad cholesterol?) and aggregation of platelets. It may even have benefits for Alzheimer?s disease Grape seeds contain a number of constituents with apparent health benefits, possibly helping to ward off cancer, heart failure and other conditions involving oxidative stress They?re low in fat so make the ideal snack food for those trying to lose weight Antioxidants in grapes provide a number of benefits, including possibly for eye and bladder health http://www.gnet.org/grape-eaters-tend-to-have-healthier-diets/",0

But in reality, a heart attack victim could easily be a woman, and the scene not be so dramatic. While men and women share some of the same symptoms, the University of Alabama?s Dr Joseph Fritz explains they can also have wildly different ones. Both men and women can suffer chest tightness and pain or pressure in the chest, neck, jaw, arms or back. Unusual fatigue, shortness of breath, coughing, feeling sick and vomiting are among the unpleasant symptoms experienced by both genders. OTHER MAJOR SYMPTOMS FOR MEN INCLUDE Weakness Breaking out into a cold sweat Dizziness MAJOR SYMPTOMS FOR WOMEN INCLUDE Sleep disturbance Indigestion Anxiety However, Dr Fritz also urged people to remember each heart attack is different and symptoms may not always exactly fit the mould. Never ignore any possible symptoms of a heart attack, and get medical attention immediately. Women?s heart attack symptoms can include indigestion and sleep disturbance, which can be mistaken for signs of something else. Women are likely than men to die within a year of their first attack Women are more likely than men to die within a year of their first heart attack, according to the American Heart Association. That is because while both genders experience chest pain as the primary symptom, women often have atypical, vague symptoms as well ? such as back or jaw pain, nausea or a sense of dread. Earlier this year, Dr Laxmi Mehta, of Ohio State University, said: ?These symptoms can be very challenging for the patient and the medical profession. ?Women tend to under recognise or deny them. ?When they do present to the emergency department, it is important for these symptoms to be triaged appropriately as potential heart problems. ?Otherwise the consequences are misdiagnosis, delayed treatment and higher death rates.? Even things considered more minor health problems such as sexual health, bleeding gums and even snoring could be a sign of poor heart health. When the heart and arteries begin to fail, symptoms manifest in otherwise unrelated parts in the body, revealed Dr John Erwin, a cardiologist from Texas A&M Health Science Center. Dr Erwin revealed six of the most common ? and most surprising ? symptoms of heart disease that people need to be aware of. Keeping an eye out for these problems can lead to earlier detection of the disease ? and help save lives. SYMPTOM 1: SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION Many people think of sexual dysfunction as a problem of the reproductive organs ? or the brain. However, especially in males, sexual dysfunction is a common symptom of arterial disease. Erectile dysfunction is typically thought to be a problem of the brain or reproductive system. However, it can also occur because of a buildup of plaque in the arteries ? which can lead to cardiovascular disease A buildup of plaque in the arteries can cause men to have a hard time achieving ? or maintaining erection. But for women, a drop in libido usually signals a post-menopausal state. Yet, women who are post-menopausal ?rapidly increase? their risk factors for developing heart disease. Menopause itself doesn?t cause cardiovascular disease. Dr Erwin said: ?While menopause doesn?t cause cardiovascular diseases, certain heart-health risks ? like changes in blood pressure and cholesterol levels ? begin around the time of menopause.? Furthermore, many women develop a more sedentary lifestyle in that phase of their lives. As a result, this symptom should not be ignored. SYMPTOM 2: SNORING OR SLEEP APNEA Few things are more frustrating in life than trying to sleep next to a snoring person. However, on top of the annoyance of snoring, Dr Erwin revealed it can actually be a sign of heart disease. Snoring is a common sign of sleep apnea ? as is morning sleepiness after a full night?s sleep. Dr Erwin said: ?Sleep apnea ? periods of time during sleep where you stop breathing ? is associated with many physiological changes that increase the risk of both heart attack and stroke.? Snoring may be annoying, but it is a symptom of sleep apnea ? which can often signify heart disease Snoring can also be a sign of atrial fibrillation ? which is an irregular, often rapid heart rate that causes poor blood flow. Therefore, detection and treatment of sleep apnea can lower a person?s risk of heart problems. So, next time you hear the person next to you snoring, perhaps suggest they see a doctor ? instead of just complaining about the noise. SYMPTOM 3: BLEEDING, SORE OR SWOLLEN GUMS Few people would ever think that gum problems could be linked to heart disease. However, unhealthy gums are a symptom of periodontis. That is a serious gum infection that damages the gums ? and can destroy the jawbone. Periodontis can actually lead to an increase in inflammation across the body, according to Dr Erwein. And, over-activity of inflammatory pathways is a strong risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic heart disease and heart attack. Thus, it?s recommended that people follow up regularly with their dentist for oral hygiene. They should also regularly brush and floss their teeth. SYMPTOM 4: SHOULDER OR NECK CONSTRICTION OR ACHING Many people feel like an ?elephant is sitting on their chest? during a heart attack. And many others experience ?a squeezing sensation in their arms.? However, not all people go through those ?classic? heart attack feelings. Constriction or aching in the shoulder or neck ? or swollen and bleeding gums ? may appear to be minor health problems, but in reality they can be symptoms of heart disease ? and should be checked out by a doctor Instead, many heart attack sufferers feel an uncomfortable sensation, achiness, pain or pressure in their neck, jaw or shoulders. For some, that discomfort is the ?only sign of heart pain or a heart attack?. SYMPTOM 5: PUFFY FEET AND LEGS Feet and legs can swell for a variety of reasons ? including something as minor as heat. However, puffy legs and feet can also be a marker of congestive heart failure. That?s particularly true in cases where a person has unusual shortness of breath with activity ? or when trying to sleep. While it?s also true that some swelling occurs naturally throughout the day, and tends to resolve overnight, persistent swelling is problematic. People who have constant or worsening swelling of the feet or legs should see a doctor for an evaluation of heart failure. SYMPTOM 6: INDIGESTION OR HEARTBURN Heartburn and indigestion are quite common ? and rarely serious. But in some instances, those seemingly benign burning or aching sensations in the upper abdomen can be a sign of heart pain or heart attack. Additionally, persistent gastrointestinal distress ? such as intractable hiccups ? can also be a precursor. And so, when heartburn, indigestion or hiccups are mixed with nausea, sweating, shortness of breath or lightheadedness, people should seek medical attention. Dr Erwin said: ?It?s not uncommon to see people come into the emergency room after chewing on antacids for hours before they realize the pain is something more.?

Blacks often have stiffer vessels and I'd go with a dihydropyridine CCB over a thiazide initially, in the absence of heart failure. In a black with heart failure, we'd be looking at an ACEi/ARB first, followed by a beta-blocker (bisoprolol, metoprolol-XR, carvedilol, or nebivolol, only), followed by spironolactone, followed by hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate. I'm over-simplifying the HF Tx scheme for the sake of this thread, but the two points I want to make are 1) blacks benefit from afterload reduction (so in the absence of HF it makes no sense to choose a thiazide over a dCCB), and 2) hydralazine + isosorbide dinitrate, as a combination, yields extra mortality benefit in this group, in the setting of heart failure. I was under the impression that most physicians use thiazide like HCTZ in African Americans (AA) because of their diuretic effects (i.e their mechanism of action) since it's well known that AA use a lot of salt in their diet.

It is found in many selenium-rich fruits and vegetables and some animal products. To say that selenium is important is an understatement. Low selenium levels are actually linked to conditions such as Keshan disease[2], heart disease[3], and infertility.[4] Let?s look at what selenium means to your health. 1. Selenium Is A Powerful Antioxidant Selenium works as a powerful antioxidant in the body.[5] Antioxidants are substances that slow or prevent cell damage by neutralizing free radicals. Selenium protects against free radicals and oxidative stress. It?s an active immunomodulator and a more potent antioxidant than vitamins A, C, or E.[6] Selenium combines with other proteins to create selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases. These proteins act as antioxidants to support health at the cellular level.[7] 2. Thyroid Support The thyroid is a gland in the throat that produces hormones. The hormones produced by the thyroid affect growth and metabolic processes. Compared to other tissue in the human body, the thyroid contains the most selenium per gram.[8] Like iodine, selenium plays an important role in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. There have been many studies on selenium and thyroid disease, often with mixed or contradictory results. One study linked low selenium levels to thyroid problems in the elderly. Unfortunately, in that instance, selenium supplementation did little to help.[9] However, another study found that selenium supplementation during pregnancy reduced hypothyroidism and inflammation.[10] Yet another study found selenium supplementation decreases the negative effects of Hashimoto?s thyroiditis.[11] More research is needed to draw conclusions, but the potential of selenium as it relates to thyroid health is encouraging. 3. Anti-Aging Properties of Selenium Free radical damage causes the cellular degeneration we know as aging.[12] As a powerful antioxidant, selenium neutralizes the damaging effects of free radicals. One study revealed that selenium levels decline with age and low selenium contributes to cognitive decline in older adults.[13, 14] There is great interest in determining whether selenium supplementation can slow age-related mental impairment. Hopefully, we learn more soon. 4. Encourages Metal Detoxification Metals are among the most toxic of pollutants. Effective ways to detoxify the body of toxic metals are few and far between. The good news? Data suggests that supplementing with organic (carbon-bound) selenium supports mercury excretion.[15] 5. Cardiovascular Support It?s clear that there is a relationship between selenium concentration and cardiovascular health. Some heart attack patients show low selenium levels[3] and incidences of heart failure caused by selenium deficiency have been reported since as early as 1937.[16] Not only is selenium itself important for cardiovascular support, it works with other nutrients such as vitamin E and beta-carotene to help promote normal cholesterol levels.[17] 6. Reproductive Health Selenium is critical for both male and female reproductive health. It enables sperm locomotion and a selenium deficiency can lead to male infertility.[18] Studies have found that low selenium can also have a negative impact on female fertility and fetal growth.[4] There seems to be a link between selenium deficiency and miscarriage, but more research is necessary to determine the exact mechanism.[19] 7. Selenium and Cancer Studies have observed a trend in which lower concentrations of selenium correlated with an increased risk of certain types of cancer.[20, 21] Although this is an interesting tidbit of information, it shouldn?t be interpreted as an implication that selenium is a treatment or method of prevention for cancer. While selenium has many benefits, there is not conclusive evidence to call it a viable treatment option. How Selenium Benefits Your Health We do know that selenium is an essential mineral that?s crucial to many bodily functions. Natural sources, like fruits and vegetables, are the best way to incorporate selenium into your diet. Selenium supplementation may also be appropriate for people who are experiencing a selenium deficiency.[4] If you?re concerned that you?re not getting enough selenium, talk to your nutritionist and see if selenium supplementation is right for you.

My prayers can be prayers of gratitude for my food, to praise as I see that magnificent tree with purple flowers outside my living room window to an answer to my prayers, as I get visits from my family and friends. I'm very, very grateful for these visits, as I do feel alone a lot, facing such serious, life threatening illnesses. I voice even more prayers to my God, as I live through my day.

The data compared Vericel's bone marrow-derived ixmyelocel-T stem cells with placebo in 109 well-treated patients with advanced ischemic heart failure who had exhausted optimal medical and device therapies. After one year, the Vericel treatment led to a 37 percent reduction versus placebo in a composite of adverse events that included death, heart-related hospitalizations and unplanned clinic visits related to heart failure. Vericel last month reported that the study succeeded. Detailed results were unveiled on Monday at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in Chicago and in the Lancet medical journal. The result was primarily driven by the difference in deaths of 13.7 percent in the placebo group, or 7 deaths, compared with 3.4 percent, or 2 deaths, for those who received ixmyelocel-T therapy. In addition, 38 percent of stem cell patients required hospitalization, versus 47 percent for the placebo group. ""This is strong evidence in a well-designed trial that we can decrease events,"" said Dr. Timothy Henry, the study's lead investigator and chief of cardiology at Cedars Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles. ""For patients, this is a really hopeful thing."" The stem cell treatment failed to lead to a significant improvement in heart pumping efficiency or six-minute walking distance, which were among secondary goals of the trial. Henry, who presented the data at the ACC meeting, stressed the need for larger trials to prove the benefit of ixmyelocel-T For the treatment, bone marrow is taken from the patient and enhanced over two weeks to increase two types of cells associated with healing. They are then injected directly into the patient's heart. With advanced heart failure, a leading cause of hospitalizations, blood-pumping ability is diminished as the heart's left ventricle becomes enlarged and weakened. Virtually all those in the study were taking medicines to lower cholesterol and blood pressure and had an implantable device to regulate heart rhythm. If the disease worsens despite all available medicinal and interventional therapies, the only options are heart transplant or a pumping assist device. ""The idea is to find a treatment for this group of people before they get to that stage,"" Henry said. (Editing by Bernadette Baum)",0

He was 80. White, whose credits span theater, film and television, died on Monday night in Ojai, California, at the home of ex-wife Louise White, the producer's former girlfriend, Lyndall Hobbs, told Reuters. ""It (Other OTC: ITGL - news) would seem he died of heart failure having been told about 8 weeks ago that he needed open heart surgery but he was too weak for surgery,"" Hobbs, a filmmaker, said, adding that his ex-wife and son had cared for him as his ""health deteriorated rapidly."" ""Michael had an appetite for life that was unmatched in my opinion,"" Hobbs said. ""A unique man who put on hundreds of shows and truly was a theatrical pioneer."" Born in Glasgow, Scotland, White began his career producing plays on London's West End with shows such as ""Oh! Calcutta,"" ""The Rocky Horror Show"" and ""Annie."" He transitioned into films, producing numerous projects including British cult classic comedy ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" in 1974, and ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" in 1978. Most recently, White was the subject of a 2013 documentary ""The Last Impresario,"" directed by Gracie Otto, which followed his exuberant life mingling with the A-list in London and featured interviews with friends and colleagues including Kate Moss and John Cleese. Supermodel Moss was on hand to present White with the Special Award, honoring lifetime achievements, at Britain's Olivier Awards in 2014.

Many health care professional bodies are now developing specialist expertise in heart failure. This is true for cardiologists in training, consultant cardiologists, care of the elderly and general physicians, cardiothoracic surgeons, primary care doctors, pharmacists and specialist nurses. With advances in medical therapy, the prognosis of the condition has improved dramatically. Whereas once heart failure was a pre-terminal diagnosis, now for many it is treatable. However, some patients remain symptomatic and at high risk of death despite maximal medical therapy. These patients can benefit from a range of novel device therapies. For those who remain symptomatic despite optimal treatment cardiac transplantation remains an option. This updated book comprehensively covers all aspects necessary to manage a patient with heart failure. It gives simple, clear advice on the diagnosis, investigation and treatment options available highlighting the current evidence-base. The chapters provide concise and objective information to guide all health care professionals involved in the modern day multi-disciplinary management of the syndrome. The book is set out logically to mirror the patient journey in heart failure. An updated edition of the first practical manual of heart failure management.

Nocturia is different from enuresis, which in enuresis, urination occurs unconsciously during sleep, or in everyday terms is often referred to as the ?wetting?. Nocturia is one of the common causes of sleep disorders, and usually experienced by people who are elderly. Nearly two-thirds of adults aged 55 to 84 years of experience nocturia for a few nights each week. Although nocturia generally occur in people who are elderly, but basically nocturia could happen to anyone, whether male or female, old or young. Nocturia a relatively light will cause the person experiencing woke up at least 2 times throughout the night. For nocturia were classified as severe, usually will cause those who experience awakened as much as 5 to 6 times a night. The impact, in addition to disrupt the quality of sleep, nocturia (especially those classified as heavy) will lead to other complaints such as dizziness, drowsiness, and fatigue the next day, and even depression. Causes of Nocturia The cause of nocturia in women and men are usually different. Women generally experience nocturia as a consequence of childbirth, menopause, and uterine prolapse (descent of the uterus) or also called down. While in men, nocturia can be caused by enlargement of the prostate. Other causes of nocturia is likely due to the use of medications (especially those that are diuretics), and may also be due to health problems such as heart failure, diabetes, urinary tract infection (infection cause a burning sensation and desire for frequent urination all day and night), high blood pressure, liver disorders, sleep apnea syndrome OAB (overactive bladder), kidney infections, tumors of the bladder, prostate or pelvic area, and as a result of neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson. Some cases of nocturia are also caused or exacerbated by excessive fluid intake after dinner, especially fluid from beverages containing caffeine and alcohol, which is a diuretic. While the elderly, nocturia occurs because the elderly, less body produces antidiuretic hormone, a hormone that is useful to hold urine (urine). Along with age, antidiuretic hormone levels in the body will decrease, and with the decreasing levels of antidiuretic hormone, then your kidneys produce more urine at night, and thus the frequency of urination will increase. In addition, nocturia may also be due to the decreased ability to accommodate the urinary bladder. Where, it is usually also influenced by health condition has also decreased in the elderly (older), which in turn influence bladder function and the ability to accommodate and hold urine.",0

I am worried if they send her home because she lives alone and there is no one to help her. I live 1500 miles away from her and I take care of our 90 yr. old mother. It would be difficult to leave my mother to help her, but she doesn't want me to help her anyway. In fact it stressed her out so much when I mentioned getting someone else to stay with our mother for a while so I could come and help her out. Anyway, I don't know what to think and I am worried that they won't get her arrhythmia under control and she may need more care in a rehab. She hasn't walked in over 2 months because of the edema and ascites and now I realize she must have been majorly out of breath in doing the littlest things. There are so many complications that I just don't know how she will be able to live by herself if they send her home. Before she was diagnosed with CHF she was thinking she had bronchitis. So a lot of self-diagnosing going on. I don't know if she has been evaluated for a new liver, or if she is even eligible. May I ask what would keep her off the transplant list at this point? Just your opinion. I know the usual things that would keep her off the list like continuing to drink alcohol, or smoking and of course other co-morbidities. Is CHF considered a co-morbidity? I would think that a transplant may help her cirrhosis and CHF and any renal failure she may have. I am pretty sure the CHF is caused by portal hypertension or pulmonary hypertension caused by cirrhosis and I suppose this diagnosis has stages too. She said that her heart is very weak because apparently this has been going on for some time. She only saw a gastroenterologist for 5 yrs after her diagnosis of cirrhosis, even though I pushed her many times to see a hepatologist instead. She just didn't take her diagnosis seriously I guess. Sorry if I am all over the place with this! And I am sorry to hear that you have this diagnosis too. It is difficult to deal with. If you have any more advice, I would love to hear it. And prayers for you too. TY",0

Dunno, there is a ""link"" or connection missing in Popular History here I think. I am thinking... I suspect Martha Bolton who was there. But, there is a gap (in my knowledge) as to how it went from a secret, unmarked grave dug by the Fords (Liddil had been shot in the leg) to Ford and Liddil surrendering to Sheriff Timberlake for Hite's murder, on the condition that they would receive pardons and a reward. The story does not add up. Who snitched? How did the law know? I see the pardon and reward as being for giving info on James and not on shooting Hite. Ford claimed that he met with governor Crittenden who agreed to pardon Ford for the murder of Wood Hite if he would deliver Jesse James, dead or alive. Liddil must have confessed to sheriff Timberlake (but why?) Ford shot James shortly after James heard of Liddil's confession of killing Hite. Ford claimed that he believed James would kill him after learning of the murder. After the death of James, Ford stood trial for Hite's murder and was found guilty, though he was later pardoned. Liddil was rearrested for the murder of Hite in 1891, but was later released and dying of heart failure three months later. m",0

Reagan died on Sunday of heart failure at the age of 94 at her home in the Bel Air suburb of Los Angeles, 12 years after Ronald Reagan, who served two terms in the White House in the 1980s. Representatives of presidential families stretching back to the Kennedys attended, with First Lady Michelle Obama and former first lady and ex-secretary of state Hillary Clinton joining former president George W. Bush in the front row. James Baker, chief of staff under Reagan and George H.W. Bush, described Nancy as ?a woman without whom Ronald Wilson Reagan would never have become the 40th president of the United States or succeeded as well as he did.? ?She had an instinct for reading people that the president knew he lacked. Nancy, he wrote, sees the goodness in people. But she also had an extra instinct that allowed her to see the flaws,? Baker said. The Reagans were former actors and many of the 1980s Hollywood glitterati, including then-sex symbol Bo Derek, Oscar winner Anjelica Huston, Magnum PI actor Tom Selleck and the A-Team?s Mr T were were expected among around 1,000 guests who began arriving under sunny skies several hours ahead of the ceremony. The former first lady?s funeral opened with a musical prelude by the Santa Susana High School Advanced Women?s Choir and Abbe Road A Cappella, and an instrumental section by the First Marine Division Band, Marine Corps Camp Pendleton. - Love letters - Stuart Kenworthy, the vicar of Washington National Cathedral, presided over the 90-minute program, which opened with ?Battle Hymn of the Republic? and included renditions of ?Ave Maria? and ?Pie Jesu? by soprano Ana Maria Martinez. The Reagans wrote passionate love notes to each other over the decades, and former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney read out a letter the president wrote to Nancy on their first Christmas in the White House in 1981. Reagan quotes from ?Sonnet 43,? Elizabeth Barrett Browning?s love letter to her future husband, the poet Robert Browning, better known by its opening line: ?How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.? ?For me, there is no way to count. I love the whole gang of you: mommy, First Lady, the sentimental you, the fun you and the Peewee Powerhouse you,? Reagan wrote. A fierce protector of her husband and his political legacy, Reagan had outsized influence during their White House years from 1981 to 1989. The couple wed in 1952 after Ronald divorced his first wife, actress Jane Wyman. The marriage has been described as a love story to rival any that the couple acted out on the silver screen. The pair had two children ? Patti Davis, born in 1952, and Ron Junior, born in 1958, both of whom delivered eulogies that, along with a tribute from former NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, had the guests laughing at fondly recounted anecdotes. - Challenging relationship - Davis was also searingly honest about her memories of her mother, recalling a ?challenging and often contentious relationship.? ?When I was a child, I imagined having warm, comfortable conversations with her, the kind of conversations that feel like lamp light. The reality was far different,? she said. ?I tried her patience and she intimidated me. We were never mild with one another.? While in the White House Nancy Reagan actively participated in her husband?s campaigns, approved members of the president?s cabinet, and was the face of the administration?s Just Say No drugs campaign. Ronald Reagan suffered from Alzheimer?s disease after leaving office and went into a long decline. His wife took care of him until his death and became a tireless advocate for Alzheimer?s research. President Barack Obama and his wife praised Nancy Reagan?s ?proud example? in a statement after her death, saying she redefined the role of first lady. As a ?mark of respect? Obama ordered that flags be flown at half-staff at federal buildings, military posts, US naval vessels and diplomatic missions until sunset Friday. spc-ft/pst",0

Dr. Leonard Coldwell.com. Ingredients promethazine and diphenhydramine ?slowed brain function? Block chemical acetylcholine involved in transmitting electrical impulses Researchers said the drugs had an effect for a month after treatment A full list of implicated medications can be viewed at Ageing Brain Care Or scroll down for a full list of the medications listed in the study Common over-the-counter medicines should be avoided by older people as they have been linked to memory loss and problems in thinking, scientists have discovered. Treatments for colds and flu, hay fever, allergy and heartburn tablets containing anti-cholinergic drugs had the effect for one month after treatment, a study found. Effects associated with taking the drugs included having slower brain processing times and smaller brains overall. Well known treatments including the heartburn medicine Zantac, Night Nurse Liquid containing Promethazine and the sleeping tablet Nytol, containing diphenhydramine, are included among drugs that may result in the effects, the research said. Over the counter treatments for cold, flu, heartburn and sleeping tablets were found to block the chemical acetylcholine, which is involved in the transmission of electrical impulses between nerve cells The drugs block the chemical acetylcholine, which is involved in the transmission of electrical impulses between nerve cells. The treatments are prescribed for a wide range of conditions, including Parkinson?s disease, overactive bladder, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, nausea and vomiting, sleeping problems, high blood pressure, depression and psychosis. But the authors warn: ?Use of AC [anti-cholinergic] medication among older adults should likely be discouraged if alternative therapies are available.? Previous studies have linked the drugs with cognitive impairment, increased risk of dementia and falls. However, the new study by Indiana University School of Medicine, is the first to explore their impact on brain metabolism and atrophy through brain scans. Dr Shannon Risacher, the university?s assistant professor of radiology and imaging sciences, said: ?These findings provide us with a much better understanding of how this class of drugs may act upon the brain in ways that might raise the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia,? ?Given all the research evidence, physicians might want to consider alternatives to anticholinergic medications if available when working with their older patients. ?The impact of these drugs have been know about for over a decade, with a 2013 study finding drugs with a strong anticholinergic effect cause cognitive problems when taken continuously for as few as 60 days. Drugs with a weaker effect could cause impairment within 90 days.? Many over the counter medicines have been linked to slower brain processing times and smaller brains The new study involved 451 participants, 60 of whom were taking at least one medication with medium or high anticholinergic activity. The participants were drawn from a national Alzheimer?s research project ? the Alzheimer?s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ? and the Indiana Memory and Ageing Study. To identify possible physical and physiological changes that could be associated with the reported effects, researchers assessed the results of memory and other cognitive tests, positron emission tests (PET) measuring brain metabolism, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for brain structure. Patients taking anticholinergic drugs performed worse than older adults not taking the drugs on short-term memory and some tests of executive function, which cover a range of activities such as verbal reasoning, planning, and problem solving. Anticholinergic drug users also showed lower levels of glucose metabolism ? a biomarker for brain activity ? in both the overall brain and in the hippocampus, a region of the brain associated with memory and which has been identified as affected early by Alzheimer?s disease. The researchers also found significant links between brain structure revealed by the MRI scans and anticholinergic drug use, with the participants using anticholinergic drugs having reduced brain volume and larger ventricles, the cavities inside the brain. Professor Risacher added: ?These findings might give us clues to the biological basis for the cognitive problems associated with anticholinergic drugs, but additional studies are needed if we are to truly understand the mechanisms involved.? The study was published in the journal JAMA Neurology. John Smith, Chief Executive of the Proprietary Association of Great Britain, which represents makers of over the counter medicines, said the medicines linked to the study were not intended to be used on a daily basis. Anticholinergic medicines include some over-the-counter allergy and cold and flu products. However they are intended for short term relief of symptoms only He said: ?It is important to note that the JAMA study only involved people with a mean age of 73 in what the researchers conceded was a small sample. The study followed people who took medicines that were low, medium or high in anticholinergic activity, and concluded that the use of medication with medium or high anticholinergic activity should be discouraged in older adults if alternative therapies are available. ?However, due to the study limitations, the researchers propose that further and more advanced studies are needed. ?Anticholinergic medicines include some over-the-counter allergy and cold and flu products but these are intended for short term relief of symptoms and not for continuous use as in the research. ?If anyone has any concerns about their medicine, we would advise them to talk to their pharmacist. ?There is a range of different allergy, cold and flu products on the market which contain different ingredients, many of which were not considered in this study, and a pharmacist will be able to recommend a suitable product. ?All over-the-counter medicines in the UK have been approved by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and are rigorously assessed for safety and efficacy. ?Once on the market, their safety is continually monitored in light of any emerging evidence.?

Sometimes we have to let go of our pride because we cant do it all alone. Please, if any of you could help in some small way it would be greatly appreciated and I would be forever thankful. Thank you all for your time. God bless and keep you.

These things combined keeps my chest cavity in pain, causes it to feel like it is trying to jump out of my chest, and makes it difficult to breathe. I have also found out that in my lower back I have a deteriorated disc , a bulging disc, and arthritis in every vertebrae all the way down into my tailbone. I also have curvatures in the upper part of my back that causes the muscles to spasm and shoots the pain throughout my ribcage and up into the top of the vertebrae causing bad headaches.

Why? The heart is a dynamic organ; the cardiomyocytes excitation-contraction is controlled by 3 dynamic systems ? the electrical, the Ca2+ signaling, and the contractile system. Previous research and drug development often targeted a single molecule or a single system. However, because of the feedback interactions between these non-linear dynamic systems, a change in one system can engender unexpected changes in all systems, causing the drug effect to be unpredictable. We envision that development of effective antiarrhythmic drug therapies require a paradigmatic shift from targeting a single molecule or a single system to a new strategy that embraces the integrated behaviour of the 3 dynamical systems. Our interdisciplinary team combines modelling with experimental investigations using molecular and cellular cardiology, chemistry, physics and mathematics to advance research in 3 aspects: (1) developing innovative technologies; (2) studying the fundamental mechanisms of mechano-chemo-electro-transduction in cardiac muscle; (3) developing new drug therapies to combat heart diseases. http://www.bme.ucdavis.edu/izulab Tags:  Published: Tue Feb 23 05:52:39 EST 2016",0

Sorry not to have replied sooner but my computer had a few bad days and I couldn't get into it properly. That (hopefully) has been sorted! All that you said is so true and expresses how I feel. Most of the time when I've been ill, once very much a touch and go time with peritonitious. I've been able to look at it as something that I will recover from, even if it takes a long time and a lot of work, I knew I could make a full recovery and go back to my old life, putting the illness behind me. A cardiac illness is something different, it's not the only illness that has this effect, but for me, and most of us, it is the first time I have had to realise that this, even if I improve a lot and feel good, things will never be the same and I will always have to, as you say be vigilent also except the fact that I am not immortal. At first, after the angio, I was so relieved that no immediate surgery was needed and that the Consultant said that I have very much better than my echo had implyed. It was such a relief! After a week or so, the reality came to me that actually, I so have valvular disease and heart failure caused by my left ventricule being unable to pump properly and the strange heart rythum. Thats when the obbession started. Also a sense of loss, things I may never do again, housework piling up, even with an understanding and helpful husband, some things have not been done. I am not the sort of person to care a lot about this normally and have, in the past left things undone because I've been working or doing something more interesting. Anyway, I hope that with time and maybe help, I will get through this. I am already beginining to feel stronger, both physically and mentally. Actually I think the things go hand in hand. I still have days, more often than not, when I feel overwhelmed. My GP also says that this is inevitable and part of coming to terms with life as it is now. She also said that the consultant was pleased with the findings. I see him again in on 31st May, so fingers crossed. I hope this makes sense, I am still finding it hard to put into words.

But did you know that smoking at night can disrupt and make sleep soundly? Cigarettes not only make people less sleep, but is also responsible for changing the pattern of sleep that makes sleep was not restful. Smoking can interfere with sleep in many ways. The most dramatic effect of smoking is the reduction of time spent sleeping in, which is known to create a fresh feeling when you wake up in the morning. In 2008, the journal Chest reported that chronic smokers spend more time sleeping lightly (do not sleep soundly), especially in the early part of the night, as reported by Livestrong. The culprit is nicotine, which has a stimulating effect on the nervous system. Ironically, because the nicotine in the bloodstream is reduced throughout the night, the withdrawal symptoms increased. Symptoms include anxiety and insomnia (difficulty sleeping). Smoking is also a risk factor for sleep disorders dangerous known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). According to the Mayo Clinic, smokers are three times more likely to suffer from OSA compared to people who never smoked. During OSA, the airways will be narrowed or blocked, preventing enough oxygen from reaching the brain during sleep. Snoring very loud and woke gasping are two common symptoms of OSA, which if left untreated can lead to pulmonary hypertension, heart failure and premature death. Smoking increases the risk for OSA because the habit irritate the lining of the throat and cause clogged at night. The good news, quit smoking immediately can improve sleep health.",0

COFFEE Avoid if you take -Bronchodilators for asthma These help patients to breathe more easily by relaxing the muscles in the lungs and widening airways. Common side effects of these include palpitations, nervousness and excitability. When mixed with caffeine these risks are increased.Too much caffeine can also limit their effectiveness in an emergency, so speak to your GP if you are taking them but need caffeine too. . BANANAS Avoid if you take -Blood pressure medicines Bananas are high in potassium, a good thing, but for those taking medication like Captopril, ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin receptor blockers, avoid large quantities of potassium-rich food like leafy greens and oranges too. Mixed with these drugs, these foods can cause high potassium levels.When consumed in excess, it can also cause irregular heartbeats and palpitations. It's best to inform your GP if you're taking potassium or diuretics alongside blood pressure medication. ALCOHOL Avoid if you take -Antihistamines, diabetes medicines or painkillers Medicines often come with a warning to avoid alcohol. This is due to the pressure booze puts on your liver. Alcohol, paracetamol and codeine are metabolised by the liver and it will have to work harder to break down alcohol and medications at the same time. This can increase the risk of side effects from the medications, including drowsiness. Also, overworking your liver can eventually increase your risk of liver damage. LEAFY GREENS Avoid if you take -Anticoagulants Leafy greens are part of a healthy diet but when you're taking antiblood-clotting medicines, like Warfarin, you need to be careful not to suddenly up your leafy green intake. They are high in vitamin K and as a result, help blood to clot. Warfarin is designed to prevent the production of vitamin K so if you suddenly eat more greens, this will interfere with the medicine. BLACK LIQUORICE Avoid if you take -Heart medications Liquorice lowers potassium in your body, which can be dangerous for those with certain heart conditions. Low levels of potassium can increase side effects associated with digoxin, used to treat congestive heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms. . . Diuretics to treat high blood pressure, glaucoma, heart failure and liver and kidney problems, also lower potassium, so taken with liquorice they cause levels to fall. This causes weakness, cramps and irregular heart rhythms. GRAPEFRUIT Avoid if you take -Statins If you are taking statins to lower blood pressure, then grapefruit, or its juice, won't provide a healthy breakfast. Grapefruit contains a chemical that stops the body breaking down statins. This will lead to raised levels in your body which means you will be at risk of side-effects. Patients might experience muscle aches and pains as a result. MILK Avoid if you take -Antibiotics Ciprofloxacin and tetracycline should be taken with a glass of water one hour before a meal or two hours after you have eaten.Food will interfere with the way these medications are absorbed by your body and dairy products, such as milk, will have the same effect. So while it might be tempting to take antibiotics with a glass of milk, don't. LIMES Avoid if you take -Cough medicines. Be careful with limes or Seville oranges if you're taking cough medicines with dextromethorphan. Citrus foods can interfere with the process that breaks down the drug causing more of it to get in your body. This can lead to side-effects like hallucinations or drowsiness. The fruits' effects can last for 24 hours or more, so avoid them while you need the cough medicine. SMOKED SALMON Avoid if you take -Antidepressants. Check with your GP if your antidepressants come under the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) category before you indulge in smoked meats such as salami, smoked salmon or chicken liver pate. The problem is that these foods are rich in tyramine, a compound caused by the breakdown of amino acid. When mixed with MAOIs, it can cause tyramine levels to spike leading to dangerously high blood pressure.Other foods on the risk list include strong or aged cheese and other smoked or processed meats and fish.",0

Obama to Skip Nancy Reagan's Funeral to Attend South by Southwest - NBC News President Obama will not attend Nancy Reagan's funeral on Friday, opting instead to speak at a festival in Austin, Texas. South by Southwest ? an annual music, tech, and film gathering ? announced last week that Obama would be the keynote speaker on March 11, and that Michelle Obama was scheduled to speak on March 16. It's the first time in the festival's 30-year history that a sitting president and first lady have participated. Michelle Obama will be at the former first lady's funeral, which will be held at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. But White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest confirmed Tuesday that President Obama won't be there. ""The president will not attend,"" he said at the daily White House briefing. ""The president is traveling in Texas."" Reagan, 94, died Saturday of congestive heart failure. She will be buried beside her husband, former President Ronald Reagan. This isn't the first notable funeral in recent weeks that Obama has missed: Last month, Obama skipped Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's funeral, choosing to paying his respects the day before while Scalia's body lay in repose. Vice President Joe Biden was at the funeral itself. In a statement after her death, the Obamas said they were ""grateful"" for Nancy Reagan's life. ""Nancy Reagan once wrote that nothing could prepare you for living in the White House. She was right, of course. But we had a head start, because we were fortunate to benefit from her proud example, and her warm and generous advice,"" they said. Presidents do not always attend former first ladies' funerals, although current and former first ladies usually do. When Betty Ford died in 2011, neither Obama nor former President Bill Clinton went to her funeral. Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and former first lady Rosalynn Carter did; former President George W. Bush was also there, accompanied by Nancy Reagan.",0

Having more muscle and less fat reduces the risk of early death in people with heart disease, a new study suggests. Doctors should encourage patients to do resistance exercises as part of a healthy lifestyle, rather than emphasizing and monitoring weight loss, the study authors advised. For the study, Dr. Preethi Srikanthan of the University of California, Los Angeles, and colleagues analyzed data gathered from more than 6,400 Americans with heart disease. The investigators found that people with higher amounts of muscle and lower levels of body fat were less likely to die of heart problems or any other causes than those in three other groups based on body composition. The groups were: low muscle/high fat; low muscle/low fat; or high muscle/high fat. Because people with more muscle were more likely to have a high body mass index (BMI, a measurement based on height and weight), the findings could explain what?s called the ?obesity paradox,? where people with a higher BMI have lower death rates, the researchers suggested. The study results show the importance of maintaining muscle mass in order to reduce the risk of premature death, even in people with a higher heart risk, the study authors said in a university news release. According to the American College of Sports Medicine, resistance training ? also called strength training ? can be done with common household products, for example, milk jugs filled with sand. Or, people can use traditional free weights and dumbbells, weight machines, elastic tubing or medicine balls. But consult your doctor before starting any exercise program, the experts say. The findings were published this month in the American Journal of Cardiology. More information The American Academy of Family Physicians has more on heart failure.",0

This year we are on track to help over 30,000 diabetics achieve ""the impossible"". The diabetes breakthrough you are about to discover on this page is twice as effective as the leading type 2 drug at normalizing blood sugar, fixing insulin resistance, stopping neuropathy pain, preventing blindness, amputations and other diabetes problems. These techniques have been used successfully by tens of thousands of people in over 40 countries and have helped type 2 diabetics eliminate the need for drugs and insulin injections while helping type ones greatly reduce their drug and injection dosages. Countless studies from scientists and doctors all over the world have proven that people with type 2 diabetes can normalize blood sugar, increase insulin sensitivity, end neuropathy pain, lower risk of blindness, amputations and be taken off all diabetes drugs and insulin injections. Patients with type 1 diabetes are also able to greatly reduce drug and insulin dosages while lowering blood sugar. The cold hard truth: By living with diabetes and by taking your prescribed medication, you are under the constant daily threat of dying of a heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, succumbing to blindness, amputations, neuropathy, hypertension, nerve system disease, high cholesterol, depression, and falling into a coma. Those are just the side-effects of living with diabetes. Now lets add the side-effects from the drugs that are supposed to ""help"" you; hepatitis, liver problems, acidosis leading to death within hours, heart attacks, stroke, increased risk of cancer, weakened immune system, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, heart failure, etc. If you think it will ever get better, it won't. It has been scientifically proven that simply treating diabetes with conventional methods does not stop the disease. Over time, diabetics are prescribed higher and higher dosages of drugs. Then when those fail, they get prescribed insulin injections on top of drugs. It doesn't matter if you follow your doctors recommendations and dosages exactly as prescribed. This isn't a question of IF, but WHEN. Your health will get worse. The drugs you take will fail. The insulin injections you take will also fail. If you have diabetes, you simply cannot continue this way - sooner rather than later you WILL die; either from diabetes, its complications, or side-effects from the drugs you take. And it won't be quietly in your sleep either. Getting rushed to the hospital while the paramedics break all of your ribs giving you CPR will be hell on earth. Spending your last moments with tubes and pumps and ventilators in unbearable agony, you will wish you did something sooner. If you are OK with slowly losing your vision and then going blind as diabetes destroys the blood vessels in your eyes causing them to wither and die, if you're perfectly fine with dying 9 years earlier, possibly not waking up tomorrow, dropping dead at any moment or having your legs amputated. If you are OK with not seeing your kids or grandkids grow up, then please, close this page and go back to what you were doing. If on the other hand you're tired of the constant blood sugar readings, the tedious drug reigmens, constantly worrying about the health problems waiting for you in a few years. If you are tired of being lied to and are ready to finally learn the truth about this disease and find out how tens of thousands of type 2 diabetics completely reversed their diabetes, normalized their blood sugar and were taken off all drugs and injections, then read on. The Root Cause of Diabetes: It might be hard to believe, but when you prick your finger with a meter and see a blood sugar reading of let's say 250, it's NOT because you have diabetes! Some people can walk around with blood sugar as high as 300 without having diabetes. How is this possible? It all comes down to a single word: INFLAMMATION. Ever wondered why diabetics have such high rates of heart disease, heart attacks, cancer, high cholesterol, blindness, arthritis, and neuropathy? Inflammation. Just recently; February 2015, Scientists and researchers at the University of California San Diego proved that type 2 diabetes is caused by inflammation: they discovered that an inflammatory molecule called LTB4 causes insulin resistance. And what does insulin resistance lead to? high blood sugar and diabetes. This is the reason why treating your blood sugar with drugs and injecting insulin to combat insulin sensitivity will never heal your diabetes; because you aren't treating the root cause of diabetes, just the symptoms of it..

BanzaiToMyLife ^ I did fainted after hitting my head on the ground when I was 16 in a fight with a huge dude. I do hear that, but that does not proves there is no afterlife. The only when you are technically dead is when your heart stopped beating and oxygen support to your brain stops. If your heart started beating back rapidly, then it was too short for you experience anything or simply you forgot due to limitation of physical brain(dream from deep sleep) My heart stopped for 20 minutes. I had a lot of brain damage afterwards, I dont know how I managed to fix myself but I did in one month without any therapy. Some nurses kept my brain cold while I was in a coma by supplying it with ice. I think that helped a lot. I couldn't distinguish shapes, colors or actually understand what I was seeing, I couldn't walk and I couldn't speak but somehow I was fully aware of what was going on around me, sometimes even when I was in the coma. I was almost a vegetable but I still had my conscience left. After 2 weeks I read one book, about 600 pages in one week and I was up and functional, still a bit shabby, but I was pretty close to normal. Now I am even better than I was before the heart failure, starting to get a lot of energy which sometimes wears off pretty quick and it is not constant. There is no afterlife bro. This is all you've got, right here, right now so make sure you get the best of it. If you don't, well it still doesn't matter cuz you'll be dead anyway and no matter how great your deeds were, how much of a man you were and how many people fell at your feet and praised you, you will die anyway, your flesh will rot, your bones will turn to dust and you will be forgotten into the ashes of history.Scientifically speaking, when a person dies, they have intense celebral activity that activates their broka region. When you are medically dead, you must have saw something. You were just in a coma and you weren't dead. It's controversial if NDE has to do with amplified celebral activity of dying brain but it needs further explanation for cases when brain is no longer functioning and still has NDE.

This was determined based on two studies in patients with heart disease clinical trials, the result showed a higher number of hospitalizations in patients receiving these drugs versus placebo patients (1). Saxagliptin and alogliptin are indicated in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus since both are inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), thus slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP (glucagon-like peptide and gastric inhibitory peptide respectively), which stimulate insulin release from pancreatic cells, which regulates glucose homeostasis blood level (2,3). Importantly, in patients with type 2 diabetes, heart failure is a common complication, why it was vital to establish whether the use of therapeutic agents employed for this pathology, reduced or increased adverse effects risk of developing heart failure ( 4). Currently saxagliptin it has 5 existing health records in Colombia, while alogliptin 9. Both features are indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, in complement with diet and exercise. Heart failure is a possible adverse effect reported for saxagliptin, while speaking of fulminant hepatic failure to alogliptin (5). Based on the above, it is recommended that patients taking these drugs and heart failure also present, see a doctor to assess the possible suspension of such drugs. Patients who for any reason must leave the medication without consulting the doctor is highlighted. Additionally, if you have fatigue, weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath, unusual shortness of breath or weight gain, swollen ankles, feet, legs or stomach, you should immediately see a doctor and are encouraged to report such cases to National Pharmacovigilance program of the National Institute of Food and Drug Administration (INVIMA), line 2948700 ext. 3916, 3921, or 3847 or email invimafv@invima.gov, using the format FOREAM report.

Mrs Godfrey, who works in marketing, said: 'His tongue kept growing bigger and bigger. 'It got to the point where he could touch his nose without trying and his mouth was always in an open position because his tongue was so large. 'It was so long and wide that it was blocking his airways and could have been quite dangerous. 'He would gasp and choke while feeding and then while he slept I could hear him snore and stop breathing. It was quite a frightening time. His parents Holly 33, and Ben, 38, were terrified when they heard Rory choking while eating and stop breathing She added: 'His tongue was folding backwards into his mouth and because it was so long and wide it had no other place to go but to rest in his throat which as choking him. 'Every night I heard him struggle for air and was too scared to go to sleep in case I woke up to a blue baby who had died during the night.' Rory's oversized tongue also meant his jaw was starting to widen and deform. During the operation doctors sliced a large chunk of his tongue off in a 'W'-shaped cut before stitching it back together. His mother said: 'He was still very swollen at the time, but now he can smile perfectly and put his tongue inside his mouth for the first time. 'He's so happy now, he's more vocal than he was before and has definitely compensated for the sounds he couldn't make before. 'Back then he would try to make an ""m"" sound but could never say mama. Now he can and it's pretty amazing, it's really sweet seeing him progress so much. 'We've been on quite the rollercoaster but now hopefully we are out the other end of it.' Two months ago he went for reduction surgery to slice off part of his tongue and his life has been transformed Rory was diagnosed with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome at three months old, after his mother pushed doctors to ascertain why her baby was struggling to breathe and his tongue was continuing to grow. Mrs Godfrey added: 'As soon as I heard him choke and gasp for air I knew something was horribly wrong, but was reassured he was fine. 'I kept pushing for more tests to be done and eventually we were referred to a geneticist, where he was diagnosed with BWS. I suppose it was just mother's intuition.' Tricia Surley, of the support group How Big BWS, said: 'The condition can cause the tongue, tonsils and adenoids to grow much larger than a normal child and create airway restrictions. 'Approximately 90 per cent of children have an enlarged tongue that can lead to moderate to severe breathing, feeding and speech problems. 'Many children with BWS are diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnoea. 'If it is graded moderate to severe, most physicians will look at surgical interventions to help free up space in the airway.' For more information or support visit www.howbigbws.com ONE IN 14,000 BORN WITH THE RARE GENETIC OVERGROWTH DISORDER Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a congenital overgrowth disorder, which can affect all parts of the body. BWS is a rare genetic condition, affecting around one in every 15,000 births worldwide. The figure is likely to be higher in reality, with mild cases rarely diagnosed. Cases have been reported in most developed countries, and in the majority of cases it appears to be an isolated case with no known relatives suffering the disorder. In some cases there is evidence the condition can be inherited. Children with BWS are often born prematurely but are larger and heavier than expected, given their early arrival. Typically a child born with BWS will have an enlarged tongue, which can causes breathing, feeding and speaking difficulties, as well as excessive dribbling. It can also cause respiratory problems and result in a protruding lower jaw. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Children with the condition are also likely to suffer enlarged abdominal organs, overgrowth of one half of the body, liver tumours and an enlarged heart or heart defects. BWS is diagnosed genetically in 80 per cent of cases, with the remainder being diagnosed after a clinical examination.",0

An eating disorder should not be taken lightly, it is not just a fad or phase that can be easily ?cured?. These are complex and harmful conditions that cause strain on health, relationships, and productivity. Since these conditions pose serious consequences, it is important that anyone who is struggling with an eating disorder seek professional help in order to begin their road to recovery. The first step toward recovery is identifying the problem. Below we breakdown three of the most prevalent eating disorders affecting millions of Americans each year. Please take a few minutes to review and learn how these disorders affect the sufferer. Anorexia Nervosa Anorexia Nervosa is a cycle of self-starvation where those who suffer from it constantly deny their bodies of essential nutrients it needs to function. Because of this, the body slows down significantly slowing down all of its processes to conserve energy, which results in serious medical consequences such as: Reduction of bone density which results in frail and brittle bones Muscle loss and weakness Abnormally slow heart rate and blood pressure. This results in the flux in the heart muscles and patients risk heart failure. Severe dehydration which leads to kidney failure Chronic fatigue and weakness which can cause fainting and dizziness Dry hair and skin On occasion, the body will grow a downy layer of skin known as lanugo in order to keep the body warm due to depravation of nutrients Bulimia Nervosa Unlike anorexia nervosa where the body is constantly denying itself of nutrients, bulimia nervosa is a chronic binging and purging cycle that can be harmful to the entire digestive system causing electrolyte and chemical imbalance. This can lead to complications that affect the heart and other vital organs. Some consequences of bulimia include: Inflammation and possible rupturing of the esophagus from frequent vomiting Tooth decay from stomach acids Irregular bowel movements due and constipation due to possible abuse of laxatives Electrolyte imbalance that can cause irregular heartbeats and lead to heart failure or death. Stomach ulcers and pancreatitis Binge Eating Disorders Eating disorders are not exclusive to under-eating and nutrient deprivation. They can go both ways and binge eating disorder is characterized by consuming an abnormally large amount of food in a short period to time associated with a loss of control during these episodes. Bing eating disorder includes several of the same consequences as obesity including: High cholesterol and blood pressure Heart disease due to elevated triglyceride levels Type II diabetes Gallbladder disease The post An Eating Disorder Can Be Life Threating appeared first on .",0

February 26, 2016 ? Vascular thrombosis is one of the conditions that is thought to be caused by physical inactivity. Individuals who live a sedentary lifestyle are thought to be more susceptible to experiencing an impediment in their circulation, which eventually leads to heart failure. There is a wide variety of medications available, but there are also natural remedies believed to be helpful for the condition. Experts investigate the anti-thrombotic properties of turmeric. Turmeric is one of the oldest, medicinal spices that are widely used nowadays. It is believed to offer a myriad of health benefits. Its phytochemical called curcumin is believed to prevent and reverse certain types of diseases. Vascular thrombosis develops when clot or thrombus formation causes an impediment in the blood flow in the veins or arteries. This condition is affecting an increasing number of people from around the world. Turmeric has anti-thrombotic properties, which are thought to inhibit blood clots. These anti-thrombotic properties of the spice are believed to be extremely helpful for individuals who suffer from vascular thrombosis. The Biochemical Pharmacology featured a study in 1999. In 2005, the Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology also published a study. These studies reveal that curcumin has the potential ability to decrease the risk of clogged arteries, strokes, and heart attacks. In 2009, the USDA started the ongoing study that demonstrated the same findings. The speakers in the 2010 American Heart Association Stroke Conference reiterated that the use of turmeric may be made even more efficient by using a bioavailability-enhancing ingredient. Turmeric has low bioavailability, and this means that the absorption of its nutrients inside the body is limited. It can be made even more effective when combined with a bioavailability-enhancing ingredient. Bioavailability-enhancing ingredients include a black pepper extract called BioPerine. The anti-thrombosis properties of turmeric can be efficiently delivered when the spice is taken with a bioavailability enhancing ingredient. These therapeutic properties could be more effective then in dissolving blood clots. What makes turmeric even more beneficial is that its use is not associated with side effects. There are quite a number of pharmaceutical drugs nowadays that are formulated to prevent blood clots. However, their use has been linked with breathing difficulties, back pain, headaches, hemorrhage, and excessive bleeding. The most recommended turmeric supplements are those that contain a black pepper extract called BioPerine. These supplements are believed to be more effective due to the combination of the two therapeutic ingredients (amazon.com/Turmeric-Curcumin-BioPerine-Pepper-Extract/dp/B00VSVKJ8I). About Divine Bounty: Divine Bounty is a family-owned brand that manufactures high-quality turmeric curcumin supplements. Passionate about the potential health benefits of turmeric, the team behind Divine Bounty have carefully researched and sourced only the best ingredients to create the ideal blend of turmeric curcumin.

According to data available to the agency saxagliptin it could be associated with increased rates of death from any cause (MCC). These conclusions came from reanalysis SAVOR-TIMI 53 (Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus) study of 16,492 patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2) which showed that the saxogliptina was not inferior to placebo in production cardiovascular events (CVD) in patients at high cardiovascular risk, but there were more admissions for heart failure (HF) (3.5% vs. 2.8%; HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.07 -1.51; P = 0.007). Or, what it is the same, 35 of 1000 patients saxagliptin 1000 versus 28 in the placebo group, point out in the final document. On the other hand, as we have seen in other post, the Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes With Alogliptin versus Standard of Care (EXAMINE) with alogliptin in individuals who had suffered recent acute coronary syndrome showed a HR of 0.96 (upper limit of the IC 95%, 1,16 P less than 0.001 for noninferiority) for the primary endpoint of non-inferiority of CVD. In this trial, although initially the risk of IC was in question, this further FDA review indicates that 3.9% of those receiving alogliptin were admitted for heart failure compared with 3.3% in the placebo group. Or what is the same, 39 of 1,000 patients compared to 33 in 1000 in the placebo group, punctuate. Little, but apparently enough for this organism. A further communication of this organization dated yesterday (05-04-2016), and updating of earlier (11.02.2014), warns again about adding these warnings in the labeling on the prospects of this substance in relation to this adverse effect , especially in patients with heart or kidney disease. This body recommended to stop medication containing saxagliptin or alogliptin fruit of those patients who develop their antidiabetic therapy HF. In these cases better use other antidiabetic drugs. ** U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

For background I'm a 4th year medical student sitting in a cardiologists office. I'll elaborate on what u/chewylewisandthenews said: First off is to realize how conduction in the heart works. It is a very complex system but I will attempt to simplify. An impulse is generated in the SA node by special cells, that automatically polarize and depolarize at a certain rate. This signal is sent from the SA node --> atria --> AV node --> purkinje fibers --> ventricles. Epinephrine and norepinephrine can modulate this automaticity by binding B1 receptors, in addition the AV node (between the atria and ventricles) has adrenergic receptors, which will allow the time that the is needed to conduct an impulse through the AV node to be decreased (faster repolarization). With these two basic principles we can move forward. The way that BBs work is by competing with adrenaline for a spot on the receptor. When adrenaline is bound HR increases, when less adrenaline is bound HR decreases. If you are strictly talking about cardiac receptors, then if you expose the patient to the BB, their heart rate will decrease, because it is blocking the adrenaline from binding the receptors, but keep in mind there are thousands and thousands of receptors and not all are going to be blocked, only a portion, so the others can be bound by adrenaline. So net effect the heart rate will decrease. When you exercise, your body releases more adrenaline (think fight or flight) and thus the proportion of BB to adrenaline decreases, so more adrenaline is binding to the receptor. This will cause your HR to be elevated from baseline; however, your HR could potentially be higher w/o the BB (depending on how high it is). For this reason, your body is not able to appropriately deal with your muscles increased O2 demand and you will get decreased exercise tolerance (very common side effect), can get lactic acidosis (due to increased anaerobic activity) in addition to increased soreness post exercise. There are more than one type of beta blocker. Some are cardioselective (e.g. atenolol) and these exhibit the majority of the action on the B1 receptor. Then there are other types that are non-selective (propanolol), B2 selective (albuterol) that are used for all sorts of diseases.When giving a beta blocker for heart failure, after a heart attack, or atrial fibrillation, the reasoning is not always the same. For atrial fibrillation for example, the electrical impulses that are being sent from the atria to the ventricles are being generated in an abnormal pattern somewhere in the atria and conducted through the AV node to the ventricles. The cardioselective BBs slow the conduction of the impulse through the AV node, allowing the atria to essentially send more blood into the ventricles prior to it being pumped into the aorta. I'm not sure if by sit up you mean standing from sitting or doing sit ups. But either way BBs can cause you to lose consciousness if you are elderly and try to stand too quickly due to decreased perfusion of the brain (orthostatic hypotension) and is a common reason to take select patients off of BBs. I know this is a long response, but I hope it helped!",0

PAUL, Minn.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE:STJ), a global medical device company, today announced CE Mark approval and launch of three new Quartet? left ventricular (LV) leads , offering additional electrode spacing options and one new lead shape. The additional spacing combinations are aimed to more effectively target the individual cardiac anatomies of patients who need support from cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers (CRT-P) and defibrillators (CRT-D). ?The expanded selection of quadripolar pacing leads reinforces St. Jude Medical?s leadership in quadripolar pacing and heart failure treatment options.? ?Heart and blood vessel anatomy vary from patient to patient so having multiple sizes and spacing options with the Quartet quadripolar lead helps me to treat all of my patients in need of cardiac resynchronization therapy. We are now able to place the quadripolar lead in the best possible location for that patient, capturing more cardiac tissue to give heart failure patients the best opportunity to respond,? said Dr. Sami Pakarinen, a cardiologist from Helsinki University Central Hospital in Finland. Studies have shown that CRT can improve the quality of life for many patients with heart failure. CRT resynchronizes the beating of the heart's lower chambers (ventricles), which often beat out of sync in heart failure patients. The addition of MultiPoint Pacing ? technology enables physicians to program a single Quartet LV lead to pace multiple sites on the left side of the heart, giving the clinician more choices to improve patient response to therapy and reducing the likelihood of costly and invasive lead revision through a second intervention procedure. ?These lead choices allow physicians to identify what lead spacing option will work best for each patient so they can individualize care,? said Philip B. Adamson, M.D., medical director and vice president of medical affairs at St. Jude Medical. ?The expanded selection of quadripolar pacing leads reinforces St. Jude Medical?s leadership in quadripolar pacing and heart failure treatment options.? The newly-approved additional quadripolar lead options are used with next-generation MultiPoint Pacing technology, which enables physicians to pace multiple locations on the left side of the heart and provide physicians a new option for patients who haven?t responded to CRT. The expanded selection of quadripolar pacing leads makes the St. Jude Medical quadripolar lead portfolio the broadest on the market and allows for enhanced individualization of CRT. The new leads are designed based on the company?s first-to-market proven quadripolar LV lead technology and include additional spacing options on two new S-shape and one new double-bend lead designs. Some of the newly approved products are also magnetic resonance (MR) ? conditional, including the Quadra Assura ? CRT-D and Quadra Assura MP ? CRT-D with MultiPoint ? Pacing . Additionally, physicians will be able to quickly customize therapy using the Auto VectSelect Quartet ? Test, which is designed to automatically guide programming of the most appropriate therapy options available and streamline workflow. About Heart Failure More than five million Americans and about 26 million people worldwide suffer from heart failure, which occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the body. When this happens, blood pressure eventually rises, leading to shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling and other symptoms. Cardiac resynchronization therapy is a treatment option for symptomatic heart failure. Quadripolar Pacing Technology from St. Jude Medical St. Jude Medical introduced the industry?s first quadripolar pacing system featuring four pacing electrodes. The quadripolar pacing system offers physicians the ability to effectively and efficiently manage the ever-changing needs of patients with heart failure. The system integrates multiple pacing configurations and TailoredTherapy? features that enable physicians to optimize the system at implant and follow-up, as well as better manage common pacing complications without having to surgically reposition the lead. The Quartet lead design allows the physician to implant the lead in the most stable position without making trade-offs in electrical performance. This includes pacing closer to the base of the left ventricle, which studies associate with better patient outcomes and which may be more difficult with traditional bipolar leads. The quadripolar pacing electrodes also provide physicians more options to optimize CRT performance, such as pacing around scar tissue in the heart and avoiding the most common pacing complications. The MORE-CRT prospective, randomized clinical trial of more than 1,500 patients demonstrated a 40 percent relative risk reduction of lead-related complications for patients implanted with the Quartet LV lead. To date, more than 130 clinical publications have provided broad clinical evidence supporting the advantages of quadripolar technology from St. Jude Medical.

Cold Showers Losing weight can be a tiring and self-deprecating journey that seems to stretch on for months on end. Wouldn?t it be wonderful if losing weight was as simple as walking into the bathroom and having a cold shower? As incredible as it may sound, it does work! A cold shower does promote weight loss! How? The ?James Bond Shower,? which essentially involves turning the water temperature down to cold, helps you burn fat. Read our post and learn how cold shower benefits weight loss. Cold Showers For Weight Loss We know you still can?t digest the fact. But cold showers do help promote weight loss in many different ways. Our body typically consists of two kinds of fat, white fat and brown fat. White fat is the unwanted fat that accumulates when you eat excessively and supply your body with more calories than it needs, and your body can?t burn these excess calories. White fat piles up in your waist, lower back, neck, thighs and glutes, and are the fact that most of us struggle to eliminate from the body. Brown fat, on the other hand, is the good fat that generates heat to keep our bodies warm. When you feel cold, brown fat activity increases. Cold showers help promote brown fat activity, which in turn means that you are burning fat while you shower. Brown fat generates heat in your body. However, BAT (Brown Adipose Tissue) is normally inactive, as long as you are working or relaxing in your body?s thermal comfort zone. BAT is common in adults and has a high likelihood of existing in women and leaner individuals. When you get into a cold shower, the BAT activates and generates heat. The heat quickens up your metabolism and helps you burn white fat. Studies conclude that exposure to extremely cold temperature helps activate brown fat in 23 and 24 participants by a 15-fold increase. It means that if you shower with cold water every day, you could be looking at a weight loss of around nine pounds every year. Benefits Of Cold Showers So, you know how cold showers help you burn fat. You might wonder what other benefits getting into a cold shower include! Well, cold showers: 1. Improve Circulation Showering with cold water encourages blood circulation, and when the blood surrounds our organs, it helps combat some problems of the skin and heart. As cold water hits your body, it boosts blood circulation, and the arteries pump blood more efficiently, which boosts your heart health. Showering with cold water also boosts organ health and enhances your immunity. 2. Relieves Stress A cold shower not only helps burn fat and boosts your heart health, but it is also good for your head. A cold shower helps you get rid of anxiety, and regular cold showers can also help you adapt to repetitive oxidative stress. 3. Cures Depression Cold water showers can help you overcome depression. Cold water interacts with your skin?s cold receptors, which stimulate your brain by sending electrical impulses. The electrical impulses trigger an anti-depressive effect, which helps treat depression. 4. Makes You Alert A cold shower in the morning will get you up and running. It may seem like a horrifyingly chilly idea, but don?t worry. Your BATs will help keep you warm. As you feel cold, your oxygen intake increases, which provide your body energy for the day and make you feel alert. Side Effects of Cold Showers (Long, Ice-Cold Showers) ? Hypothermia Taking lengthy cold showers could be dangerous, because it may put you at risk of hypothermia. You can develop hypothermia in just a few minutes through exposure to icy water. Taking long; frigid showers could make your body temperature drop to dangerously low levels. After going in the state of Hypothermia, your reflexes could slow down, and cause muscle weakness and induce fatigue. This could also increase your risk of falling in the shower and sustaining an injury. Because of continuous dropping body temperature, hypothermia negatively affects heart function, and it may induce deadly heart failure. Select The Safer Way to Weight Loss The best way to lose weight is still the old-fashioned way, which is eating less and moving more. If you eat 500 calories less than you burn daily allow you to lose 1 pound each week.",0

But the treatment also comes with side effects, including the risk of ulcers and increased blood pressure. A major new study now gathers all research in the area. This shows that arthritis medicine is particularly dangerous for heart patients, and also that older types of arthritis medicine, which have not previously been in focus, also appear to be dangerous for the heart. ?It?s been well-known for a number of years that newer types of NSAIDs ? what are known as COX-2 inhibitors, increase the risk of heart attacks. For this reason, a number of these newer types of NSAIDs have been taken off the market again. We can now see that some of the older NSAID types, particularly Diclofenac, are also associated with an increased risk of heart attack and apparently to the same extent as several of the types that were taken off the market,? says Morten Schmidt, MD and PhD from Aarhus University, who is in charge of the research project. He adds: ?This is worrying, because these older types of medicine are frequently used throughout the western world and in many countries available without prescription.? Each year, more than 15 per cent of the western countries collects a prescription for NSAIDs. This figure increases with age. Sixty per cent of the adult population in Denmark collects at least one prescription for an NSAID within a ten-year period. Heart patients are no exception and previous studies have shown that up to forty per cent of Danish patients with heart failure or previous heart attacks are prescribed NSAIDs. The study, which was carried out in collaboration between 14 European universities and hospitals, including a number of leading European heart specialists, is today being published in the most prestigious European journal of heart medicine, European Heart Journal . New guidelines In the study, the researchers have gathered all research on the use of NSAIDs in patients with heart disease. The survey means that the European Society of Cardiology has now for the first time formulated a number of recommendations about what doctors should consider before prescribing painkillers to their patients. ?When doctors issue prescriptions for NSAIDs, they must in each individual case carry out a thorough assessment of the risk of heart complications and bleeding. NSAIDs should only be sold over the counter when it comes with an adequate warning about the associated cardiovascular risks. In general, NSAIDs are not be used in patients who have or are at high-risk of cardiovascular diseases,? says another of the authors, Professor in cardiology Christian Torp-Pedersen, Aalborg University, Denmark. Consumption should be reduced even more For a number of years, Danish researchers have made significant contributions in the field. One result of this work has been a reduction in the use of Diclofenac in Denmark. However, according to Morten Schmidt, there is still room for improvement: ?Many European countries consume more of these drugs than Denmark. But we can still do better and it?s often the case that paracetamol, physiotherapy, mild opioids or other types of NSAIDs with less risk for the heart would be better for the patients. Of course, the recommendations that have been introduced following our study and its review of the heart-related risks are a big step in the right direction in relation to patient safety,? says Morten Schmidt. FACTS about arthritis medicine (NSAID): NSAIDs is an abbreviation for Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and is used to treat a wide range of diseases, in particular disorders in the muscular and bone system, where the drug counteracts swelling, pain and limitations in movement associated with inflammation. NSAIDs are not antibiotics and therefore do not help to fight infections caused by bacteria. NSAIDs are in Denmark sold both in low doses (Ibuprofen 200 mg/tablet) without a prescription and in higher doses and other types with a prescription. ### Read the scientific article: http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/09/27/eurheartj.ehv505 Contact information Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital, Department of Clinical Epidemiology London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology Telephone: (+44) 7469799789",0

In a black with heart failure, we'd be looking at an ACEi/ARB first, followed by a beta-blocker (bisoprolol, metoprolol-XR, carvedilol, or nebivolol, only), followed by spironolactone, followed by hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate. I'm over-simplifying the HF Tx scheme for the sake of this thread, but the two points I want to make are 1) blacks benefit from afterload reduction (so in the absence of HF it makes no sense to choose a thiazide over a dCCB), and 2) hydralazine + isosorbide dinitrate, as a combination, yields extra mortality benefit in this group, in the setting of heart failure.",0

This amino acid is essential for many different muscle, cognitive and metabolic functions. It helps break down and transport nutrients like glycogen and fat to be used by cells for energy, and in the process, it supports strong immune, digestive and nervous systems. In the human body, glycine is found in high concentrations in the skin, connective tissues of the joints and muscle tissue. One of the key amino acids used to form collagen and gelatin, glycine can be found in bone broth and other protein sources. In fact, glycine (along with many other nutrients like proline and arginine) is part of what gives ?superfood? bone broth its amazing healing abilities. Glycine Benefits & Uses According to research done by the Departments of Cell and Developmental Biology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, glycine can be used to help lower symptoms in people suffering from conditions like ulcers, arthritis, leaky gut syndrome, diabetes, kidney and heart failure, neurobehavioral disorders, chronic fatigue, sleep disorders, and even certain cancers. (1) Amino acids such as glycine can be found in supplement form, but it?s easy ? and probably even more beneficial ? to acquire them from natural food sources. Some of the many health benefits of glycine include: helping build lean muscle mass preventing scaropenia (muscle loss, muscle wasting or deterioration) playing a role in the production of human growth hormone boosting mental performance and memory helping prevent strokes and seizures protecting skin from signs of aging or cellular mutations protecting collagen in joints and reducing joint pain improving flexibility and range of motion stabilizing blood sugar and lowering risk for type 2 diabetes improving sleep quality lowering inflammation and free radical damage by increasing glutathione production reducing risk for certain types of cancer building the lining of the gastrointestinal tract producing bile salts and digestive enzymes helping reduce allergic and autoimmune reactions boosting energy levels and fighting fatigue helping produce red blood cells fighting the effects of stress and anxiety helping control symptoms of seizures, schizophrenia and mental disorders Among all of these benefits, here are several key ways glycine is used in the body: 1. Promotes Muscle Growth Glycine has been found to help inhibit the deterioration of valuable protein tissue that forms muscle and boosts muscle recovery. In fact, it?s known as an ?anti-aging amino acid? because of how it helps maintain lean muscle mass into old age, stimulates the secretion of human growth hormone, prevents loss of cartilage in joints, and even improves daytime energy, physical performance and mental capabilities (all important for athletes). (2, 3) Glycine is used during the biosynthesis of creatine, which provides muscles with a direct source of fuel to repair damage and grow back stronger. It also helps provide cells with energy thanks to its role in the conversion of nutrients from your diet, helping feed hungry muscle tissues and boosting endurance, strength and performance. It also has benefits when it comes to hormone production and regulation, helping the body naturally synthesize steroid hormones that regulate the ratio of fat to muscle mass and control energy expenditure. (4) 2. Repairs and Protects Joints and Cartilage Together with other amino acids found in bone broth (especially proline), glycine plays a part in the formation of collagen, promoting the growth and function of joints, tendons and ligaments. Approximately one-third of collagen is composed of glycine, and collagen is crucial for forming connective tissue that keeps joints flexible and able to withstand shock. This is why collagen hydrolysate is often used for the treatment of degenerative joint diseases like osteoarthritis. (5) As people get older, it?s especially important to consume enough proteins (amino acids) in order to repair damaged tissues within joints that suffer due to ongoing free radical damage. Glycine is essential for the formation of stretchy, flexible cartilage, helps heal damaged joints, and can prevent loss of mobility and functionality in older adults. (6) 3. Improves Digestion Amino acids, including glycine and proline, help rebuild tissue that lines the digestive tract, keeping food particles and bacteria inside the gut where they belong, rather than allowing tiny openings to form that pass particles to the bloodstream where they trigger inflammation. Glycine helps form two of the most important substances that make up the gut lining: collagen and gelatin. Collagen and gelatine help people with food allergies and sensitivities tolerate foods more easily, can soothe the lining of the GI tract in people with inflammatory bowel diseases or indigestion (including leaky gut syndrome, IBS, Crohn?s, ulcerative colitis and acid reflux), and even promote probiotic balance and growth. Within the GI tract, glycine also acts like a metabolic fuel. It?s needed to manufacture bile, nucleic acids, creatine phosphate and porphyrins to be used to break down nutrients from your diet. For example, it helps break down fats by aiding with the production of bile acids and helps transport glycogen to cells to be used for energy in the form of ATP. Evidence also shows that glycine can help stabilize blood sugar levels, leading to more lasting energy and preventing sugar cravings and fatigue. 4. Slows the Effects of Aging and Builds the Immune System Glycine helps form glutathione, a valuable antioxidant that?s used to prevent cellular damage and various signs of aging. A 2011 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that although glutathione deficiency in elderly people occurs because of a marked reduction in synthesis, supplementation with the glutathione precursors cysteine and glycine fully restores glutathione synthesis. This helps increase concentrations and lowers levels of oxidative stress and oxidant damages that lead to aging. (7) In certain studies, glycine has even been found to help prevent cellular mutations that lead to cancer. There?s some evidence that using targeted amino acid therapy can prevent the growth of cancerous cells by cutting off their energy supply and help turn down inflammation, which is linked to numerous other chronic conditions besides cancer. 5. Calms the Nerves and Feeds the Brain Glycine is beneficial for supporting cognitive performance and the central nervous system because of how it helps regulate the metabolic synthesis of certain nutrients that the brain and nerves use for energy. It helps regulate nerve impulses throughout the body by balancing electrolyte levels, such as calcium, chloride and potassium. Due to its role in both nerve and neurotransmitter functions, glycine also has implications for helping improve sleep, mental performance, bodily sensations, moods, memory and behaviors. For example, glycine works with other amino acids, including taurine and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Some evidence shows that glycine can help reduce hyperactivity in the brain and even play a role in the treatment or prevention of mental disorders, including learning disabilities, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder/manic depression and epilepsy. Certain studies have shown that glycine helps reduce psychotic symptoms, strokes and seizures when used with other supplements as part of a holistic treatment plan for mental/cognitive illness. (8) 6. Fights Fatigue and Promotes Restful Sleep Due to its roles in the central nervous system and the digestive system, glycine can help boost energy levels, balance blood sugar and prevent fatigue. It can even be used to calm anxiety or nervousness that keeps you up at night and gets in the way of getting good sleep ? plus it helps directly bring nutrients to cells and tissue for energy at all times of the day. According to research done by the Japanese Society of Sleep Research, glycine supplements improve sleep quality, lessen daytime sleepiness and improve performance of memory recognition tasks. (9) One of its most important functions is helping carry out the biosynthesis of heme, a component of haemoglobin that helps produce and maintain red blood cells. (10) Red blood cells help carry oxygen around the body, support cellular functions, and provide the tissue, heart and brain with energy. In fact, glycine is often used in supplements meant to improve energy in athletes, fight fatigue caused by anemia and help regulate blood sugar levels. What Is Glycine? Classified as a ?non-essential? (also called conditional) amino acid, glycine can be made in small amounts by the human body itself, but many people can benefit from consuming a lot more from their diets thanks to its numerous beneficial roles. Nutritional Information and Facts About Glycine: Glycine is the second most widespread amino acid found in human enzymes and proteins, which is why it has roles in nearly every part of the body. (11) It?s one of 20 amino acids used to make protein in the body, which builds the tissue that forms organs, joints and muscles. Of the proteins in the body, it?s concentrated in collagen (the most abundant protein in humans and many mammals) and also gelatin (a substance made from collagen). Some of the most attractive attributes include promoting better muscle growth, healing the lining of the GI tract, and slowing down the loss of cartilage in joints and skin. While high-protein foods (like meat and dairy products) do contain some glycine, the best sources ? collagen and gelatin ? can be hard to get. These proteins are not found in most cuts of meat and instead are obtained from consuming parts of animals that today most people throw away: skin, bones, connective tissue, tendons and ligaments. People who are ill, recovering from surgery, taking medications that hinder certain metabolic processes or who are under a lot of stress can all use extra glycine for recovery. Glycine Recipes & Supplements Getting more glycine into your diet is probably even easier than you think. Bone broth is a great source of naturally occurring glycine and other amino acids, is inexpensive, simple to make at home, and has far-reaching health benefits. Bone broth ? which is made from slowly simmering animal parts, including bones, skin and tendons, in stock ? contains natural collagen, which releases important amino acids and other substances that are often missing from the typical Western diet. However, if you?re not willing to consume bone broth ? for example, you?re a vegetarian or vegan ? glycine can be obtained from plant foods too. Plant-based sources include beans; vegetables like spinach, kale, cauliflower, cabbage and pumpkin; plus fruits like banana and kiwi. Other than bone broth, glycine can also be found in ?complete sources of proteins? (animal proteins), including meat, dairy products, poultry, eggs and fish. Don?t forget that glycine is also found in high amounts in gelatin, a substance made from collagen that?s used in certain food products and sometimes for cooking or food prep. Gelatin isn?t commonly eaten in large amounts but can be added to recipes when making some gelatin desserts, yogurts, raw cheeses or even ice cream. Here are several simple recipes you can make at home to boost your glycine intake: Homemade Chicken Bone Broth Recipe Homemade Beef Bone Broth Recipe Kale Chips Recipe Cauliflower Pizza Crust Recipe Turkey Chili with Adzuki Beans Recipe When it comes to glycine supplements and dosage recommendations, here?s what you need to know: While some foods (especially animal proteins and bone broth) do provide some glycine, amounts tend to be small overall so you need to consume supplements if you want to obtain a higher dose. There is no established daily requirement or upper limit of glycine at this time. It?s believed that most people already get around two grams of glycine daily from their diets, but needs differ a lot depending on someone?s level of activity and state of health. (12) Depending on the symptoms you?re looking to resolve, you might benefit from consuming 10 times the average amount or even more. Not all protein/amino acid supplements are created equal; always look for high-quality brands sold from reputable companies, and consume food-based supplements whenever possible. Because glycine is a natural amino acid, there?s not much risk for consuming too much from your diet. In supplement form, higher doses of glycine between 15?60 grams have been used safely to help resolve chronic conditions like mental disorders, but this amount should be taken with supervision from a doctor. It?s not known if giving glycine supplements to children, pregnant or breast-feeding women ? or people with kidney or liver disease ? is safe or a good idea, so avoid using glycine in these cases for now. Glycine supplements can also interact with certain medications when taken in high doses (such as those used by people with mental disorders, including clozapine). Although for most people glycine is very safe (especially in food form), if you take medications it?s always a good idea to get your doctor?s opinion when you begin to use any supplements. Final Thoughts on Glycine Glycine is a conditional/non-essential amino acid found in bone broth, meat, poultry, eggs, dairy products and certain beans and veggies. It helps form collagen and gelatin, substances that are important for building connective tissue throughout the body. Glycine is beneficial in both food and supplement form for people with joint pain, digestive disorders (like IBS, IBD or food sensitives), fatigue, trouble sleeping, anxiety and low immunity. There is no recommended daily amount of glycine or upper limit, and studies have found that it can be used safely in high doses up to 15?60 grams daily when necessary. However, estimates show that most people eating a standard Western diet consume only about two grams of glycine from their diets daily, most likely because concentrated sources like animal tendons, skins and bones are often thrown out.

BLOG,http://alizul2.blogspot.com,http://alizul2.blogspot.com/2016/04/10-inventions-creators-never-lived-to.html,4/13/2016,5:35:00,4/13/2016 15:05,10 INVENTIONS THE CREATORS NEVER LIVED TO SEE,"10 Inventions the Creators Never Lived to See By Emilios Manolidis, Toptenz, 13 April 2016. Throughout history, the works of inventors, engineers, polymaths, and entrepreneurs have advanced mankind in both small steps and giant leaps forward. But not all of those designs came to life while the hearts of their creators were still beating. Sometimes it was an abrupt death. Other times, it was lack of funding or public interest. Some inventions were even vague or hastily scrawled designs in the originator?s notebook. But many of them were finally built, sometimes hundreds of years after that person died. 10. Viola Organista - Leonardo da Vinci Notorious for being cryptic and vague, the polymath Leonardo da Vinci included in his Codex Atlanticus around 1490 the designs of an organ able of producing string sounds, like a violin, but which operated with a keyboard, like a piano. Leonardo, having the attention span of a true genius - which is to say, none at all - never bothered building it. However, his designs, although not extremely detailed, gave a good idea to future craftsmen about how to go about creating one. Around 1575 an instrument called ?Geigenwerk? was built by the German Hans Haiden. It resembled Leonardo?s original idea but operated on a slightly different mechanical principle. The most faithful interpretation of da Vinci?s schematics so far is the organ finished in 2012 by Slawomir Zubrzycki, 493 years after its intellectual father passed away. A truly unique organ, it has raised no small amount of musicians? eyebrows about how existing musical arrangements can be played with it. 9. Typewriter - Henry Mill Henry Mill was an English New River Company engineer. In 1714 he obtained a patent for ?an artificial machine or method for the impressing or transcribing of letters singly or progressively one after another?. Although vaguely described, Mill?s conception has been regarded as a first clear proposal of creating what later came to be known as a typewriter. Mill died in 1770, but the potential existence of such a machine got the attention of, among others, people trying to facilitate communication for blind people. In 1843, Charles Thurber constructed a machine for this purpose. Finally, in 1873, 103 years after Mill?s death, the Americans Christopher Sholes and Carlos Glidden put together what can be recognized today in form and function as a typewriter, revolutionizing the way people put their thoughts into paper. 8. Clifton Suspension Bridge - Isambard Kingdom Brunel One of Britain?s most revered figures, Isambard Kingdom Brunel is considered the founding father of modern civil engineering. He was only 24 years old when, in 1830, he was appointed project engineer for constructing a bridge above the river Avon in Bristol, after several rejections and conflicts with the committee tasked to approve submitted designs. The Clifton suspension bridge was not an easy project; at the time of construction, it had the longest span of any bridge in the world. Further delays and setbacks left the bridge unfinished at the time of his death. Being a heavy smoker, Brunel died of a stroke in 1859. Construction was continued based on Brunel?s designs, and the bridge was finally finished in 1864, a fitting memorial for the late engineer as well as an impressive landmark in its own right. Today, standing 214 meters long between its two 26 meter high towers, and 76 meters above the river, its core infrastructure remains unaltered. Brunel had to push the limits of civil engineering to the point that even modern calculations leave engineers in awe of how perfectly accurate and balanced his designs were. 7. Lear Fan 2100 - Bill Lear In the late 1970?s Bill Lear, inventor and founder of the Lear Jet Corporation, had an idea for a unique aircraft type. Made almost entirely of composite materials like carbon graphite, it would have the same durability at about half the weight of typical aluminum alloys. Its twin engines and rear-mounted propeller would make it about as fast as other jets at that time. The US Federal Aviation Administration, having reservations about gearbox and aerodynamics performance, refused to give the project the green light for production. Lear didn?t live long enough to perfect his dream, dying of leukemia in 1978. His desire to have the jet completed was so great that, as a dying wish, he told his wife Moya to finish it. With the help of British Government funding, the prototype made its maiden flight in 1981. Never having entered commercial production, three finished models are now in display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington, at the Frontiers of Flight Museum in Dallas, Texas, and in the back lot of FAA?s facility in Oklahoma City. 6. Demologos Steam Warship - Robert Fulton The first warship ever to be propelled by a steam engine, the United States Navy designs for the USS Demologos began in 1814. Robert Fulton, a renowned engineer and inventor, imagined a ship unlike any other: heavily armed and armored, and its twin hulls had a paddlewheel between them. The engine was on one hull, while the boilers were on the other. A floating fortress, well-suited for local defense, it weighed 2,475 displacement tons and was 48 meters long. In 1815, before the ship was completed, Fulton jumped in the icy waters of the Hudson River to save a friend who fell in. Struck by pneumonia which quickly developed into pulmonary tuberculosis, he died the same year. Shortly after, the Demologos was fully finished and the Navy renamed it the Fulton, to honor the inventor. The warship never saw any real action due to the end of the War of 1812 and it was destroyed in 1829 due to a gunpowder explosion. 5. Omnia Dir Airship - Enrico Forlanini There was a time where airships were considered a good idea for passenger transport. After the Great War, Italian inventor and aeronautical pioneer Enrico Forlanini sought to put into air traffic a new airship type with unprecedented maneuverability. In 1930 he presented the design of Omnia Dir, a 56-meter long dirigible with 4.000 cubic meters capacity. What made it special, aside from Forlanini?s already established expertise, was the addition of jet propulsion to the classic engine and propeller scheme. High-pressure air jets installed at the ship?s bow and stern offered the ship unbelievable, for the time, maneuvering speed, both on ground and in the air. Forlanini died in 1930 before the ship was completed and, aside for a test flight, it never entered mass production. Its innovative design, however, became a point of reference and helped study and develop auxiliary thrust technology in aircraft. 4. Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) - Alan Turing By the time World War II had ended, building a computer was entirely possible - anyone with half a million dollars and a really big room could have one. What was missing from the greater picture was a general-purpose computer. Existing models were very limited in what they could do - they could very specific tasks and nothing more. It was no wonder that the mathematical genius Alan Turing was summoned to build the very first electronic stored-program general-purpose digital computer. In 1946 he presented his design to the UK National Physical Laboratory. Work began in 1947. ACE operated nothing like modern systems do, as its logic resembled more biological neuron functions rather than the Boolean logic all modern computers are based on. Turing stayed a few months on the project, leaving NPL technicians baffled about how to carry on. The pilot model finished in 1950 was pretty fast for the time, though not exactly what Turing had envisioned. Turing died of cyanide poisoning in 1954, and the first full-scale ACE model was completed in 1957. 3. Pendulum Clock - Galileo Galilei When he was not being bullied by the Inquisition, Galileo observed and recorded physical phenomena. One of them was the back and forth motion of a suspended weight. The physics behind pendulum motion is no small deal. Its study paved the way for an entire branch of physics, namely the harmonic oscillators, a model that has helped represent and explain problems ranging from planetary motion to quantum mechanics. Galileo was the first to notice that, contrary to common intuition, the period of swing of a pendulum is independent of its swinging arc. In 1641, Galileo was 77 years old and blind. He had fully described the inner works of a pendulum clock and his son Vincenzo tried to make one without success. Galileo died in early 1642, leaving a lot of finely formulated physical theories to future scientists. It was in 1656, 14 years later, that the Dutch astronomer and physicist Christiaan Huygens built the world?s first pendulum clock. 2. Hi-Power Pistol - John Browning During the 1920s the French military requested a handgun that should be compact, have an ammo capacity of at least 10 rounds, could be easily assembled and disassembled, and could be produced at a low cost. John Browning, a legend among gun designers and salesmen, filed the patent in 1923. A thumb safety and external hammer were also incorporated in the design. Browning died in 1926 of heart failure, and the design was handed to and perfected by the Belgian Dieudonne Saive, finally introducing the gun in 1935. Although not adopted by the French Army at the time, the Hi-Power is one of the most recognizable, widely used, and most heavily sought firearms by collectors. Many conflicts in history had both sides using it due to its reliability and power for its size. It is still manufactured today in Japan. 1. The Difference Engine - Charles Babbage During the Victorian Era, all mathematical tables were calculated manually, a tedious process with many errors slipping in. Charles Babbage, an English mathematician and philosopher, envisioned a machine able to perform all those calculations automatically, thus eliminating errors. Conceived as a digital device, it used toothed wheels to represent and carry over digits from 0-9. It was not only suited for solving complex mathematical problems, but it also had temporary data storage, as well as the ability of printing the results onto soft metal. Funded with ?1,500 by the British government, Babbage hired Joseph Clement, a skilled engineer and began working on the Engine. By 1833 Clement refused to work further due to payment disputes, and the government ceased funding the project after having spent more than ?17,000. Babbage died in 1871, having lived his last years in bitterness for not seeing his work complete. In 1991, 120 years later, the London Science Museum finished constructing and put on display a fully functional Difference Engine, using technology available back in the Victorian Era. It has 4,000 parts and weighs three metric tons. Top image: Pilot Automatic Computing Engine (ACE). Credit: Antoine Taveneaux/Wikimedia Commons. [Source: Toptenz. Edited. Top image added.]",0

According to a press release from the FDA, between March 2013 and October 2015, the agency received reports of 101 confirmed cases of acute kidney injury, some of which required dialysis and hospitalization, related to Invokana/Invokamet (canagliflozin, Janssen Pharmaceuticals) and Farxiga/Xigduo XR (dapagliflozin, Bristol-Myers Squibb/AstraZeneca). The communication advised health care professionals to ?consider factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury prior to starting them on canagliflozin or dapagliflozin.? These include lower blood volume; chronic kidney insufficiency; congestive heart failure; and taking medications such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Then the MRI showed brain lesions and the report said NO MS PATTERN OR DEMYLINIZATION. My PCP said get another opinion, so I am waiting to see another Neuro Dr. March 1. I have recently had a left leg DVT and PE, enlarged heart and atrophy of the left Ventricle. I had several other clots as well in my lungs. Now I am confused as to what is going on. My RDW is high and my LDH. I am to have another CT again in 3 weeks. I am on WELFARIN. I am not taking the AVONEX anymore. Is this possibly a cancer not showing up yet? I do have fibrosis of the lung as well.. Can you give me some help here???? Mary ANSWER: Hi Mary, Sorry but we are not allowed to give specific medical advice on this site. But I will help as much as I can. How old are you? The suggestion to get an opinion by a neuro expert is a good one. I think it highly unlikely that the brain lesion is cancer. The circulatory and cardiac symptoms are certainly of concern, has a cardiologist discussed them with you? I can also see no connection between MS and the lung fibrosis. Did you have a history of other conditions before the MS diagnosis? Did they rule out lupus or another autoimmune disease? Do you have any occupational exposure to lung damaging agents or a smoking history? I hope this is of some help. I am happy to answer more questions, or help you interpret what your doctors tell you. All the best, Michael FOLLOW-UP Hi Michael: I am a prior smoker, but quit 9 yrs ago. I do have COPD and I have not been tested for LUPUS. Is it possible to have lesions with that? I just want to know what to ask this new NEUROLOGIST what would be good for mw. I was told to get another MRI of the Spinal Canal, seeing it has been nearly 5 yrs now. He was an MS specialist, and he said that if the lesions are on the brain, they are most likely on the spine too. I have been told I have Microvascular changes in the brain and stenosis in the lower legs. There is some vascular peticei I have not had a Cardio work-up in several years, but my NURSE came out and suggested I do see one, seeing I do have Cardiomegaly and Left V Hypertrophy. Maybe caused from the Clots. I can't get my Walfarin stableized yet!!! I will find out more when I go for my visit March 1. Thanks a Bunch ANSWER: Hi Mary, Lupus is a much more varied disease and can affect many more organ systems in the body, but they probably would have considered that previously, but it does not hurt to ask. The COPD would explain the fibrosis in the lungs, but I don't understand shat is causing your clotting problem, or the cardiac conditions, so it is good that you see a cardiologist regularly and the spine MRI also seems warranted. Again I don't see an obvious connection between the MS and the clotting or heart conditions. So that would be one thing to explore with the neurologist. I hope this has helped a bit. Best of luck, Michael FOLLOW-UP",1

The COPD is a progressive disease that makes it difficult to exit air from the lungs and needs quite strict treatment not to worse. The treatment can be done with medication, smoking cessation and in advanced cases to the use of home oxygen therapy. The cardiac causes are related to losswhen there is loss of contractile function of the heart loses some of its ability to pump blood forward and liquids become accumulated in various parts of the body, especially the lungs, causing pulmonary edema. This fluid accumulation in the lungs is responsible for the sensation of breathlessness. This condition is known as heart failure and there are several treatments for this problem, including cardiopulmonary rehabilitation, medications and visits by multidisciplinary team. I suggest you contact your cardiologist for further information and determine which therapies are needed to solve the problem. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help you. Wish you good health.",0

Patients awaiting a heart transplant or undergoing a long-term treatment find these devices useful. These mechanical pumps are surgically placed to support heart function and blood flow in people with heart failure (HF). The equipment is used in combination with other specialized treatments such as mechanical circulatory support system; the device does not replace the native heart but prolongs its life. The device takes blood from the lower chambers of the heart and pumps it to the vital organs of the body. Basically two types of VAD are used?left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and right ventricular assist device (RVAD)?the former being most commonly used for treating HF. RVADs are usually used after LVAD surgeries or other heart surgeries, particularly for short-term support functions. RVAD, also called a ""bridge to transplant,"" is often used in longer-term therapies. It helps the right ventricle to pump blood to the pulmonary artery. Increasing incidence of advanced HF across regions is a key factor boosting the growth of the VAD market. Growing use of the device in ?destination therapy? where it is surgically inserted for long-term support in patients who cannot undergo transplantation is expected to create ample growth opportunities in the market in the developed regions. Know More @ http://www.bigmarketresearch.com/global-vad-industry-2015-deep-research-report-market As per Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, approximately 42 % of all patients undergoing transplantation have a heart device; a majority of such devices consist of VADs. Increasing approvals by FDA for new VAD devices and advancements in technology used for heart therapies are expected to foster the growth of the market across major regions, such as Europe and the U.S. Furthermore, the incidence of transplant is limited mainly due to the scarcity of acceptable donors, which will create more demand for VADs devices. Leading providers for VAD implantation offer services related to superior management of the VAD equipment that helps in containing post-surgical maintenance costs and boost surgical outcomes. Keeping a track of the current and emerging trends, Big Market Research has added a report, titled ?Global VAD Industry 2015 Deep Market Research Report?. The report analyzes the key market dynamics, profile of manufacturers, and technological trends that shape up the competitive landscape scenario in VAD industry.",0

This edema is one that is very much on the part of the foot below the ankle, as the swollen feet climb up to the thighs or higher that this is a symptom of the disease. Swelling of feet during pregnancy is called toxicosis (gestosis). This is the condition of pregnant women, due to poisoning (toxemia) of dangerous substances, which are formed in the body of a pregnant woman during the progress of the development of the pregnancy, it is often accompanied by multiple symptoms that are sababiswa and the failure of the central nervous system , cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders. In that case then toxicosis is divided into two parts. Early toxicosis of pregnancy among first month SAWS third and subsequent commencing toxicosis. ie three months .. In that case, its symptoms vary .. zianzazo early toxicosis is usually seen in the first three months, but may sometimes until the beginning of the fourth month of pregnancy or even fifth. Toxicosis occurring after three months of pregnancy is often caused by major changes in the pregnant body, which in turn we say is being formed within the body., And niwakati that we see all the signs of pregnancy to pregnancy. The main reason appears performing early toxicosis in pregnant women is that they do not get enough sleep, busy, poor nutrition, smoking, alcohol misuse. Early symptoms of toxicosis in pregnancy include a woman to have a state of weakness, drowsiness, irritability, depression, and poor health, and salivation increases, loss of appetite, changes in taste sensation, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss . Other but it rarely happens, the shape of dermatitis (skin lesions), asthma and muscle spasms (cramps). Vomiting during pregnancy is one of the common manifestations of toxemia in pregnancy. Prevalence of vomiting during pregnancy is 60%, whereas 10% need treatment. Vomiting usually occurs during the first week until the next time 20 weeks of pregnancy. State vomiting matatutofauti divided into groups; ? The first group is the easy vomiting occurs more than 5 times a day, often after eating. Overall conditions remain normal woman, and lose weight in kilograms. ? The second group is vomiting on average., Vomiting occurs 10 times a day (you hungry or after eating) and weight loss in week 2.

If you haven't figured it out yet, I am not liking this type of weather. I can not be outside in weather like this because of my chronic congestive heart failure and I hate feeling stuck in the house all the time. I am so grateful that we have central air-conditioning because I need the air all summer. I can remember when I could go out in this weather. I loved going to the swimming pool or to Laurel Lake. Most of the time I'd sit in the sun and visit with family or friends. But, as much as I hate to say this, all that time in the sun, took it's toll on me. I've had numerous carcinomas removed from my face and neck areas. I was born a blue eyed, blond and the sun wasn't good for me. I remember, as a child, whenever we'd go to Laurel Lake for the day, my Mom would put sun tan lotion on me and also she'd make me wear a t-shirt over my swimming suit. I used to burn so quickly and I recall that on our drive home, my skin would be burning and hurting me. You'd think that having those memories, as a child, that as an adult, I'd stay out of the sun. Yeah, that didn't happen. That is, until about ten years ago. I guess we all have to learn the hard way, in some things anyway. I'm 68 years old and I'm still learning things, but I'm happy to say, that most of those things I don't learn the hard way. What have you all been up to lately? I do hope you're doing something creative, anything at all that's creative, is good. Maybe you ladies have made a new, fancy, tasty dessert for your family. That's being creative and it tastes good, too. My husband is making me a shelf that will fit above our new gas kitchen range. This one doesn't go back against the wall, the way the other one did, and it is a bit rounded on the top, in the back. I'm used to setting salt and pepper shakers on the back of the stove and now I can't. I thought he forgot about making a shelf, but he surprised me today when he headed into the basement and made one. He's now waiting for the paint to dry. See, he was being creative today also. I'm currently working on another manuscript, but it seems to be going slow for me. I'm not sure why. I just seem to be getting tired so much lately. I suppose it's partly my health and partly my age. I guess I'm an old lady now. No, that doesn't really bother me at all! Tomorrow is Sunday, the Lord's Day. So, whatever you have planned for tomorrow, I do hope that you will take some time for God in your day. Have a great Sunday and may God bless each of you. Susan God's beautiful sunset.",1

My son is in a similar situation, having survived lymphoma, but neither of my daughters have been in that situation and neither has my wife, so they are all having to deal with it now. I really upset my one daughter and wife, when I made the observation that since I am retired and no longer taking care of 2 of my grandchildren as often, I like to lay down on the couch in the afternoon and take a rest or a nap.

Most importantly, please know while genetics contributes to some degree, many other factors completely within your control can contribute to or reverse heart disease. Genetics loads the gun, but environment pulls the trigger. The way you eat, how much you exercise, how you manage stress, and your exposure to environmental toxins all contribute to things like high cholesterol, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and of course, heart disease. The current way doctors treat heart disease is misguided because they treat the risk factors not the causes. To think we can treat heart disease by lowering cholesterol, lowering blood pressure and lowering blood sugar with medication is like mopping up the floor while the sink overflows. Instead, we need to ask what causes these risk factors like high blood pressure, high blood sugar or abnormal cholesterol in the first place. Spoiler alert: These are not medication deficiencies! We treat these problems with medication, but studies have increasingly shown that treating these risk factors has only little benefit, or none at all. Research shows changing your lifestyle can be a more powerful intervention to prevent heart disease than any medication. The ?EPIC? study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine studied how 23,000 people adhered to four simple behaviors: Not smoking, exercising 3.5 hours a week, eating a healthy diet and maintaining a healthy weight. Adhering to those four behaviors alone prevented 93 percent of diabetes, 81 percent of heart attacks, 50 percent of strokes, and 36 percent of all cancers. Likewise, the INTERHEART study, published in the Lancet in 2004, followed 30,000 people in 52 countries. Researchers found changing lifestyle could prevent at least 90 percent of all heart disease. Other research shows lifestyle intervention becomes more effective than almost any other traditional medical intervention to reduce cardiovascular disease, hypertension, heart failure, stroke, cancer, diabesity and deaths from all causes. Your environment, in turn, changes gene expression, subsequently modulating inflammation, oxidative stress and metabolic dysfunction. These are the reasons we get sick and develop heart disease along with other problems. That?s actually good news. Addressing and fixing the root causes benefits most chronic disease. These modifications will make you feel alive and healthy without the side effects of medication. Occasionally, I will use medications if I feel a patient shows a strong genetic predisposition for heart disease or if significant heart disease already exists. Under those circumstances, I carefully weigh a medication?s risks and benefits. At the same time, most patients can achieve the benefits of most medications through lifestyle changes. Dr. David Jenkins from the University of Toronto compared treatment with statin drugs (the number one cholesterol medication) with a diet rich in viscous fiber, almonds, soy and plant sterols. Researchers in this study found that, while they created almost equal benefits, diet became more effective to lower inflammation and homocysteine (a risk marker for heart disease). I?ve, likewise, had patients lower their cholesterol (sometimes over 100 points) simply by incorporating positive dietary and lifestyle changes. Simply put, preventative medicine becomes the best form of medicine. These 10 simple modifications can go a long way to preventing or reversing heart disease. Eat a healthy diet. Increase healthy, whole foods rich in nutrients and phytonutrients (plant molecules). Aim for at least 8 to 10 servings of colorful fruits and vegetables every day. These foods are loaded with disease-fighting vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants and anti-inflammatory molecules. Steady your blood sugar. Studies show blood sugar imbalances contribute to heart disease. Stabilize your blood sugar with protein, healthy fat and healthy carbohydrates at every meal. Never eat carbohydrates alone, and avoid processed sugars with carbohydrates. I discuss this more in-depth in The Blood Sugar Solution 10-Day Detox Diet. Increase your fiber. Work your way up to 50 grams of fiber per day. High-fiber foods include vegetables, nuts, seeds and lower-sugar fruits like berries. If that becomes a challenge, try a fiber supplement such as PGX (Konjac fiber or glucomannan). Avoid processed, junk foods. That includes sodas, juices and diet drinks, which adversely impact sugar and lipid metabolism. Research shows liquid-sugar calories become the biggest contributor to obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Don?t be fooled that 100 percent fruit juice is healthy. Juices are essentially pure, liquid sugar because processing strips away the fruit?s fiber. Increase omega-3 fatty acids. Eat anti-inflammatory foods like cold-water fish including salmon, sardines and herring, as well as flaxseeds and even seaweed. Healthy fat actually benefits your heart by improving your overall cholesterol profile. It also lowers the small, dangerous LDL particles that contribute to heart disease by converting them into light, fluffy, safe LDL particles. I discuss how healthy fat can help you achieve and maintain good health in my new book, Eat Fat, Get Thin. Eliminate ALL hydrogenated fat. Hydrogenated fat lurks in margarine, shortening, processed oils and many baked goods and processed foods like cookies and crackers. Even when the label states ?no trans fats,? the word ?hydrogenated? indicates that the product contains trans fat in one or more of the ingredients. Use healthy oils instead like coconut oil (rich in medium-chain triglycerides or MCTs), extra-virgin, organic, cold-pressed, olive oil, organic sesame oil, and other nut oils. You can now find MCT oil in my store. Avoid or reduce alcohol intake. Alcohol can raise triglycerides, contribute to fatty liver and create sugar imbalances. Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake lowers inflammation, which contributes to heart disease and nearly every other chronic disease. Take quality supplements. Combined with a healthy diet and exercise program, supplements can dramatically improve cardiovascular health. Take a good multi-vitamin/mineral along with a purified fish oil supplement that contains 1000 to 2000 milligrams a day of EPA/DHA. (You might need higher doses if you have low HDL and high triglycerides.) I also recommend a fiber supplement such as PGX (Konjac fiber or gluccomanan) to lower cholesterol and balance blood sugar levels. You can find these and other supplements in my store. Get out and move! Research shows 30 to 45 minutes of cardiovascular exercise at least five times a week can benefit your heart. After all, your heart is a muscle, and muscles need exercise. If you feel stronger and more capable, high-intensity interval training (also called burst training) and strength training help build muscle, reduce body fat composition and maintain strong bones. You simply cannot age successfully without sufficient, optimal exercise. Manage stress levels. Stress alone can cause a heart attack. Sadly, chronic stress often triggers a cascade of events that cause that final, fatal heart attack. Among its problems, stress increases inflammation, raises your cholesterol and blood sugar, increases blood pressure and even makes your blood more likely to clot. Find your pause button to manage stress and relax. Yoga, Tai Chi, meditation, breathing techniques and guided imagery can lower stress. Many patients find my UltraCalm CD helps dials down stress levels very effectively. I want to hear from you. Have you improved your heart health with diet and lifestyle changes?

The relationship between the two conditions is complex, and the mechanisms by which they may trigger or exacerbate one another are not yet well understood. But the fundamental connection between OSA and cardiovascular disease is strong. Studies indicated that obstructive sleep apnea is 2-3 times more prevalent among people with cardiovascular disease than those without. Research shows that the mortality rate for cardiovascular disease is higher among older adults who also have OSA. Sleep apnea is linked to several cardiovascular conditions, including high blood pressure, arrhythmia, heart disease, heart failure, and stroke. Two common conditions Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among adults in the United States. Obstructive sleep apnea affects an estimated 25 million or more U.S. adults -- with the great majority of cases remaining undiagnosed and untreated. Deepening our understanding of the relationship between sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease is critical to public health. How OSA may trigger heart disease Recent research reveals new details in the relationship between heart disease and sleep apnea, and also points to a possible treatment for lowering cardiovascular risks for people with OSA. Scientists at Columbia University Medical Center found that statins -- a type of drug used to treat cholesterol -- may reverse the damage done to the cardiovascular system that appears to occur as a consequence of sleep apnea. The scientists also identified new information about the process by which obstructive sleep apnea may inflict cardiovascular damage. According to the study, people with OSA exhibit abnormalities in a protein that helps to limit cellular inflammation. The dysfunction with this particular protein - -known as CD59 -- appears to leave people with obstructive sleep apnea more vulnerable to inflammation, which is regarded as a significant contributor to cardiovascular disease. The study included 128 people, including 78 with a diagnosis of sleep apnea and 52 who did not meet the diagnostic criteria for OSA. Scientists analyzed blood samples from all participants, looking in particular at endothelial cells -- cells that line the interior walls of blood vessels. The protein CD59 is normally found in these cells, lining blood vessel walls. From within the cell lining, CD59 works to prevent the buildup of inflammatory proteins on the surface of cells. Scientists found that among people with obstructive sleep apnea, CD59 levels were elevated compared to those without OSA. Researchers found something else, both surprising and significant. In people with sleep apnea, CD59 protein was found primarily within the interior section of blood vessel cells, rather than in the cells' lining, as would have been expected -- and was the case among people without sleep apnea. At a greater distance from cell walls, the CD59 protein was less able to exert its protective effect against inflammation. The result? A greater build-up of inflammatory proteins on the cells of people with obstructive sleep apnea, researchers found. Statins a solution? Included in the study were a small number of subjects with OSA who were already being treated with statins. Among this sub-group of sleep apnea sufferers, researchers discovered that CD59 remained in place in the lining of cells, in a position to inhibit inflammation -- similar to people without OSA. Additional research found that in people with OSA, the inward migration of CD59 is influenced by cholesterol. This finding is important, opening the possibility of statins' use as a therapy to prevent cardiovascular damage in people with obstructive sleep apnea. Further study needs to take place before we'll know whether statins can serve as a viable treatment to prevent or reverse the cardiovascular damage from OSA, but this is a promising lead. More broadly, this study also provides some much needed insight into the process by which obstructive sleep apnea affects cardiovascular health and function. The disrupted breathing of OSA Obstructive sleep apnea involves repeated interruptions to normal breathing during sleep. During sleep, the airway temporarily narrows or closes altogether, compromising or fully interrupting breath flow. These episodes of shallow or paused breathing can last a few seconds, or more than a minute. In cases of mild sleep apnea, breathing is interrupted between 5-15 times an hours. In cases of moderate to severe sleep apnea, breathing is interrupted 15-30 times an hour, or more. People with OSA are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease as well as other serious medical conditions, including type 2 diabetes and depression. They are also at significantly greater risk for accident and injury, in large part because of the tiredness and fatigue that accompany this sleep disorder. Undiagnosed and untreated Why do so many cases of obstructive sleep apnea go undiagnosed? Often, people with sleep apnea aren't aware of their most obvious symptoms -- since they occur during sleep. Snoring and other sounds of disrupted breathing during sleep can be signs of sleep apnea. Bed partners are frequently the people who are aware of these symptoms, before the sleepers themselves. Even when people are aware they snore or breathe with difficulty during sleep, they too often don't address these issues with their physicians. And physicians themselves often don't make the topic of sleep -- and questions about sleep-disordered breathing -- a priority during physicals and check ups. What's more, many people aren't aware of the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea that exist in addition to snoring: ? Dry mouth or sore throat upon waking ? Headaches, especially in the morning ? Severe tiredness during the daytime ? Trouble with concentration ? Memory problems ? Mood issues, including depression, anxiety, and irritability The regular presence of any of these symptoms, even in the absence of snoring, warrants conversation with a physician. Treatment works for OSA Sleep apnea can wreak havoc with nightly rest, undermining health and daily performance. The good news is that OSA can be treated effectively with a number of different therapies. CPAP -- continuous positive airway pressure -- therapy is highly effective in reducing or eliminating sleep apnea, and is generally the recommended treatment for more severe cases of OSA. Other forms of PAP, or positive airway pressure, are also used to treat OSA. Oral appliances -- devices worn inside the mouth during sleep -- can also significantly improve sleep apnea, and are increasingly recommended for mild and moderate sleep apnea, as well as for people who have difficulty using CPAP therapy. Positional therapy -- switching sleeping position -- is the simplest form of sleep apnea treatment, and can be effective particularly in cases of mild OSA. Airway obstructions and disrupted breathing are more likely to occur when sleeping on one's back. Moving to a side-sleeping position can reduce the frequency of interrupted-breathing episodes, and may even resolve mild sleep apnea in some cases. Lifestyle modifications, including losing weight, also help to alleviate OSA. We need to improve our diagnosis rates OSA, and get more people into treatment for sleep apnea and the other health complications that often accompany the disorder. This latest research provides some significant new insight into how sleep apnea works to undermine heart health -- and may indicate a new way to treat and protect people with sleep apnea against cardiovascular risks.

It never hurts to be reminded of that. Just last week, one of my beach guests, recovering from chest pains while overlooking the ocean, had received that very reminder from her husband (hysterically responding to him with, ""Who are you and what have you done with my husband?""). But it was sage advice. Today's rainy road trip took me far enough into Mathews County that I was within spitting distance of Gwynn's Island to interview a successful business owner about his past, present and future. Standard stuff, right? Except, no, anything but. Imagine a 38-year old man having a heart problem misdiagnosed and now, six years later, his heart is in such bad shape as a result that in two days he will have a battery-powered mechanical pump implanted to stave off end-stage heart failure, followed by his name going on the heart transplant list. Turns out that last week while I was reveling in my annual week in Kitty Hawk, he was a few miles away in Nags Head relishing his last trip frolicking in the ocean, at least until he gets a new heart because pumps and swimming are incompatible. It's almost too difficult to get my head around the idea of going in the ocean last week (as I did) without knowing if you'll ever be able to go in again. I look back now with cosmic gratitude for his sake for the 70-degree water. The thing is, he's only 44 years old now and his life is already drastically changed and things are about to undergo even more adjustment post-surgery. So while I'll be flying across the pond Thursday, he'll be holed up at MCV, a few blocks from my house, undergoing eight hours of surgery and spending three weeks there recovering from it. All because someone made a bad call and now he's paying with his health, perhaps even his life. I know, I know, plenty of people have terrible things happen to them while others blithely move through life with nothing more serious than the usual bumps and scrapes that all humans experience. When I shared my own great tragedy from a couple decades ago, he teared up in empathy, but we found common ground in a shared philosophy. When bad things happen, good people have two choices: curl up in a ball and give up, or deal and move on, which brings us back to carpe diem. So I seized the day by making the most of a wet foray to the bay, loving up on two personable beagles - an old one at his house and a young one in the hallway of my apartment building - walking twice, morning and evening, simply because I could and seeing ""Genius,"" a geeky literary movie based on a geeky, literary bio I read over a decade ago. Don't mind me, I'm just over here gathering my rosebuds while I may. With, by the way, enormous gratitude for the ability to do so.",0

Some of them can hurt you? and some might even KILL you! I?m sure you remember Vioxx and Bextra, the deadly painkillers pulled from the market after they were linked to serious heart risks. Vioxx alone has been blamed for between 50,000 and 60,000 deaths, and some scientists believe the true toll could be much higher. But don?t breathe a sigh of relief just yet. While Vioxx and Bextra are gone, the drugs still on the market could be just as bad. The new study looked at years of research on common NSAID painkillers, including COX-2 inhibitors, and found some of these older and supposedly safer drugs can cause the same kinds of heart problems as Vioxx and Bextra, especially if you already have heart disease. The worst of the bunch, unfortunately, is one of the drugs used most often: diclofenac. The new study has shocked some doctors ? but it?s right in line with research published in 2013, which found that prolonged use of common NSAID painkillers such as ibuprofen and diclofenac can double your risk of heart failure and increase overall heart risk by about a third. The scary part about that, of course, is that?s exactly how arthritis patients use the meds ? over the long run. Some folks can?t even get through a day without hitting the pill bottle. And if you?re one of them, it?s time to make some changes before you pay the ultimate price. Don?t swap your NSAIDs for Tylenol. Acetaminophen might be safer on the heart, but it?s tougher on the liver. Overdoses of this drug are now the nation?s leading cause of acute liver failure. Besides, a second new study finds it doesn?t even work! Acetaminophen is only barely better than a placebo for both pain and function in osteoarthritis patients, and it does absolutely nothing to slow the progression of the disease itself. I know, it sounds like I?m taking away just about all your options for pain relief. I?m not ? instead, I?m opening a doorway to a whole new world, one where you can get real relief without the risks. One study last year found that chondroitin can ease knee pain due to osteoarthritis as effectively as the painkiller Celebrex. Even better, it can also SLOW the progression of the disease itself ? something Celebrex has never even claimed to do. But why stop there? Chondroitin work wells for many people, but there?s something that?s been proven to work even better: an all-natural form of collagen called UC-II.

This focus has been the underpinning for numerous policy interventions, most notable of which is the Affordable Care Act?s Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), which penalizes hospitals for higher than expected readmission rates. The motivation behind HRRP is simple: the readmission rate, the proportion of discharged patients who return to the hospital within 30 days, had been more or less flat for years and reducing this rate would save money and potentially improve care. So it was big news when, as the HRRP penalties kicked in, government officials started reporting that the national readmission rate for Medicare patients was declining. Rising Use of Observation Status But during this time, another phenomenon was coming into focus: increasing use of observation status. When a patient needs hospital services, there are two options: that patient can be admitted for inpatient care or can be ?admitted to observation?. When patients are ?admitted to observation? they essentially still get inpatient care, but technically, they are outpatients. For a variety of reasons, we?ve seen a decline in patients admitted to ?inpatient? status and a rise in those going to observation status. These two phenomena ? a drop in readmissions and an increase in observation ? seemed related. I ? and others ? spoke publicly about our concerns that the drop in readmissions was being driven by increasing observation admissions. An analysis by David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler in the Health Affairs blog suggested that most of the drop in readmissions could be accounted for both by increases in observation status and by increases in returns to the emergency department that did not lead to readmission. Two months later, a piece by Claire Noel-Miller and Keith Lund, also in the Health Affairs blog, found that the hospitals with the biggest drop in readmissions appeared to have big increases in their use of observation status. It seemed like much of the drop in readmissions was about reclassifying people as ?observation? and administratively lowering readmissions without changing care. New Data Now comes a terrific, high quality study in the New England Journal of Medicine that takes this topic head on. The authors examine directly whether the hospitals that lowered their readmission rates were the same ones that increased their observation status ? and find no correlation. None. If you?re ever looking for a scatter plot of two variables that are completely uncorrelated, look no further than Figure 3 of the paper. The best reading of the evidence prior to the study did not turn out to be the truth. It reminds me of the period we were all convinced, based on excellent observational data, that hormone replacement therapy was lifesaving for women with cardiovascular disease. And that became the standard of care ? until someoneconducted a randomized trial, and found that HRT provided little benefit to these patients. That?s why we do research ? it moves our knowledge forward. Where are we now? So where does this leave us? Is the ACA?s readmissions policy a home run? Here?s what we know: the HRRP has, most likely (we have no controls) led to fewer patients being readmitted to the hospital. Second, the HRRP does not seem responsible for the increase in observation stays. Here?s what we don?t know: is a drop in readmissions a good thing for patients? It may seem obvious that it is but if you think about it, you realize that readmission rate is a utilization measure, not a patient outcome. It?s a measure of how often patients use inpatient services within 30 days of discharge. Utilization measures, unto themselves, don?t tell you whether care is good or bad. So the real question is ? has the HRRP improved the underlying quality of care? It might be that we have improved on care coordination, communications between hospitals and primary care providers, and ensuring good follow-up. That likely happened in some places. Alternatively, it might be that we have just made it much harder for that older, frail woman with heart failure sitting in the emergency room to get admitted if she was discharged in the last 30 days. That too has likely happened in some places. But how much of it is the former versus the latter? Until we can answer that question, we won?t know whether care is better or not. Beyond understanding why readmissions have fallen, we also don?t know how HRRP has affected the other things that hospitals ought to focus on, such as mortality and infection rates. If your parent was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, what would be your top priority? Most people would say that they would like their parent not to die. The second might be to avoid serious complications like a healthcare associated infection or a fall that leads to a hip fracture. Another might be to be treated with dignity and respect. Yes, avoiding being readmitted would be nice ? but for me at least, it pales in comparison to avoiding death and disability. We know little about the potential spillover effects of the readmission penalties on the things that matter the most. So here we are ? a good news study that says readmissions are down because fewer people are being readmitted to the hospital, not because people are being admitted to observation status. That?s important. But the real challenge is in figuring out whether patients are better off. Are they more likely to be alive after hospitalization? Do they have fewer functional limitations? Less pain and suffering? Until we answer those questions, it?ll be hard to know whether this policy is making the kind of difference we want. And that?s the point of science ? using data to answer those questions. Because we all can have our opinions ? but ultimately, it?s the data that counts. Ashish Jha, MD, MPH (@ashishkjha) is the C.

About scPharmaceuticals: scPharmaceuticals, based in Lexington, MA , is a privately held biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of transformative pharmaceutical products for subcutaneous delivery. Based on widely used generic drugs that currently require intravenous or intramuscular injections, our innovative products will be administered subcutaneously via a proprietary patch pump. This avoids material risks and costs associated with the current delivery options. Our lead products are the first subcutaneous formulations of furosemide (the most widely used parenteral diuretic in treating heart failure) and ceftriaxone (the most widely used parenteral antibiotic outside the hospital setting). Our novel furosemide formulation enables convenient anytime anywhere use, for example in an outpatient setting instead of the emergency room or other in-patient settings. For ceftriaxone and other antibiotics, subcutaneous administration eliminates the need for PICCs (peripherally inserted central catheters), which are associated with serious complications, frequent adverse events and high medical cost.

Feeling slightly guilty and slightly scared. (SW 265 CW 240 GW ??),"Bach at the end of March I had heart surgery and was in the hospital for two weeks. During that time my weight dropped about 25 lbs (some of that, admittedly, was fluid in my lungs since I was technically in heart failure). I've now been out of the hospital for two weeks, and I have maintained the weight loss so far. My problem is that 1) I feel slightly guilty that I lost the weight effortlessly, merely from being laid up for all that time, and 2) I'm afraid that it will come back once I've recovered. I'm not eating much right now, and I guess a lot of my energy is going toward healing. It feels like the weight will just come back as soon as I don't need the energy to heal any more. What happens when I've recovered and get back to ""normal""? I don't know if I can maintain this. Anybody have a similar experience?",1

(AP) ? A settlement has been reached in a lawsuit filed by survivors of an eastern Pennsylvania woman who died nearly two years ago during a weekend jail stint over school truancy fines. A lawyer representing the adult children of Eileen DiNino filed an affidavit in federal court in Philadelphia on March 7 confirming that a settlement had been reached and proceeds had been distributed to the heirs of the mother of seven, The Reading Eagle ( http://bit.ly/21MnVjD ) reported. DiNino, 55, of Reading was found unresponsive in her cell in Berks County jail in June 2014. She had been ordered to spend two days for failure to pay $2,000 in fines stemming from her children's school absences. The debt had accrued since 1999 and involved several of her children. A state police review found that she reported having ""discomfort and some difficulty breathing,"" while in custody, was seen by medical staff and was then returned to her cell, where guards were to check on her. An autopsy concluded she died of natural causes, including high blood pressure that contributed to heart failure, and state police concluded no charges should be filed. The lawsuit named the county and PrimeCare Medical Inc., which provides health care services in the jail, among others. A judge last fall granted a request to have the case against the county dismissed. Court documents indicate that the jail care provider agreed to a settlement Jan. 12. The suit did not name a specific amount but asked for compensatory and punitive damages. The agreement was sealed and officials, principals and attorneys couldn't be reached for comment or declined to offer any. Following DiNino's death, state House members approved a bill that would provide judges with alternatives to incarceration for minor offenses. The bill awaits action in the Senate, where two members have proposed completely removing incarceration as an alternative in truancy cases. ?",0

A Winnipeg woman is in court this week for allegedly stealing from a medical trust fund set up for her niece who was waiting for a life-saving heart transplant. Sheryl Matheson, who is 42, was arrested in March 2011 after police alleged she had withdrawn thousands of dollars and used it for personal purchases. Her niece, Jessica Bondar, 19, died a few weeks later in a Montreal hospital. Bondar had been battling health issues for two years after suffering heart failure due to complications from the flu. Court has heard that Matheson set up the fund in 2009 and the Crown says she almost immediately began withdrawing funds. Matheson has pleaded not guilty to fraud over $5,000 and theft over $5,000.

J Am Coll Cardiol. 2016 Feb 9;67(5):502-11 Authors: Papolos A, Narula J, Bavishi C, Chaudhry FA, Sengupta PP Abstract BACKGROUND: Increased use of echocardiography (echo) raises questions of whether echo is an overused diagnostic procedure in the United States. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated national trends, practice patterns, and patient outcomes associated with inpatient echo use reported in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). METHODS: We identified admission diagnoses most commonly associated with echo use and performed multivariate logistic regression within each diagnosis cohort to assess whether echo use was associated with all-cause inpatient mortality. Secondary analysis was performed within our institution to validate use trends identified in the NIS database. RESULTS: Between 2001 and 2011, the absolute volume and incidence of echo steadily increased at average annual rates of 3.41% and 3.04%, respectively. In 2010, the use of echo was associated with lower odds of inpatient mortality among hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63 to 0.86; p < 0.001), cardiac dysrhythmia (adjusted OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.94; p = 0.02), acute cerebrovascular disease (adjusted OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.42; p < 0.001), congestive heart failure (adjusted OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.72 to 0.94; p = 0.005), and sepsis (adjusted OR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.70 to 0.85; p < 0.001). In 2010, these 5 diagnoses accounted for 3.7 million hospital admissions (9% of all hospitalizations); however, echo was reported in only 8% of cases. Secondary analysis of imaging practices at our institution confirmed underuse of echo among patients who died during hospitalization for indications identified in the NIS database. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing rates of performance, echo may be underused during critical cardiovascular hospitalizations. PMID: 26846948 [PubMed ? in process]",0

Now I'd say do ANYTHING else because the career is being ruined"", which was rather disheartening... I've really enjoyed it as a student - it's one of the few placements where I've felt I've been learning at every moment and sometimes helping to make a difference too. I would hope to have a similar experience during foundation years, though like you, I've been told it's terrible as a career and to steer well clear. I'm not that interested in the long term management of chronic conditions e.g. heart failure, asthma, etc, but I find learning about the acute exacerbations of the same conditions really interesting. Not a big fan of clinics or ward rounds either, but still really enjoy clerkings and presenting patients. I also really like learning practical procedures and the idea of being a generalist is appealing. All of the EM physicians I've been attached to have been great teachers, and I think it's a specialty which would lend itself well to clinical teaching.

And this could be a cause of low blood pressure. If your husband has severe heart failure, it can also be a cause for low levels of blood pressure. In this situation, we must optimize the specific therapeutic to this problem. Moreover, in this situation, also the use of medications to raise the pressure can be deleterious to the patient.

No other measure can help promote a healthy heart than a healthy lifestyle. Refrain from foods that attack the heart and lifestyles that weaken the immune system. Take these herbs along with you and live a healthy life. Hawthorn Hawthorn is a great agent used to prevent angina, high blood pressure, indigestion, congestive heart failure, and atherosclerosis. Many claim of its antioxidant properties that help in stimulating efficient blood flow and strengthening the blood vessels. Hawthorn has shown capabilities at handling the symptoms caused by chronic heart conditions. Motherwort Known as a mild sedative and an aid for a healthy heart, motherwort has become a common name among the medical cabinets all across the globe. When patients complain about palpitations of the heart and pains in the chest, they were given motherwort. This herb is common among tonics aimed to help develop a healthy heart. Cacao Extracts of cacao are great at improving the levels of the blood pressure in the body. It is a good source of magnesium. Getting the right recommended amounts of magnesium lessens the effects of stress in the body. Free radicals are eliminated with the antioxidant present in cacao. It also provides protection from the development of different cardiovascular illnesses. The reason why dark chocolates are efficient in the promotion of a healthy heart is the absence of sugars that trigger negative effects in the body, especially the heart. Cayenne Cayenne is another herb that promotes a healthy heart and efficient blood circulation. It is great at calming the heart activities and tone down palpitations. Removal of the plaque from arteries, removal of toxins, and rebuilding of blood cells are among the common benefits of this herb. It promotes absorption and digestion. A daily intake of cayenne in the diet is the surefire way to improve the health of the heart. Garlic It was believed that the Egyptians have hundreds of ways to use garlic medicinally. Bad cholesterol is controlled with garlic. Studies have confirmed the efficiency of a clove of garlic against the aggregation of the platelets. These herbs work great with proper diet and exercise. Involve a healthy lifestyle along with the right choices of food. An intentional approach to a healthy lifestyle is still the best preventive and counter measure against diseases. source : http://www.healthdigezt.com",0

The study released at the American College of Cardiology conference in Chicago was based on 200 people with diabetes who had not shown any symptoms of heart disease. Researchers found that those with larger waist circumferences were more likely than smaller-bellied people to have problems with the heart's left ventricle, which pumps oxygen-rich blood to the brain and the rest of the body. ""We specifically found that waist circumference appears to be a stronger predictor for left ventricle dysfunction than total body weight or body mass index,"" said principal investigator Boaz Rosen, a doctor at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. Previous research has shown that the higher a person's body mass index (BMI) -- a measure of a person's height and weight -- the greater their risk of heart disease. Having excess belly fat, or having an apple-shaped figure, has already been linked to high blood pressure, high sugar levels, elevated cholesterol, coronary artery disease and heart failure. ""Our research examined patients with diabetes, who are considered high risk for developing heart disease already, and found that the shape of your body determined if you were at a greater risk to develop left ventricular dysfunction,"" said Brent Muhlestein, co-director of research at the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Salt Lake City. ""This study confirms that having an apple-shaped body -- or a high waist circumference -- can lead to heart disease, and that reducing your waist size can reduce your risks."" Problems with the left ventricle can lead to congestive heart failure. Researchers said more study is needed to see if diabetic patients with large waists and signs of heart problems go on to develop heart failure or artery disease in the future.",0

She and Lucius were originally introduced as children by their parents, during the years when House Morningstar was the most powerful and influential of the Four Great Houses. Unbeknownst to them, their parents had betrothed them in secret- an arrangement that crumbled along with House Morningstar. Over the years, she has maintained a close friendship with Lucius, and the two visit each other often. However, their friendship is highly controversial and outright frowned upon by the other nobles, especially Dianna's uncle and Duchess Marion, head of the Great House Gracewind. There are rumors that Duchess Marion and Archduke Fallon are currently having secret talks about an arranged marriage between Marion's son and Queen Dianna- behind the Queen's back. Lucius Morningstar: Age: 19 Height: 6'1 Build: Athletic and muscular Hair Color: Light Blond Eye Color: Reddish Brown The youngest son of the esteemed but eccentric adventurer Larius Morningstar. Lucius's father was once a well respected scholar, politician, and explorer, and the vast amounts of wealth he accumulated served to make House Morningstar the wealthiest noble house in all of Elmine. However, that changed once he became obsessed with finding the lost secrets of the legendary Bard Taliesin. Since his father regularly spent long periods of time abroad, Lucius was given a formal education and raised to be a leader from a young age. He grew up on stories of Taliesin, and stories brought back from his father's travels, and those drove him to study music and literature. He soon proved to be a musical prodigy with a naturally beautiful singing voice, and was granted a full scholarship to the Bard's College in Daram at an unprecedented age. A few months before he was set to graduate, however, his father disappeared and his house went bankrupt. His older brother abandoned the family to join the Holy Knights soon after, leaving a young Lucius suddenly in charge of the entire estate. He spent the next several years fighting to keep his family's name and status, and struggling to pay off their debt and earn money at the same time. Now, while House Morningstar is still technically a Great House(Thanks to Lucius's efforts), they have no real power. He is a very pragmatic individual, even a bit cynical, but is adept at hiding his true feelings. He has an intense hatred for his brother, and is determined to restore his fallen house to its former glory- by proving his father was right and finding the lost secrets of Taliesin. Garth Valastair: A wizened old retainer of House Morningstar, he served Lucius's father before him and his father before that. He has seen two generations of Mornibgstars come and go, and is as much part of the House's history as the house itself. While he can be a bit stubborn and set in his ways, he is faithful and loyal and genuinely wants the best for the House. He often nags and complains about Lucius's unorthodox methods, and sometimes his apparent irresponsibility, but he cares for the boy like his grandson and knows, deep down, just how much Lucius cares about him and the House. The Great House Morningstar: Formerly the most powerful of all the noble houses in Elmine, second only to the Royal Family, the Great House Morningstar suffered a series of rapid declines and financial problems after the former head, Larius Morningstar, spent the entire family fortune on a failed expedition into the Wilds, in search of Taliesin's lost secrets. It was an expedition from which he never returned. Shortly after, his wife Elizabeth Morningstar passed away in her sleep due to heart failure, and the eldest son of the family abandoned his duties and joined the Holy Knights, thus making the youngest son, Lucius, the de facto head of the House. The Great House has retained its rank in the nobility- albeit barely- but any remaining influence now only stems from Lucius's friendship with Queen Dianne. The Great House Morningstar is one of the oldest families in all of Elmine. Note: As you unlock more entries, more and more entries will be filled and fleshed out. Think of it like a puzzle.

When attached to an object, the user can track its movement whenever in transit. This technology has been used in several sectors to protect and keep a record of precious goods, products and machinery. With a consistent growth and elevation in technology, researchers of the world have able to combine NFC (Near Field Communication) technology with RFID. NFC is communication between compatible devices within a short range. Compilation of NFC with RFID tags has enabled users to utilize features like Bluetooth pairing, device authentication, connection handover and Wi-Fi protected set up. NFC is actually a sub-category or a branch of RFID both of which operate at 13.56 MHz frequency. RFID tags operate and function on three different frequency ranges. 1. Low Frequency (LF): 125-134 kHz tags 2. High Frequency (HF): 13.56mhz tag 3. Ultra High Frequency (UHF): 856 MHz to 960 MHz tags The High Frequency 13.56mhz tag is eminently used in the logistics and transport sector so as to trace objects. It is a resourceful device that has NFC features with it. In healthcare sectors, these tags are useful in storing patient information, previous health records, medication prescribed and surgeries undergone (if any). These tags can be read from a considerable range and can be connected to gadgets like smart phones, tablets, laptops, etc. on which information can be read easily. Once the patient is discharged from the hospital, the tags are removed and destroyed. Their range is about 5 inches and when connected with accordant readers, their range is up to 3 fts. RFID 13.56mhz tag are not used only in high power industries and organizations with high turnovers, it is also used in laundry identification. In the hospitality sector, where a large number of people come for a luxury stay, laundry service is provided to them for convenience. But it is difficult to identify that which cloth belongs to whom. RFID technology is an effective solution for it. The consolidation of NFC and RFID has undoubtedly fulfilled the identification and tracking needs of various industries and will continue to grow more in other sectors as well.

Following a five-year research project, a team of scientists has found that vitamin D3 can be beneficial to patients with chronic heart failure. The findings were presented at the American College of Cardiology 65th Annual Scientific Session & Expo in Chicago, USA. Scientists from the University of Leeds, UK, have found that taking a vitamin D supplement can improve the pumping action of the heart in patients with heart muscle weakness. The majority of such patients are aged 75 and over and produce less vitamin D naturally from exposure to sunlight than younger people. The team studied 160 patients who were already following treatments for heart failure, such as beta-blockers (which regulate heart rate), ACE-inhibitors (which improve heart function and keep blood pressure down) and pacemakers. The study found that in the 80 patients who took vitamin D3 every day for a year, the heart's pumping function increased from 26% to 34%. Those who took a placebo saw no improvement in heart function. Note that the patients were given non-calcium based supplements to avoid further complications. The cardiologists evaluated heart function by measuring what's known as the ejection fraction -- the amount of blood pumped by the heart with each heartbeat. For a healthy person, this is usually between 60% and 70%. For patients in the study, the average ejection fraction was 26%. In conclusion, the researchers consider that heart failure patients may be able to start taking a vitamin D3 supplement on a regular basis. This may reduce the need for fitting implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) in certain patients. This costly operation implants a device that detects irregular heart rhythms and shocks the heart to restore a normal rhythm. Heart failure affects 23 million people worldwide and more than half of sufferers are aged 75 or older. Natural sources of vitamin D include eggs, dairy products, oily fish (sardines, mackerel), calf's liver and cod liver oil.",0

After talking a bit he started smiling ear to ear and made the comment, ""guess we chose right"" as to how to do the procedure. He's totally amazed at my recovery and the fact the congestive heart failure is something in the past. Had to shake my had a few times and almost skipped through the office.

It was super scary and no one could figure out why it happened. I lost 17 pounds of fluids in 25 hours in the hospital. Thankfully I recovered without any damage. About 3 months later i started having joint pain. Having 4 kids ages 5 and under, I ignored it and went on with my life assuming it was my hormones normalizing after delivery. Then I went on vacation for a week with my mom and she was shocked at my limping and being unable To open things every day. She insisted she would take me to the doctor when we got home. So, the following week I made an appt and my mom literally picked me up from my house and took me to the doctor to make sure I would go. The doc agreed that it was likely just hormone related after pregnancy by ordered labs. And my RF factor came back high. Then I saw a rheumatologist and still wasn't convinced that everything else was ruled out. So, before starting the methotrexate I waited to get a second opinion from a Harvard trained rheumatologist in Miami. He ordered a ton of more blood work but in the end agreed with the diagnosis and the starting methotrexate and so that is what I did. That was almost 4 years ago.

BLOG,futurity.org,http://www.futurity.org/cardiac-fibrosis-bile-acid-1212852-2/,7/27/2016,12:03:05,,,"There?s currently no treatment for cardiac fibrosis, a leading cause of heart failure. But new research suggests there may be a way to prevent it. The study found specific triggers that activate the development of fibrosis. Blocking the triggers through the use of a bile acid prevented cardiac fibrosis from occurring, according to results in a pre-clinical model. ?The bottom line is that this shows for the first time that cardiac fibrosis is preventable.? ?This is something that nobody has ever seen before,? says Marek Michalak, co-principal investigator and a professor in biochemistry at the University of Alberta. ?Cardiac fibrosis is considered a permanent remodeling of the heart. Inevitably it leads to heart failure and eventually death. ?The bottom line is that this shows for the first time that cardiac fibrosis is preventable.? Luis Agellon, co-principal investigator and a professor at McGill University?s School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition, says the findings offer hope to those who are living with heart failure. ?Prevention of fibrosis will extend the ability of the heart to continue to function, even if at a reduced capacity. Currently patients with heart failure have poor quality of life and a dismal prognosis. Improving their quality of life will do wonders for these individuals,? says Agellon. Fibrosis is an early step on the path to heart failure. Once a person is diagnosed with heart failure, about 30 percent will die within the first year. Next step: clinical trials Cardiac fibrosis itself is caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, overwork of cardiac muscle, and long-term consumption of a diet that is high in both saturated fat and sugar?all cause increased stress to heart cells. Individuals with diabetes, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, and heart transplant recipients are also known to be at high risk. ?It?s almost like building a scar,? says Michalak. ?It?s exactly the same type of biological activity but it?s happening in the tissue in the heart. It destroys the ability of the heart to function normally.? Heart risks spike after 2 weeks of sugary drinks The team is now pushing forward with additional studies to see if the same therapeutic effect can be achieved in humans. They also aim to gain a better understanding of exactly how bile acids can prevent cardiac fibrosis from occurring. ?We don?t yet have a full understanding?nobody does?of how the bile acid actually does what it does in heart cells,? explains Michalak. ?So, another phase of the work is to find out what actually happens within heart cells at the molecular level. How can this bile acid affect the heart in such a dramatic way?? Once that occurs, the team hopes to work with cardiologists to quickly move the research into clinical trials involving chemotherapy and heart transplant patients. ?If cardiac fibrosis can be stopped, then that could substantially improve the outcome for people at risk,? says Agellon. ?This would be a significant advance in the fight against heart disease.? The Canadian Institutes of Health Research funded the study, which appears in PLOS ONE. Source: McGill University The post Bile acid might prevent deadly heart ?scars? appeared first on Futurity.",0

Every February, we celebrate Black History Month ? a time to reflect, celebrate, and honor the contributions of African-Americans to our society. We know that achieving and maintaining good health is a long-standing issue for this group, many of whom may experience worse health outcomes in critical areas like heart disease and diabetes. But, we want to focus on the positive and provide consumers with health education materials to support healthy behavior changes! It?s true that the health equity gap has narrowed over time, but there is still significant room for improvement. Here are few things that the FDA and the Office of Minority Health (OMH) have done over the past year to reduce health disparities. Public Engagement: More than 29.2 million blacks/African-Americans are on social media ? and we want to meet consumers where they are. So we?re using Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms and electronic communications (e.g. our newsletter and e-blasts) to educate African- Americans on issues such as heart disease, diabetes, and sickle cell disease among others, and also provide tangible solutions to help manage these chronic conditions. For example, to mark American Heart Month in February, we developed a social media toolkit to help our stakeholders engage with their members and partnered with the Association of Black Cardiologists to spearhead an #ILoveMyHeart social media campaign. Stakeholder Engagement: We have cultivated relationships with a core set of partners to better understand their health needs, aligned our priorities to meet those needs, and worked together to leverage each other?s resources for the common good. By doing so, we?ve increased our stakeholder?s capacity to communicate with the agency on regulatory issues. For example, multicultural stakeholders are now better able to make their voice heard in FDA-sponsored public meetings and on open dockets. Minority Health Research: We worked with academia to fund African-American-based research projects (e.g. HIV/AIDs and triple negative breast cancer) and research fellows working on topics like genomics and digital communications. This allows us to increase the knowledge base on these issues and ensure a diverse workforce is in place to solve these complex health problems. Resources: We have taken care to tailor our health education resources, such as infographics and fact sheets, to African Americans. Our website has valuable information on sickle cell disease and lupus, both of which affect African Americans more than any other racial/ethnic group. Clinical Trial Diversity: Did you know that sometimes minority populations may respond differently to medical products? One example is an FDA-approved heart failure medication that reduces the risk of death and hospitalization in people with certain types of long-lasting/chronic heart failure. During clinical trials, it was found there was an increased risk of an allergic reaction called angioedema in blacks. In this trial, only 5% of the participants were black, even though blacks represent 13% of the U.S. population and experience heart failure at rates higher than the rest of the population. This is why we continue to work toward increasing clinical trial diversity, to ensure that medical products are safe and effective for everyone! President Obama has said, ?If you?re walking down the right path and you?re willing to keep walking, eventually you?ll make progress.? OMH will continue walking down the path to improving health equity and we want you to join us, because this work cannot be done alone.

Rising incidences of acute and chronic diseases all over the world is the main factor that drives the market for hospital pharmaceuticals. Hospital pharmaceuticals do not include any type of skilled nursing facilities. Such drugs that fall within the hospital pharmaceuticals category could be anything from pain killers or drugs prescribed for easing minor aches and pains to drugs that are prescribed for chronic and serious diseases such as cancer, blood pressure, and diabetes. In the United States, an approximate US$200 million is spent annually on purchase of several pharmaceutical products via pharmacies. Besides hospitals and clinics, hospital pharmaceuticals are also sold through several other distribution channels such as mail orders and retail outlets. Browse Full Report With TOC: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/hospital-pharmaceuticals-market.html According to a report published by Transparency Market Research, the global hospital pharmaceuticals market is expected to decline at 11.5% CAGR between 2014 and 2020, thereby reporting a value of US$10,907.5 million by 2020 from US$26,580.9 million in 2013. Why Are Anti-Cholinergic Agents Losing Market Share? The global hospital pharmaceuticals market is segmented on the basis of key therapeutic cases, indication, and geography. On the basis of therapeutic cases, the global hospital pharmaceuticals market is categorized into infection, pain, neurology, nephrology and urology, oncology, and cardiology. The market for neurology is further classified into antipsychotic drugs, anti-anxiety agents, antidepressant drugs, and anti-migraine drugs. Based on indications, the global market for hospital pharmaceuticals is also segmented into nephrology and urology, oncology, cardiology, pain, infection, and neurology. The nephrology and urology segment covers illnesses such as acute kidney failure, diabetes, glomerular diseases, and chronic kidney diseases. Oncology segment covers different types of cancers such as prostrate, colorectal, lung, and breast. The cardiology segment is categorized into heart failure, high blood pressure, and stroke. Cancer pain, neuropathic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis are the different categories under the pain segment. The segment for infection is further sub-segmented into amebiasis, tuberculosis, candida infection, fungal meningitis, and others. In 2013, the oncology segment held the highest share in the overall hospital pharmaceuticals market, followed by the segment for cardiovascular diseases. With the cardiovascular segment, the anti-cholinergic agent is exhibiting a rapidly declining rate of growth. This can be attributed to the loss of exclusivity of fast selling medications and drugs such as Enablex and VESIcare. What Drives the Hospital Pharmaceuticals Market in Emerging Economies? Geographically, the global hospital pharmaceuticals market is segmented into Asia Pacific, North America, Europe, and Rest of the World. The largest market share in the global hospital pharmaceuticals market is held by North America. However, as per industry trends and market forecasts, it is anticipated that Asia Pacific will witness robust growth during the forecast period. The anticipated expansion of this regional market can be attributed to factors such as rising incidence of cardiovascular anomalies and cancer cases, and rapidly growing population in emerging economies of Asia Pacific. The hospital pharmaceuticals markets of Latin America, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa are essentially propelled by substantial growth of medical tourism. It is expected that these regions will also be driven by other factors such as greater awareness about branded medications and drugs and greater proliferation of hospitals in the forthcoming years.The leading companies operating in the global hospital pharmaceuticals market are Sanofi ?Aventis Bayer AG, Eli Lilly and Company, Pfizer, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson, and Merck & Co., Inc.

BLOG,http://thelowcarbdiabetic.blogspot.com,http://thelowcarbdiabetic.blogspot.com/2016/05/for-good-health-say-cheese-please_17.html,5/17/2016,0.694444444,42508.09028,"For Good Health; Say ?Cheese,? Please!","Cheese 101; or why the French were right The command ?Say cheese,? is a phrase so commonly used to elicit a smile that today it is understood from the simple imperative; ?Cheese!? But prior to the 1940s, such photographic cajolery was unknown. Indeed, in the preceding Victorian era the desirable beauty standard was considered a tightly pursed orbicularis oris muscle. Whether because of poor dentition, or the prim and proper societal norms of the time, or some combination of both; smiles were only for children, peasants and drunks. And until very recently, the prevailing conventional wisdom for healthy eating relegated consuming cheese to a failing of the ignorant, simple or misguided. From the late 1940s through the 1970s there was a mandate from the experts and powers that be to consume less fat and particularly saturated fat; principally those derived from animal sources such as meat, poultry and dairy. That admonishment has continued to echo and drive our poor culinary choices over the ensuing half-century like an unresolved daddy issue. An uncomplicated historical glance would have revealed that a modest, living, fermented food like real cheese had helped sustain and advance human kind across civilizations and across the globe. While a large portion of the world?s population is lactose intolerant and therefore unable to consume or potentially benefit from raw or fresh milk products; cheeses and particularly aged cheeses are an exception. The milk sugar, or lactose is utilized by beneficial bacteria; Lactobacillus comes to mind. Along with the fats, most of which are saturated, and proteins, and through the process of fermentation; raw milk undergoes the transformation from raw milk product to cheese. As certain cheeses age, there is often less lactose present; so much so that for many ? even those who are lactose intolerant and unable to tolerate fresh milk? such delicious pillows of probiotic loaded goodness can be enjoyed. For the last half century, real cheeses have been discounted as part of a healthful approach to eating primarily because of their saturated fat and cholesterol content. While the Mediterranean diet was promoted as an ideal dietary model, the dairy aspect of this gastronomy was shoved into a corner where it lingered and mouldered. Often unappreciated, is the historical fact that fermented dairy had a long and prominent place in ancient diets such as the Mediterranean. This is because while fresh milk can be consumed, it is quite perishable and much more valuable as a raw material. Raw milk can be turned into several products like cream, butter, yogurts, kefir, whey and cheese; all of which have a substantially longer shelf life. Cheese reemerged from the shadows with the insights gleaned from the French paradox of the 1990s. The French, who drank wine and consumed butter, cream and over 100 different kinds of cheese, most of which are oh-so-stinky good; all these tasty bits that were verboten in the US at the time, had significantly less cardiovascular disease. It turns out it was more than the wine. A dietary approach like Mediterranean style cuisine, rich in natural, wholesome, and fermented foods, has been shown to reduce generalized inflammation and stress. Oxidative stress and inflammation play major roles in the onset and development of the diabetes and its precursor, metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed by the presence of central obesity and at least two of the following four additional factors: high triglycerides, low HDL or ?good? cholesterol, high blood pressure, or increased fasting plasma glucose concentration. Data from the recent European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study examined 16,835 healthy and 12,403 diabetic participants from 8 European nations. The researchers found an inverse association between cheese, fermented dairy consumption, and the incidence of diabetes. Eating only 55 g/d total of cheese and/or yogurt was associated with a 12% reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. A new study just released revealed that just 30 g daily of a Parmesan-like Italian cheese, Grana Padano, lowered blood pressure as effectively as the typically prescribed antihypertensive pharmaceutical. This occurred, even though the cheese contained the equivalent amount of sodium that would be found in consuming a 1 ounce serving of potato chips. Previous studies had isolated some particular tripeptides in certain types of cheese and demonstrated a relationship to being able to lower blood pressure. These particular compounds are formed through the interaction of human gastrointestinal enzymes and the gut microbiota. These peptide complexes have angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibiting properties. Such ACE inhibitors constitute an important class of medications that not only lower blood pressure, but are a foundation of therapy from those suffering from cardiomyopathy or congestive heart failure from a variety of causes. Another study examined almost 20,000 participants. It examined the association between cheese consumption in various age groups and circulating concentrations of HDL or ?good? cholesterol and triglycerides, a negative risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The more cheese consumed the higher the HDL and the lower the triglycerides. The researchers suggested that this was the result of the particular fatty acid composition of cheese and its inherent, probiotic, bacterial content. The high protein and probiotic content of cheese is also believed to contribute to its almost neutral effect on plasma cholesterol. Even though cheese is high in cholesterol and saturated fat, like so many other such natural foodstuffs, its impact on blood lipids and total cholesterol is negligible. Some kinds of cheeses, namely those infected with Penicillium such as Roquefort, Stilton, or Gorgonzola, exhibit high concentrations of andrastins A, B, C, and D. These are potent inhibitors of the enzyme farnesyltransferase. This enzyme plays a key role in cholesterol synthesis and its inhibition decreases cholesterol production. In fact, while the total cholesterol is overall minimally unchanged, some studies suggest that consuming these types of foods shift the cholesterol towards the less inflammatory, less atherogenic type. An interesting observation arises from these studies. The decrease in oxidative stress and inflammation markers is independent of body weight. Eating fat does not make you fat. Nor are the benefits simply the result of losing weight or caloric considerations. The healthful effects also occur quite rapidly which suggests not just a correlation, but a causation. Oligosaccharides which are also present in cheeses are prebiotics. This is the food that sustains a healthy gut microbiota. It is what feeds the wee beasties. Cheeses, which contain both prebiotics and probiotics become that gut microbiome superfood; a synbiotic. Another recently completed study demonstrated the cheese consumption directly altered the gut microbiome in an extremely favorable way. Certain gut bacteria are associated with the production of a compound known as trimethylamine?N?oxide or TMAO. The bacteria produce this compound in response to the dietary ingestion of choline. Levels of TMAO have been found to correlate and are directly predictive of cardiovascular risk. The consumption of cheese rapidly altered the composition of the gut microbiome. There was significantly less TMAO produced. The positive changes to the gut microbiome associated with the regular consumption of such a powerful, wholesome, naturally fermented, synbiotic food as cheese may explain the relatively low incidence of cardiovascular disease in high cheese consumption countries. Canned smiles and canned cheese don?t cut it. For that unique stinky goodness and real wellbeing, only real cheese is the real deal. Smile, and cut the cheese. https://www.psychologytoday.com/ Graham",0

""Rock Bottom"" Hello World, I'm Jay Bee & this is the Me Against Me Project Blog. (Get ready for run-on sentences) Should you look around you'll notice that this isn't the first blog entry for my project, but it will be my final attempt (a last do-over, if you will) to overcome my many issue's while chronicling my journey in an effort to showcase the seriousness of these issue's, the reality of what Binge Eating Disorder looks like, that it's real, the physical repercussions of having B.E.D., the confusion of trying to figure out the best way to get healthy, the overpowering stress of it all, and the sometimes lack of available help to treat and defeat my particular forms of mental & physical illness. See? I warned you about run-on sentences. Get ready for more. I am completely worn out, mentally/physically/spiritually, from my dealings with mental illness for what feels like forever. I've tried so many times to get healthy, and having ultimately failed EVERY single time, another failure will most like result in... well, let's not think of that right now. Considering how young I am, it's crazy to think of just how sick, weak, and old I feel. Some of the stuff I am dealing with physically doesn't usually occur in people until they are much older and have lived a long life of beating themselves up with poor diet, drinking, and smoking. With my mental health issues and the resulting physical problems that stem from never overcoming those issues, I exist within an incredibly dangerous combination of crap - perfect for an early death. The Great List of Issue's: Binge Eating Disorder (B.E.D.) Panic Disorder (Kinda like having anxiety problems, but this version is constant and relentless in it's pursuit to rob you of any sort of peace and happiness. You become a distant sort of robot. Chronic Depression (When you're happy you're normal, when you're sad you're VERY sad. Morbidly Obese - Weighing as much as 400 lbs. Massive List of Physical Issues Due To So Many Years of Battling Food Addiction, Extreme Weight Changes & the Constant Stress from Everything Mentioned Above: Type 2 Diabetes (The only time I'm happy to settle for not being number one) Sleep Apnea Slightly Enlarged Heart (Due to the sleep apnea, morbid obesity, and diabetes) High Blood Pressure (Constantly dizzy, light-headed) Highly Inflammatory Body (in the danger zone for heart attack & stroke) Extreme Acid Reflux (weakened and inflamed throat/esophagus, sinus airways, lungs from choking on acid in my sleep - super fun way to wake up in the middle of the night) Skin Disorder (developed from poor diet, high sugar in blood; psoriasis-like) Vision Issues (high blood pressure and diabetes are making my vision fade quickly) Bone/Joint Issues (hips popping out randomly, tightness everywhere, straight neck, compressed lower back - it all causes lots of numbness, inability to move without pain or just not being able to move at all) Back Muscle Issues (Lower back gets strained/pulled constantly - can't move, can't walk) Constantly Winded/Feeling Sick (I'm always out of breath and feel dizzy or sick - just talking makes me winded sometimes) Flushed Face/Feels Hot (Face always looks oddly red and flushed, in comparison to the rest of my body & around my eyes, and my face always feels hot and somewhat numb to the touch) Persistent Liver/Gallbladder Pains Something is going on in my Liver/Gallbladder/Pancreas area. The area is painful most of the time now, and I have symptoms of some scary stuff going on.Honestly, there are probably more issue's than that but whatever. You get the idea. At this point, the deck is definitely stacked against me. The odds of a full recovery are not in my favor. I'm sure if you're of a more rational and sane mind you're probably thinking, ""How the hell did you let yourself get that sick, that fat, that unhealthy?"". Well, that's what makes all of this so tricky. It's the necessary part of B.E.D. & Food Addiction(which mental health professionals still won't officially say exists) that makes them bonafide mental illnesses; you can't overcome them alone and/or you have to reach your own version of rock bottom to truly be able to get better. Even if you have moments where you can kinda see it, like that guy in the Predator movie ""...There's something in those trees"", you can try to get healthy, lose weight & work out, but ultimately you fail. You usually gain even more weight than before, along with new accompanying physical problems that make a sedentary lifestyle feel most comfortable, and your B.E.D./Food Addiction gains a much greater hold over you. You fall into an even deeper and darker hole, and you feel almost powerless to try and overcome yourself/your disease. I have tried so many times to figure out this puzzle. Up until almost two years ago, there was virtually no help for someone with Binge Eating Disorder. It was just recently officially recognized as a mental illness (Important Side Note: Doctors can be really dumb so beware). If you were going to get any help at all you had to be assigned an illness you didn't actually have (They diagnosed me as Bulimic even though I told them I never vomit) or you had to pay out of pocket for an EXTREMELY expensive treatment facility BUT the chances of that fancy facility accepting males was virtually ZERO. So if you were a guy with B.E.D. you were basically screwed. Now things are a little different since B.E.D. was officially claimed as a mental illness. There are a couple commercials about B.E.D. (One of which is specifically trying to sell you some poisoned pills - I'll get into that another time), there's a nice website called NEDA that offers some assistance to those looking to find help for B.E.D. (Though there was no place near me when I last checked), and health insurance has to accept your claim of being mentally ill now & thus provide you with assistance getting help. As for me; I am at a place where I've finally accepting that I can not, in any way, overcome my illness without SERIOUS help from mental health professionals. I've actually always known that, but until recently I never had a way to GET the help that I so desperately needed. Where I mean I'm finally accepting that I am helpless is in the following; I've been trying to get myself ""clean"" by getting on a healthy cleanse diet and overcoming the intense physical withdrawals I feel when I stop eating sugary and bad-carb foods. For me, Food Addiction is no joke. I get very sick for nearly a week with some wicked physically/mental withdrawals. For the last four months, each time I've attempted this diet I have failed. I have allowed that failure to hold myself back from admitting myself into an Eating Disorder clinic. This is where I am giving in. I see that the self-sabotage part of my mind has been holding me back with this need to get ""clean"" before entering treatment. It's been kind of a convenient excuse for the repetitive binge-inducing diet failure I've been repeating for the last few months. Now, no more prepping for my admittance to treatment. Tomorrow I will be in contact with an Eating Disorder clinic to set up my admittance ASAP. So there it is. Now we're all basically on the same page. You know exactly what all I'm dealing with. Over the next however long it takes to get healthy, I'll be posting daily blogs, regular vlogs on my YouTube channel, and random thought/updates/etc. on Facebook & Twitter. I'll include the links to everything on this page, so feel free to follow along, like, subscribe, and all that good stuff. If you or anyone you know is struggling with Binge Eating Disorder be sure to go to NEDA to find some helpful info and a free hotline to call. As for following along with my project, maybe you'll discover something that helps you find your own way toward getting healthy or at least you'll realize that B.E.D. and Food Addiction are both very real and very dangerous. I'm definitely not doing any of this for popularity. It's actually quite humiliating to share all of this. I hope to be an example for the millions of people that knowingly or unknowingly struggle with what I have, to show how hard it is to exist with B.E.D./Food Addiction, mental illness, and morbid obesity. Hopefully my experiences and brutal honesty, along the way, about what I'm dealing with and going through will help others. Most importantly, this project will show everyone that this isn't a problem that you can fix on your own. You'll need help. To truly recovery from such mental and physical issue's it's going to take multiple health professionals and the assistance of others that are caring and understand you're illness. It takes a community. For me, I realize that I'll have to piece together that community for myself. But at least I still have hope. And that's good enough for now.

There are medications available, but there are also natural alternatives believed to be helpful for the condition. Turmeric is believed to be one of the effective herbal alternatives for water retention. According to experts, the body is made up of 70% water. Water retention may impact different bodily areas and its development may be due to several contributory factors. One of the causes of the condition is when there are changes in the pressure inside the capillaries. It can also develop when the lymphatic system is congested. When this happens, the fluid can't efficiently go back to the bloodstream and can remain in the tissues, which can cause swelling. Congestive heart failure can also cause blood pressure changes, which can result in serious water retention. There are other body organs or parts that can trigger the development of water retention, such as the kidneys. Pregnant women or those with sedentary lifestyle are at a greater risk of the condition. Protein is essential for effective water balance. Protein deficiency is also believed to cause water retention. Inflammation, especially when it persists for a long time, can result in chronic water retention. There are also pharmaceutical medications that can lead to the condition. Individuals who take estrogen-containing drugs or pain relievers such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be at a high risk of the condition. Individuals who suffer from water retention typically experience symptoms such as facial swelling, abdominal bloating, dimpled skin, and puffiness in the legs. There are natural alternatives believed to be helpful for sufferers, such as drinking adequate amounts of water to rehydrate. Sufferers should also exercise regularly and add more fresh produce to their diet. Using turmeric is also thought to be helpful against the condition. Turmeric has been used for thousands of years in Ayurveda and traditional medicine. This spice contains a powerful phytochemical called curcumin. Curcumin contains ingredients that are believed to contain antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties. There are many potential health benefits associated with the use of turmeric. For fluid retention, sufferers may combine turmeric with honey. This is believed to help reduce water retention and may even facilitate achieving a toned and slim body. There are also curcumin supplements available on the market today.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has now approved the combination tablet valsartan/sacubitril (Entresto, Novartis) for the treatment of patients with heart failure[1]. The combination drug, formerly known as LCZ696, is the first approved agent in the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) class and exerts its effect within and beyond the renin-angiotensin system. Chemically, the agent consists of the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan affixed to the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril. The US approval is based on results of the Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ACE-I to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure (PARADIGM-HF) trial, a study reported by heartwire from Medscape when it was presented at the European Society of Cardiology 2014 Congress in Barcelona, Spain. In PARADIGM-HF, a study that included more than 8000 chronic-heart-failure patients, treatment with the valsartan/sacubitril combination significantly reduced cardiovascular death or heart-failure hospitalizations ? the study's primary end point ? by 20% compared with treatment with the ACE inhibitor enalapril alone. All-cause mortality, a secondary end point, was also significantly reduced with the ARNI when compared with enalapril. Entresto was reviewed under the agency's priority review program. The expedited review process is intended for new drugs developed to treat a serious disease or those that provide a significant improvement over existing therapy. In addition, the agency awarded the drug a fast-track designation, a process reserved for new drugs that treat a serious condition, such as heart failure, and filled an unmet medical need. As reported by heartwire , heart-failure experts are enthusiastic about the prospects of the ARNI, believing it represents the future cornerstone of chronic-heart-failure therapy. The new Canadian heart failure guidelines have already been updated and include recommendations on when and how to use the new agent in clinical practice. References 1. Food and Drug Administration.

REMIGIUS NKEM ASHUKE (Medical Practitioner) LAGOS, NIGERIA [/b]It all started about February 2012 and the first symptoms I started experiencing were non-productive cough and chest pain. I consulted with consultant physicians and ENT surgeons at different hospitals and I was subjected to diverse laboratory investigations, all to no avail. I took several X-rays of the chest and did CT scan of both the chest and the neck. TB tests (acid fast bacill and gene expert), echocardiogram, FNAC (fine needle aspirate cytology) and so on, without anyone being able to make any impression that could suggest what was wrong with me. The cancer had already metastasized to other parts of my body while those investigations were being done. On 20th June 2013, I was rushed to LASUTH (Lagos University Teaching Hospital) medical emergency on account of severe breathlessness at abot 7am. I was given emergency medications to relieve the breathlessness and from my arrival here, I began to make use of artificial oxygen which I was on for one full month, while I was being investigated by different medical teams. Within that period, I was placed on anti-TB drugs following a mentuex test that was carried out on me, which came out positive within durations of 16 minutes. It was when I was taken to theatre for bronchoscopy and mediasthnoscopy that the cardio-thoracid team discovered the massive metastatic tumor that had obstructed my trachea at the lower third of the trachea. I was then referred to EKO hospital Ikeja for radiotherapy, I had seven courses of radiotherapy at the hospital and I had six courses of chemotherapy at LASUTH. There was a time my platelet count dropped to one (1) and I was losing blood through my nostrils, mouth and I was urinating frank red blood. It was while I was receiving chemotherapy that a doctor friend of mine (Dr. Emmanuel Nsofor) brought Bell Supreme Immune Booster and Japanese Green Tea to me and I began to use them. It was from that moment that I stopped breaking down after every course of chemotherapy and I began to feel strong within in spite of my wasted exterior. Having realized the efficacy of Bell Products, I started using Curcumin 2000X as well. Apart from strengthening my immunity and helping me to recover from CANCER OF THE LUNGS. I have not been sick since one year ago that I started using the products inspite of the fact that I used to suffer so often from malaria before my contact with Bell Products.

TESTIMONY OF NATUROPATH I am Roman Deguenon, Staff of BCEAO Bank, I was suffering from pain on my back at the vertebra since more than 10 years. It was paining me extremely and when I started I must suffer through for many hours. I went from Clinic to clinic, from doctor to doctor in vain. The pain was becoming atrocious and unbearable. Finally, I was obliged to adopt the bet lambo abdominal. I couldn?t seat down for long time neither stand up for long time. I was convicted to do movement only with car. Then one day, somebody directed me to centre of Naturopath ?NGO BT- I went there and the miracle was done for me. The manager of the centre prescribed 2 BOTTLE OF SHARK CARTILAGE and before I finished the first bottle, I felt that my pains disappeared. When I finished 2 bottles, I did not feel anything again.

One study has shown the benefits of this natural heart helper. Amazingly, coconut water was found to lower the blood pressure of 71% of study participants. Coconut water is a clear, light, liquid that is quite refreshing. Extracted from young, green coconuts that have not reached maturity, coconut water is actually comprised of about 95% water content. In order to locate the proper coconut, look for coconuts that are white, smooth, and pointed on one end. These are not the ?traditional? coconuts you may be used to seeing in the produce section which are brown and covered in small hairs. These young coconuts will be in the refrigerated section, as they are perishable. Coconut Water is Full of Vital Nutrients, Better than Sports DrinksHawaiians actually call coconut water ?noelani,? which means ?dew from the heavens.? The drink is even held in high regard in many tropical cultures. Due to the health-promoting contents of the beverage and the immense hydrating qualities it harnesses, it is no surprise that coconut water is a far better alternative to additive-laden sports drinks. In fact, one 2007 study found sodium-enriched coconut water to be as effective as commercial sports drinks in overall hydration with far less stomach pains. Of course coconut water also surpasses sports drinks due to an impressive nutritional profile, including: Essential B vitamins, minerals, and trace elements (such as zinc, selenium, iodine, sulfur, and manganese). The 5 essential electrolytes (potassium, sodium, phosphorous, magnesium, calcium). Cytokinins, which are plant hormones that can fight against cancer and aging. Amino acids, organic acids, enzymes, antioxidants, and phytonutrients.Perhaps the most compelling reason to drink coconut water is the fact that it reduced blood pressure in 71% of those who drank it. Hypertension can lead to stroke, myocardial infraction, heart failure, and much more. Beyond that, it is a leading cause of chronic kidney failure. Instead of taking pharmaceutical drugs riddled with side effects, coconut water presents itself as a powerful hypertension solution without the harsh side effects.",0

Low levels of total vitamin D and bioavailable vitamin D can help predict a person?s risk of major adverse cardiovascular events such as a heart attack, stroke, heart failure or death, according to a first-of-its-kind study from the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Salt Lake City. ?Our study found that low levels of both total vitamin D and bioavailable vitamin D appear to be associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes,? said lead author Heidi May, PhD, MSPH, a cardiovascular epidemiologist with the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute. The study evaluated 4,200 participants between the ages of 52 and 76. A quarter of the study participants were diabetic and 70 percent had coronary artery disease. Clinicians tested participants? vitamin D metabolite levels, which included components of vitamin D that are formed during metabolism, to determine the metabolites? association with future major adverse cardiovascular events. Bioavailable vitamin D results from vitamin D being absorbed into the blood stream without binding to surrounding proteins. During metabolism, only 10?15 percent of total vitamin D is available in the body to act on target cells, as most are bound to vitamin D binding proteins. Therefore, evaluating whether the proportion of vitamin D that can be used may be important, as only unbound vitamin D, such as bioavailable vitamin D, is available to act on target cells. The study tested many different types of vitamin D, but found that measuring total vitamin D and bioavailable vitamin D were the most accurate in predicting harmful cardiovascular events. ?This study is the first research that evaluates the association of vitamin D metabolites with cardiovascular events,? said Dr. May. ?And evaluating usable vitamin D could mean the difference on the amount of vitamin D prescribed, if it?s prescribed at all.? The study expands on the results of several observational studies, including some performed at Intermountain Healthcare, but researchers recommend conducting more studies on non-Caucasian populations because past research shows vitamin D metabolites affect Caucasian and non-Caucasian races differently. Other members of the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute research team included Oxana Galenko, PhD, John F. Carlquist, PhD, Lindell K.

This has created a big headache for Novartis, which is leaning heavily on Entresto and another new drug, Cosentyx, to blunt the impact of its blockbuster cancer drug Gleevec losing patent protection in February. ?Entresto?s sluggish performance is puzzling, given thatcardiologists agree the drug marks a rare breakthrough in medicine for heart-failure? Milton Packer, one of the cardiologists who co-led the Entresto trial, said that while the drug had stoked ?enormous excitement? among cardiologists, they needed time to debate and digest the results before starting to use it in large numbers. He noted that the introduction of beta blockers in the 1990s ?changed the entire landscape of the treatment of heart failure, but it took about five to 10 years.? ?Another reason for the lackluster launch: Until recently, many patients? health plans didn?t cover the drug, priced at $12.50 a day before discounts.

As Roj Blake in the cult series, the Welsh actor led a group of rebels on their Liberator space ship against an evil federation that ruled the galaxy. Thomas was also an accomplished stage actor who appeared in several Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) productions. His later television appearances include playing Nathaniel Clegghorn in ITV's Heartbeat and David Baddiel's father in Sky's Baddiel's Syndrome. Born in 1945, Thomas attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in the 1960s and later became a Rada associate. His roles at the RSC included Orsino in Twelfth Night, Cassio in Othello and Mat Burke in Eugene O'Neill's Anna Christie. Yet he remains best known for Blake's 7, which ran on BBC One from 1978 to 1981. At its peak, the series was watched by 10 million viewers and was sold to 40 countries. Thomas claimed never to have watched a single episode of the show, which was derided by some for its shaky sets and basic special effects. The show also had a distinctly pessimistic tone - typified by the final episode, in which all the main characters were apparently killed off. Reports of the actor's death began to circulate after a Blake's 7 fan site announced he had died on Wednesday from heart failure. ""Our thoughts are with his wife Linda, and his family and friends,"" the message continued. His death was confirmed by a friend who worked on a Blake's 7 remake, according to the Press Association. Fans, friends and former colleagues have been paying their respects on Twitter, among them an actress who said she had appeared with him on stage in Salisbury. ""Our characters hated each other but he was a lovely actor and a lovely man,"" tweeted Ruth Mitchell. Scottish broadcaster Muriel Gray, meanwhile, said she had ""adored"" Thomas and called the news ""miserable"".",0

Dr Klaus Witte, from Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, led the study, known as VINDICATE. He said: ""This is a significant breakthrough for patients. It is the first evidence that vitamin D3 can improve heart function of people with heart muscle weakness ? known as heart failure. ""These findings could make a significant difference to the care of heart failure patients."" Vitamin D3 can be boosted by exposure to sunlight, but heart failure patients are often deficient in it even during the summer because older people make less vitamin D3 in response to sunlight than younger people, the study authors said. Vitamin D3 production in the skin is also reduced by sunscreen. The study, which was funded by the Medical Research Council, involved more than 160 patients from Leeds who were already being treated for their heart failure using proven treatments including beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors and pacemakers. Participants were asked to take vitamin D3 or a dummy (placebo) tablet for one year. Those patients who took vitamin D3 experienced an improvement in heart function which was not seen in those who took a placebo. Changes in heart function were measured by cardiac ultrasound. Heart specialists measure heart function by taking an ultrasound scan of the heart (known as an echocardiogram) and measuring how much blood pumps from the heart with each heartbeat, known as ejection fraction. The ejection fraction of a healthy person is usually between 60% and 70%. In heart failure patients, the ejection fraction is often significantly impaired ? in the patients enrolled into the VINDICATE study the average ejection fraction was 26%. In the 80 patients who took Vitamin D3, the heart?s pumping function improved from 26% to 34%. In the others, who took placebo, there was no change in cardiac function. This means that for some heart disease patients, taking vitamin D3 regularly may lessen the need for them to be fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), a device which detects dangerous irregular heart rhythms and can shock the heart to restore a normal rhythm. ""ICDs are expensive and involve an operation"" said Dr Witte. ""If we can avoid an ICD implant in just a few patients, then that is a boost to patients and the NHS as a whole."" One key aspect of this study is that the researchers avoided using a calcium-based supplement, as calcium can cause further problems for heart failure patients. Heart failure affects about 900,000 people in the UK and more than 23 million worldwide. The condition can affect people of all ages, but it is more common in older people ? more than half of all people globally with heart failure are over the age of 75. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

After a few months of rest and recovery, he?s now back at school, returned to the gym and is spending quality time with his friends. Danny shares what he?s learned throughout his experience with cardiomyopathy and heart failure. All in all, life?s been really great. I went back to school four weeks ago. Getting back into the work was a bit tough at first ? I had been doing one hour of tutoring a day, and now I?m in school six hours a day! But I?m getting used to it. I?m basically doing everything I used to, and it?s nice to be back in that routine. It got kind of boring sitting at home all the time while my friends were at school, but I had friends over on the weekends. And it made me appreciate the little things more. Being at home with family ? that?s really important. ?A new normal? Life?s pretty much back to normal, but it?s a new normal. I have to take medications every day, which is new, but not too complicated. I just bring a water bottle with me to school and take my pills after class. We all have alarms on our phones, the whole family. So I see the alarm, and then a few seconds later I get a text from my mom. As for follow-up appointments in Boston, I?ve gotten used to the long drive. I sleep most of the way. We have to leave the house around 4 a.m. for a 7 a.m. appointment in Boston. At first, the appointments were twice a week; then once a week; then twice a month; and now I go once a month. People ask me lots of questions. One I get a lot is: ?Have your taste buds changed at all?? Apparently, that can happen a lot to transplant recipients. But I haven?t noticed any strange new cravings yet! I also am restricted from drinking alcohol and eating grapefruit. Since I?m not old enough to drink, that doesn?t really affect me much, and I don?t really like grapefruit. Although now that I can?t have it anymore, I kind of want one. Looking ahead It?s great to be working up a sweat again, but I know I can never play football all out again like I used to. I may be able to be a kicker on our team next fall, though, and I?m discovering new sports to try, like golf, paddle tennis and basketball. I?ll be a senior next year, so I?m just starting to look at colleges. I?m not sure what I will study just yet, but I?m pretty artistic, so I?m thinking about architecture. I?m not tied down to this region, which is great, because I?ve been looking as far out as California. My doctors say I can go to college anywhere I want. ?I want to give back? Throughout this whole process, I?ve learned a lot about cardiomyopathy, heart failure and organ donation. This spring, I will attend the Donate Life gala and am also working with the American Heart Association on promoting awareness of heart disease in young people. When most people think about heart disease, they think about older adults, but it can really affect all ages in a variety of ways. My family also started a fund called Danny Strong that raises money for cardiomyopathy research and patient care at the Boston Children?s Heart Center. I just found out that my heart is in the basement of Boston Children?s Hospital now, as a specimen. It made me feel good because the people there ? Dr. Kevin Daly, Dr. Betsy Blume, all of the nurses in the cardiac intensive care unit ? they?ve given me the best treatment. I want to give back. Learn more about the Cardiomyopathy Program.

God put it in my heart when I was just a child. It wasn?t until 3 years ago that he turned that tiny inkling in to a burning desire and we starting looking for her. I had been receiving emails from our adoption agency regularly with bios and pictures of waiting kids in china but it wasn?t until late one Saturday night that I saw her face. I opened up an email fully expecting to glance at it and then hit delete when I saw her. Her name was Audrey. She was 4 years old and had a congenital heart defect. That?s all I knew that at moment and that?s all I needed. I immediately sent the email to my husband who was working 3rdshift. He answered right away with a simple ?cute as a button lets go get her?. I requested more info from our agency and tried to understand her condition as best I could. She was born with tetralogy of fallot and had surgery to repair it at around 1 year. She had some delays but other wise seemed fine. Little did we know God was just protecting us and giving us just enough info at the time. He knew just what we needed to say YES to this child and I?m so glad we did. 17 days after bringing her home we went to the cardiologist for a ?checkup?. However? that checkup turned into a month long hospital stay. We found out that day that she was in heart failure and needed surgery immediately. Her heart was so bad that our doctors were not even sure how things would go. But God knew? She came through that surgery like a champ and never even needed the ecmo machine (which they told us she would). It was the coming days turned into weeks turned into months that were the hardest. Her heart had been so bad for so long that the rest of her body had no idea how to respond. CVICU became out new home. I?m not going to lie?. it sucked. There were days when we wondered if she would ever open her eyes again but even in the midst of that I knew she was worth it. If she never walked out of that hospital again I knew? she was worth it all. Looking back now I can see just how God was with us each step of the way. And more importantly how he was with Audrey. He kept her alive for 5 years while she waited for her family. He kept that desire burning in my heart until I found her. People often say to me ?you saved her life? but I can honestly say no, she saved mine. My faith is stronger than it has ever been. She has shown me what it means to be an overcomer. She is brave. She is mighty. She is stubborn as all get out and I wouldn?t trade her for the world. She is our daughter. God knew long before I ever did. He was just waiting on me to step out of the boat. Don?t let the fear of the unknown keep you from saying yes to a child. God is bigger than all of it and all you have to do is trust him. www.laurastoutphotography.com",0

According to the press release, under the agreement, St. Jude Medical shareholders will receive $46.75 in cash and 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, representing total consideration of approximately $85 per share. At an Abbott stock price of $43.93(2), this represents a total transaction equity value of $25 billion. The deal has a $685 million termination fee which may come in handy if Congress decides to intervene and block the deal. According to Abbott ""The combined company will have an industry-leading pipeline expected to deliver a steady stream of new medical device products across cardiovascular, diabetes, vision and neuromodulation patient care."" This is how Abbott justified the transaction: St. Jude Medical's strong positions in heart failure devices, atrial fibrillation and cardiac rhythm management complement Abbott's leading positions in coronary intervention and transcatheter mitral repair. Together, the company will compete in nearly every area of the cardiovascular market and hold the No. 1 or 2 positions across large and high-growth cardiovascular device markets. This best-in-class combined portfolio will have the depth, breadth and innovation to help patients restore their health, reduce costs for payors and deliver greater value to customers. ""Bringing together these two great companies will create a premier medical device business and immediately advance Abbott's strategic and competitive position,"" said Miles D. White, chairman and chief executive officer, Abbott. ""The combined business will have a powerful pipeline ready to deliver next-generation medical technologies and offer improved efficiencies for health care systems around the world."" ""Today's announcement is an exciting next chapter for St. Jude Medical, bringing together two industry leaders with a shared passion for innovation, culture and patients,"" said Michael T. Rousseau, St. Jude Medical president and chief executive officer. ""Our combined scale will expand the global reach, competitiveness and impact of our medical device innovation for physicians and hospitals. This transaction provides our shareholders with immediate value and the opportunity to participate in the significant upside potential of the combined organization. I'd like to thank our 18,000 employees whose hard work and commitment help us deliver leading medical technologies to patients around the world."" Regarding the financial impact of the transaction, ""the acquisition of St. Jude Medical is expected to be accretive to Abbott's adjusted earnings per share in the first full year after closing and increasing thereafter, with approximately 21 cents of accretion in 2017 and 29 cents in 2018.(1) The combination is anticipated to result in annual pre-tax synergies of $500 million by 2020, including both sales and operational benefits. One-time deal-related costs and integration costs will be provided at a future date."" Translation: St. Jude 18,000 employees are about to be ""synergized"" by a few more thousand jobs lower. St. Jude Medical's net debt of approximately $5.7 billion will be assumed or refinanced by Abbott. Abbott intends to fund the cash portion of this transaction with medium- and long-term debt. Perhaps most surprising about the deal is the absence of Goldman anywhere among the advisors: Evercore is serving as the lead financial advisor for Abbott with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz serving as legal counsel. BofA Merrill Lynch will be providing financing and also is serving as a financial advisor to Abbott. Guggenheim Securities is acting as financial advisor and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP is serving as legal counsel to St. Jude Medical.",0

S3 if new and not previously diagnosed may indicate ventricular dysfunction caused by fluid volume excess, renal insufficiency, valvular regurgitation, etc. So, for me to share with the nurse that I auscultated an S3, should have grabbed her attention to listen to the patient again so that appropriate interventions could have been in place. This patient also had +2 bilateral edema. Ok First let me commend you on obviously doing research and being knowledgeable about your patients condition. Ok an S3 is abnormal, yes. Kudos on hearing that lub dub dub. What interventions should have been in place? Had the patient had an echo? What was the EF? What past medical history do they have? What was their admitting diagnoses? Really if the patient was admitted with CHF or had a history I really wouldn't bat an eye about an S3. Charted it yes but got worked up enough to call a doctor, no. It's expected. I'd be more concerned about lung sounds. Don't hang a floor nurse out because you found something you think she didn't address. She may not have time to explain she understands your concern but the Team is aware. Students in my past working experience sometimes make mountains out of mole hills. Come up to me like they've seen death when the patient they're following has a bloody BM or vomits or says they re in pain. It just creates extra headaches because the patients read the students face and get freaked out. Then I have fires to put out.",0

City hospital Frontier Lifeline?s medical science park, Frontier Mediville, is all set to manufacture mechanical artificial hearts in association with a firm in Russia.?We have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with a Russian manufacturer who makes the device, Sputnik, to manufacture artificial hearts. These hearts, also known as left ventricular assistive devices, are generally used in cases of heart failure, where patients are awaiting a transplant.They help pump blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The latest such device, the ?HeartMate 3?, manufactured in the United States costs around Rs. 90 lakh. We are hoping to manufacture such a device within Rs. 30 lakh, making it affordable for people in India,? said K. M. Cherian, chairman, Frontier Lifeline, at a press meet on Wednesday. At present, Dr. Cherian said, the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals had given their facility permission to conduct trials, so that manufacture of the devices can begin.The artificial heart will be an implantable device which means the patient can leave the hospital while awaiting a transplant, or, in some cases, may not need a transplant at all if the heart recovers, Dr. Cherian said. The hospital will also soon begin phase III of its clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of xenograft valves for the heart -- valves sourced from animals.About 35,000 heart valve replacements are performed annually in the country, said Dr. Cherian. Most of these, he said, use imported mechanical valves, with prices ranging from Rs. 50,000.TTK Chitra, an indigenous mechanical heart valve, which is cheaper, is used too, but mechanical valves, Dr. Cherian said, require life-long anti-coagulation, necessitating frequent blood testing.The hospital?s heart valve trial involves biological and bioprosthetic valves which do not require anti-coagulation and do not have sudden failures like mechanical valves, making them more desirable, he said. The biological prostheses are of three kinds: the porcine pulmonary artery, the bovine jugular vein and the bovine pericardium, said Dr. Cherian. These valves are harvested from abattoirs in Hyderabad and Kerala, with sterile precautions and have now been used in 600 patients in phase II of the hospital?s clinical trials, he said. ?Over 90 per cent of them are alive and doing well,? he said. Phase III of the trial will be multi-centric, with the valves supplied by the hospital used in surgeries at AIIMS, New Delhi, and PGI, Chandigarh, involving a total of 50 trial subjects. If all goes well, the hospital will begin commercial manufacture of these valves and they will cost around Rs. 25,000, said Dr. Cherian.The hospital is also in collaboration with Georgia Institute of Technology, US, to develop an indigenous bioprosthetic heart valve. Scientists from the Institute will train Mediville staff to manufacture this. ??. ??.??. ????????? ??????????? ?????????? ????????????? ?????????????? ????????? ????? ??????? ???? ???????? ???????? ??????????????????. 1957??? ?????????????????????? ???????? ????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????? ???????? ??????????? ???? ?????????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????? ??????? ????? ????????????. ??? ?????????? ???????????????? ??. ??.??. ????????? ??????????????? ?????? ??????? ?????????????, ??????? ???? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????? ???????????????? ?????????????????? ????? ?????. ?????, ??????? ????????????????????????? ??????? ?????????? ??? ?????????? ??? ????? ?????????? ????????????? ?????????????? 30 ????? ??? ???????? ?????????????? ????????????????? ???????. ??????????? ????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????? ??????? ????? ?????? ????????? ????????????? ?????????????? ??????????? ????????? ????????????????.

We examined the incidence of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline, heart failure, and cardiac death following STS diagnosis among adults, using Danish patient registries and medical record review. Patients and methods: LVEF decline was examined in a regional cohort of STS patients diagnosed during 1997?2011 in Western Denmark for whom cardiac imaging data were available. LVEF decline was defined as an absolute decline from baseline to follow-up of 10% or more, or, where baseline imaging was not available, a decline below the lower limit of normal (or 40%) for a follow-up LVEF. Heart failure and cardiac death were investigated in a national Danish cohort of all STS patients diagnosed from 2000 to 2009. We followed patients from STS diagnosis until heart failure, cardiac death, emigration or December 31, 2012 (whichever occurred first). Results: The incidence rate of LVEF decline for the regional cohort with follow-up data (N=100, five events) or baseline and follow-up measurements (N=75, 19 events) was 16.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.0?40.3) and 108 (95% CI: 69?170), respectively, per 1,000 person-years. In the national cohort (N=1,187), the incidence of heart failure (40 events) and cardiac death (15 events) was 7.3 (95% CI: 5.4?10.0) and 2.7 (95% CI: 1.6?4.5), respectively, per 1,000 person-years. The strongest predictors of heart failure were doxorubicin treatment (hazard ratio [HR] =2.2, 95% CI: 0.5?10.2) and pre-existing cardiovascular disease (HR=6.3, 95% CI: 0.98?40.6). Conclusion: LVEF decline occurred more frequently compared to heart failure or cardiac death in a nationally representative cohort of Danish STS patients.

The anti-diabetic drug p ioglitazone helps to control blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. But new research, published in The BMJ, has found that taking the drug is linked to a 63% increased risk of bladder cancer. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show 1.18 million prescriptions for pioglitazone hydrochloride were dispensed in England in 2014. Researchers wanted to assess the drug after a number of bladder cancer cases were identified among people taking the drug in a trial in 2005. Since then different studies have reported contradictory findings on the subject. They set out to compare pioglitazone to other anti-diabetic drugs. Experts identified 145,806 patients from the UK Clinical Practice Research Database newly treated with anti-diabetic drugs between January 2000 - when p ioglitazone and another medicine from the same class of drug called rosiglitazone first entered the UK market - and July 2013, with follow-up until July 2014. Overall, 622 of these patients received a diagnosis of bladder cancer during the follow-up period. The team of Canadian-based researchers found that compared to other anti-diabetic drugs, pioglitazone was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. T he risk heightened with increasing duration of use and dose, they found. No increased risk was found for rosiglitazone - the drug was withdrawn from use in 2010 due to an increased risk of cardiovascular disorders, including heart attack and heart failure. ""In this large population-based cohort study with up to 14.5 years of follow-up, pioglitazone was associated with an overall 63% increased risk of incident bladder cancer,"" they wrote. Share:",0

Respiratory Disease Respiratory Disease is defined as medical conditions, affecting the breathing organ and tissues including Inflammatory lung disease, Obstructive lung diseases, Restrictive lung diseases, Respiratory tract infections, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli, the nerves and muscles breathing, etc,. Pulmonary vascular disease: Pulmonary arterial hypertension Pulmonary vascular disease is defined as a condition of blood flow to the lung?s artery is blocked suddenly due to a blood clot somewhere in the body, including pulmonary embolism, chronic thromboembolic disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, pulmonary edema, etc. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a subgroup of a specific subgroup of pulmonary hypertension (PH) defined as a condition of slowly progressive disorder as a result of abnormally high blood pressure in the blood vessel, including pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, or pulmonary capillaries, that carries blood from the heart to the lungs due to narrowing in diameter of most of the very small arteries throughout the lungs of that increased resistance to blood flow, leading to right heart failure and death. Because the phrase pulmonary arterial hypertension is long and pulmonary hypertension is a bit shorter the phrase pulmonary hypertension is often used in place of pulmonary arterial hypertension(a).According to statistic, approximately over 1,000 new cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension are diagnosed each year, In the United States alone. The Treatment A. In conventional medicine perspective Treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (group 1 of clinical classification) has been recently characterized by important progresses, particularly in pharmacological therapy. According to the study by Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria, 1. Only until few years ago, patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension were treated with non-specific drugs, such as diuretics and digoxin for right heart failure and calcium-channel blockers in the minority of cases, responders to the acute vasoreactivity test. In addition, use of oral anticoagulant treatment was supported by uncontrolled studies. 2. In the last 15 years (in particular in the last 8 years) different randomized controlled trials assessing the functional, clinical and hemodynamic efficacy of three classes of targeted drugs (prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors) with pulmonary vascular dilating and antiproliferative effects have been performed. a. Treatment starts with general measures (physical activity, fertility control, respiratory tract infection, etc.) and supportive therapy (anticoagulant therapy, diuretics, oxygen, digoxin). Patients who respond to the acute vasoreactivity test (10% of idiopathic form) are treated with high doses of calcium-channel blockers, non-responders with targeted therapies either on monotherapy or combination. b. Usually an oral active drug is initiated and a second compound of a different class is combined in case of non-satisfactory response to the first treatment c. Combination therapy should be performed only in specialized centers with large experience on use of targeted therapies and their relevant side effects. d. In case of failure of medical therapy, possible options are balloon atrial septostomy and/or listing for lung or heart-lung transplantation. As available treatments do not constitute a cure for pulmonary arterial hypertension, further progresses are expected in the near future(37).

I'm on oxygen at night because of nocturnal hypoxemia, and actually gotten so bad trying to do anything during the day I'm wanting to see if my Medicaid would cover a small portable oxygen machine. Always thinking about when and possibly how this or that started and got worse I think I should be tested for fungals, (mold, dust from having chickens,etc.) I've been given the COPD diagnosis and I havent smoked for 30 years. The shortness of breath which is referred on copd sites as ""sob"" set in severely when an anesthesiologist put a lidocain drip into my collarbone after surgery. When I let them know the next morning they had me come in and he immediately removed it, saying it was affecting my diaphram and that if I hadnt come in I would have fallen asleep that night and not woken up. That very week a family doctor mixed up my blood pressure medications and I went into congestive heart failure and I'm still trying to get a handle on that. Its been 2 years of meds to help with that but the damage is done. Still, in the back of my mind, like you, I have to wonder how much possible Lyme co-infections have had a part in all of this.",1

In the third week of March,I went to my primary dr. for annual check up. Did the complete blood work up before. I was experiencing extreme edema in my legs and extreme fatigue. Dr ordered a sleep study. Also said that my PSA was in normal range. Didn't question it. Then dr. did the DRE and said that it felt unusual. Thought he could feel a ""bump"" and that it felt unusually firm. I talked to him about my urinary difficulties so he said he would refer me to a uro dr. So now we are checking for sleep apnea,for the edema. Dr did an EKG there in his office which was normal. So I go to the sleep dr. and long story short I have severe sleep apnea. Get a CPAP machine and hopefully this corrects the edema. Helped with the extreme fatigue but not the edema. Had my appointment with uro moved up. In the mean time went for a echo on my heart that showed Grade 1 left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. This could be a cause for the edema. At this time my mind was on my heart not PC. After the echo Dr. did more blood work to show heart dysfunction or damage which came back neg. No heart issues but still had bad edema. By this time I'm searching for causes of edema because it just wasn't getting better. Found that after ruling out pulmanary issues, heart issues the only other thing that could cause edema was maybe pelvic tumor.Now I'm getting concerned about that possibility. I go to the uro dr. He does the DRE and feels the same thing the primary felt but was concerned about the edema. So he ordered a CT scan. and new blood work with PSA and fPSA% and urine test. He told me that after the CT he would do a cystoscopy. He showed me some happy face chart that showed my odds of cancer. By this time I'm having overload of info coming at me. We are now talking PC cancer! I get the blood work done while my uro dr. takes a weeks vacation. I am able to see my blood results posted to Mychart on the computer, and see PSA -3.46 fpsa-.26 and the ratio 7.6 %. From what my uro had said to me I knew that 3.5 and .26 were borderline according to his standards. But that 7.6 number and the abnormal DRE had me and still has me freaked out.At this time am I supposed to know anything about the protocal for diagnosing PC? I hadn't even heard of a cystoscopy let alone how to say it or what it was.So yes Bozolidat, I wasn't very well versed on the subject of PC and PSA .DRE. fPSA 4.0 3.5 cystoscopy biopsy normal not normal high grade cancer ,low grade cancer, etc ,etc,etc. I am trying to learn as much as I can about this. Have I read any books on PC by an expert? Seriously.That's why I'm here. I've been through this with duodenal cancer and I can tell you all about that. I know margines and cancer grading ,adenomas,villious adenoma tubularvillous adenoma,adenocarcinoma. ""the whipple procedure"" do you know what that is? Did you know you have a duodenum? That's the top third of yor small intestine if you don't. I can tell you about pyloric cancer and bile duct cancer and resection and % of reccurance. I have yearly endoscopy's and they are always cutting something out and doing biopsy.If you ever need to know about duodenal cancer ,God forbid,I can help with that, I've been through it. I live in a town of 30,000. Not a big city. I know from what I've been through and that I am my best advocate.This has all come at me in about one month. Pretty overwhelming. I think I'll just try and relax now and plan on calling my Dr. to arrange a biopsy.And if he poo poo's that then I'll just go somewhere else. I know when I'm getting the brush off and that I need to be proactive. That's just what I've been doing. Thanks for the response. Mark",1

The current labeling strongly recommends against use of metformin in some patients whose kidneys do not work normally. FDA was asked to review numerous medical studies regarding the safety of metformin use in patients with mild to moderate impairment in kidney function, and to change the measure of kidney function in the metformin drug labeling that is used to determine whether a patient can receive metformin. FDA concluded, from the review of studies published in the medical literature, that metformin can be used safely in patients with mild impairment in kidney function and in some patients with moderate impairment in kidney function. FDA is requiring changes to the metformin labeling to reflect this new information and provide specific recommendations on the drug?s use in patients with mild to moderate kidney impairment. FDA is also requiring manufacturers to revise the labeling to recommend that the measure of kidney function used to determine whether a patient can receive metformin be changed from one based on a single laboratory parameter (blood creatinine concentration) to one that provides a better estimate of renal function (i.e., glomerular filtration rate estimating equation (eGFR)). This is because in addition to blood creatinine concentration, the glomerular filtration rate takes into account additional parameters that are important, such as the patient?s age, gender, race and/or weight. See the FDA Drug Safety Communication for additional information, including a data summary and a list of metformin-containing drugs. BACKGROUND: Metformin-containing medicines are available by prescription only and are used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. When untreated, type 2 diabetes can lead to serious problems, including blindness, nerve and kidney damage, and heart disease. Metformin-containing medicines are available as single-ingredient products and also in combination with other drugs used to treat diabetes. The current drug labeling strongly recommends against metformin use in some patients whose kidneys do not work normally because use of metformin in these patients can increase the risk of developing a serious and potentially deadly condition called lactic acidosis, in which too much lactic acid builds up in the blood. RECOMMENDATION: Healthcare professionals should follow the latest recommendations when prescribing metformin-containing medicines to patients with impaired kidney function. Patients should talk to their health care professionals if they have any questions or concerns about taking metformin. The labeling recommendations on how and when kidney function is measured in patients receiving metformin will include the following information: Before starting metformin, obtain the patient?s eGFR. Metformin is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2. Starting metformin in patients with an eGFR between 30-45 mL/minute/1.73 m2 is not recommended. Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment such as the elderly, renal function should be assessed more frequently. In patients taking metformin whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, assess the benefits and risks of continuing treatment. Discontinue metformin if the patient?s eGFR later falls below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2. Discontinue metformin at the time of or before an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure; restart metformin if renal function is stable.

""Cardiovascular Drug Delivery - Technologies, Markets and Companies""? to their offering.? ? ? ? ? (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160330/349511LOGO ) The cardiovascular drug delivery markets are estimated for the years 2015 to 2025 on the basis of epidemiology and total markets for cardiovascular therapeutics. The estimates take into consideration the anticipated advances and availability of various technologies, particularly drug delivery devices in the future. Markets for drug-eluting stents are calculated separately. Role of drug delivery in developing cardiovascular markets is defined and unmet needs in cardiovascular drug delivery technologies are identified.? Cell-selective targeted drug delivery has emerged as one of the most significant areas of biomedical engineering research, to optimize the therapeutic efficacy of a drug by strictly localizing its pharmacological activity to a pathophysiologically relevant tissue system. These concepts have been applied to targeted drug delivery to the cardiovascular system. Devices for drug delivery to the cardiovascular system are also described.? Role of drug delivery in various cardiovascular disorders such as myocardial ischemia, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia is discussed. Cardioprotection is also discussed. Some of the preparations and technologies are also applicable to peripheral arterial diseases. Controlled release systems are based on chronopharmacology, which deals with the effects of circadian biological rhythms on drug actions.A full chapter is devoted to drug-eluting stents as treatment for restenosis following stenting of coronary arteries.Fifteen companies are involved in drug-eluting stents.? New cell-based therapeutic strategies are being developed in response to the shortcomings of available treatments for heart disease. Potential repair by cell grafting or mobilizing endogenous cells holds particular attraction in heart disease, where the meager capacity for cardiomyocyte proliferation likely contributes to the irreversibility of heart failure. Cell therapy approaches include attempts to reinitiate cardiomyocyte proliferation in the adult, conversion of fibroblasts to contractile myocytes, conversion of bone marrow stem cells into cardiomyocytes, and transplantation of myocytes or other cells into injured myocardium.? Advances in molecular pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases have brought gene therapy within the realm of possibility as a novel approach to treatment of these diseases. It is hoped that gene therapy will be less expensive and affordable because the techniques involved are simpler than those involved in cardiac bypass surgery, heart transplantation and stent implantation. Gene therapy would be a more physiologic approach to deliver vasoprotective molecules to the site of vascular lesion. Gene therapy is not only a sophisticated method of drug delivery; it may at time need drug delivery devices such as catheters for transfer of genes to various parts of the cardiovascular system. Selected 82 companies that either develop technologies for drug delivery to the cardiovascular system or products using these technologies are profiled and 80 collaborations between companies are tabulated. The bibliography includes 200 selected references from recent literature on this topic. The report is supplemented with 30 tables and 8 figures.? Key Topics Covered:? 0. Executive Summary 1.

Seven weeks after Kelly Tarlton's underwater world opened he died of heart failure in his sleep in 1984, aged 47. Kelly once said ""We thought how wonderful it would be if the public could experience the sights and things we were experiencing when diving"". I think this means he wanted to share the marvels of the ocean with everyone.

Roller skating, jogging, bike, cross trainer) is not an effective way to burn fat ???? Approx. In the initial stage certainly we see EFFECTS (especially when previously our training plan based mainly on the exercise hand muscles when switching the subsequent TV channels, and the diet was based on the product type fast food), but in the longer term there is a known many people stagnation. WE CARE ABOUT DIET, do not throw in yourself junk food, over time more and more lengthen the sessions first 30 minutes, then an hour and a half later, we give more and more, and the expected effects can not be seen! :( WHY this happens ?? Our body quickly adapts to aerobic training (aerobic), then naturally they cease to be an effective form of reducing excessive body fat. What will EFFICIENT? Definitely interval training! <3 HIIT or High Intensity Interval Training . this training can be based on any kind of weight training or endurance (running, jumping rope, sit-ups, push-ups, etc.) interleave high intensity: 85-90% HR low: 65-75% HR). Simply put. Instead of jogging at a steady pace - we run fast (sprint) to change the march. Perfect for the TABATA! I do not consider myself a great specialist from running, but I confess that in my case definitely theory works in practice! That's what intervals are much more efficient and in addition give me more fun! WHY interval training is superior to aerobic ?? 1. As I mentioned our body easily adapts to aerobic training, while performing interval training we give our body a stimulus, a new impulse, clearance it with the same of homeostasis, which will translate into ACCELERATION metabolic processes and more efficient use of body fat. 2. Training aerobic (oxygen) may promote insulin resistance, while interval training improves insulin sensitivity! (Havas, 2008). And as we know, insulin is currently plague ... :( 3. In this type of training we put much more emphasis on DYNAMICS, SPEED, FITNESS and other characteristics desired for the overall efficiency! 4. And it's practical advantages, what is cool - we are able to achieve BETTER RESULTS in a shorter time! So 20-30 minutes of interval training may be far more effective than aerobic hour session! 5. And the last advantage thesis by Gruszecki, albeit not backed by scientific studies (D), interval training is simply more interesting !!;)) In addition to the advantages concerning the efficient fat burning, interval training have various health benefits! Intervals also suited perfectly in women with the collapse METABOLIC (inability to burn fat, slow metabolic processes and the emergence of subclinical hypothyroidism) But CAUTION! Do interval training is FOR EVERYONE? No. I do not think it is good for beginners. With the improvement in the condition can gradually introduce intervals into your training plan! :) Well, people taking part in marathons or triathlons, which are unlikely to have to burn fat only improve efficiency - in their case, the advantage of aerobic workouts will be a better option :) REFERENCES: Ciolac, Emmanuel G., et al.

The clinical trial found that patients with end-stage heart failure treated with stem cells harvested from their own bone marrow had 37 percent fewer heart than those who received a placebo events. ""In the last 15 years, everyone has been talking about cell therapy and what you can do. These results suggest that really works,"" said study author Dr. Amit Patel, a cardiac surgeon and director of Medicine Cardiovascular regenerative Medicine Faculty of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, in a news release from the university. Another expert expressed cautious optimism about the results. Although the findings are promising ""still have to see more long-term data, and hopefully better standards of efficiency and cardiac performance,"" said Dr. David Friedman, chief of heart failure services Northwell Health Hospital Long Island Jewish Valley Stream. In heart failure, a weakened or damaged heart does not pump blood as it should. This potentially lethal disease affects about 5.7 million Americans, according to the American Heart Association (American Heart Association). In the new study 126 patients with heart failure participated. 60 received the stem cell treatment, while 66 received a placebo. After a year, 4 percent of patients with stem cell therapy had died, and about 52 percent had been hospitalized for heart failure. That was an improvement compared to the placebo group where 8 percent of the patients died and more than 82 percent ended up in the hospital, the team of Patel. ""This is the first trial showing that cell therapy can have a significant impact on the lives of patients with heart failure,"" said Patel. If further studies are successful, the stem cell therapy could one day offer an alternative to current treatments for end-stage heart failure, such as heart transplants and therapy of left ventricular assist devices, the researchers said. The study was published online April 4, The Lancet, and was presented simultaneously at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology (American College of Cardiology, ACC) in Chicago. The meeting of the ACC had other potentially good for patients with heart failure news. On Sunday, a 10-year study duration conducted by researchers at Duke University found that bypass surgery (bypass) along with medications it seems to work best for patients with heart failure who only uses drugs. The study involved more than 1,200 patients participated with severe heart disease and heart failure, who were followed for about a decade. All patients started taking standard medications for the heart, but also underwent a coronary bypass lived on average 16 months. They also suffered fewer heart attacks, strokes and hospitalizations, the study found.

Ferritin is a protein that stores the iron and transports it throughout your body. Iron and Ferritin are two different things and both need to be tested in order to test for iron deficiency. I have a high iron problem called hemochromatosis, also known as iron overload. Iron overload is when the ferritin keeps taking in the iron that you've consumed and instead of releasing it, it's storing it - often to dangerous levels. If left untreated, the iron will be deposited around your organs and it will cause things like heart failure and liver cancer. A person with iron overload can have their iron tested and appear anemic, BUT they can have outrageously high ferritin levels. Normal ferritin levels are: For men, 24 to 336 nanograms per milliliter (standard units) or 24 to 336 micrograms per liter (international units) For women, 11 to 307 nanograms per milliliter (standard units) or 11 to 307 micrograms per liter (international units) When I was diagnosed my ferritin level was 600, and I was only 21. Imagine if I hadn't gone to the doctor complaining of fatigue, what would my levels be at now, 6 years later? When other people are diagnosed their levels are often over 2000, a potentially very dangerous level if left untreated. Most women are diagnosed when they're in menopause and men are generally diagnosed when they're in their 40s. I'm not trying to freak people out, but iron overload is in one of every 200 to 300 people, especially people of UK or Eastern European descent. Despite it being so prevalent, doctors will rarely test for it unless you give them a reason to (I don't know why, because if it's untreated it will shorten your lifespan). I've seen so many posts about ""oh, I'm so tired, I must be anemic so I'm going to take an iron supplement"" and it drives me insane. Never take any kind of supplement without properly educating yourself on it. Iron overload literally has some of the same symptoms as anemia: chronic fatigue. joint pain. abdominal pain. liver disease (cirrhosis, liver cancer) diabetes mellitus. irregular heart rhythm. heart attack or heart failure. skin color changes (bronze, ashen-gray green) If found early, like it was in me, you'll be fine with no damage done so long as you periodically get blood drawn. But if you're middle aged or older, chances are the iron stored around your body has already harmed you and it needs to be taken care of immediately before anything worse comes from it.

The trial met its primary endpoint of demonstrating a reduction in the total number of deaths, cardiovascular hospitalizations or unplanned outpatient and emergency department visits to treat acute decompensated heart failure during the 12 months following treatment with ixmyelocel-T compared to placebo. All clinical events in the primary and secondary endpoints were adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an independent adjudication committee. The incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events, in patients treated with ixmyelocel-T was comparable to patients in the placebo group. Ixmyelocel-T has been granted orphan product designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment of DCM. ""The results of the ixCELL-DCM study, which we believe is the largest randomized cell therapy trial to treat congestive heart failure completed to date, demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in cardiac events in patients who received treatment with ixmyelocel-T compared to placebo,"" said Dr. David Recker, Vericel's chief medical officer. ""We are very excited about these study results given the lack of treatment options for end-stage heart failure patients."" The Phase 2b ixCELL-DCM clinical trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ixmyelocel-T compared to placebo when administered via transendocardial catheter-based injections to subjects with end-stage heart failure due to ischemic DCM, who have no reasonable revascularization options (either surgical or percutaneous interventional) likely to provide clinical benefit. The trial was designed to provide approximately 80% power to show a 46% difference in cardiac events for ischemic DCM patients treated with ixmyelocel-T compared to placebo. A total of 114 patients were treated in the ixCELL-DCM clinical trial at 28 sites in the United States. The full data results from the ixCELL-DCM trial are scheduled to be presented at the upcoming Late-Breaking Clinical Trial Sessions of the American College of Cardiology 65th Annual Scientific Session & Expo on April 4, 2016, and also will be submitted for publication.

BLOG,http://xconomy.com,http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2016/04/25/near-term-fda-nod-unlikely-for-duchenne-drug-after-negative-vote/,4/25/2016,20:25:22,4/26/2016 5:55,Near-Term FDA Nod Unlikely For Duchenne Drug After Negative Vote,"In a close 7-6 vote, a committee of medical experts said today that eteplirsen, a drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, has not met the bar set by the FDA for approval, which could make the drug the third Duchenne treatment in recent months to face FDA rejection, adding to the frustration of a tight-knit and increasingly desperate community of patients and their advocates. The committee, one of many that help the FDA evaluate drugs for approval, wrestled today with a question that, in most other circumstances, would never even merit consideration: Should the agency approve a drug based on one trial with just 12 patients? But the consideration was serious because Duchenne is a progressive, fatal disease with no effective treatments or cure. A throng of patient advocates and others more than 1,000 strong showed up, with more than 50 making their case at today?s hearing in Hyattsville, MD, a suburb of Washington, DC, that lasted more than 11 hours. Even the FDA?s top drug official made a rare appearance at the meeting, weighing in with comments just before the vote. Still, near-term approval of eteplirsen, developed by Cambridge, MA-based Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SRPT), appears unlikely. The recommendations of FDA advisory panels are not binding, but the agency typically sides with the experts? decisions. The 13-member panel voted 7 to 6 that Sarepta hasn?t provided ?substantial evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies? that eteplirsen helps Duchenne patients? bodies create enough dystrophin?the muscle-protecting protein they lack?to predict a benefit. Just before the vote, Janet Woodcock, the director of the FDA?s center for drug evaluation and research and a key decision maker on drug approvals, made clear that the matter at hand was ?accelerated approval,? a process that allows the agency to green light drugs on a thinner body of evidence. The FDA?s final decision, due by May 26, will have significant implications for both the drug industry and thousands of patients with Duchenne. Approval risks setting a precedent for allowing drugs onto the market with a bare minimum of human testing. A rejection means patients whose disease is a death sentence lose more time before a medicine is available. ?I respect the FDA?s caution in setting a precedent in approving new drugs. But our kids are not a precedent, they are real, live human beings, and they are short on time,? said Debra Miller, the CEO of the nonprofit Newport Beach, CA, organization CureDuchenne, at the hearing. ?An FDA official once told me, ?The worst thing we can do is approve a drug and then have to pull it off the market.? I argue that the worst thing we can do is deny access to a drug and then find out it works?too late, after we have lost a generation of children.? The implications of this panel were clear from the start. William Dunn, the director of the agency?s division of neurology products, noted that regardless of how urgently a drug is needed for Duchenne, the FDA would not lower its approval standards, nor would it take ?perverse delight? in rejecting a drug. He knew what was coming. ?Emotions will run high,? Dunn said. Children with Duchenne, their parents, doctors, and even some politicians spoke, nearly all pleading for the agency to approve the drug. One young patient, responding to the agency?s criticism of eteplirsen?s effectiveness, called the drug ?amazing? and ?life changing.? ?I can only guess you don?t know anything about Duchenne,? he said, as applause rang out. While the panel voted against eteplirsen, Woodcock?s comments seemed to leave the door open for more evaluation. ?In devastating diseases the consequences of this mistake can be extreme,? she said. ?But most of these cons are borne by the patients.? That said, the agency has already brushed patient and advocate pressure aside in rejecting two other Duchenne drugs that were close to approval. In January, the agency said no to drisapersen, a drug from BioMarin Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ: BMRN). A month later, it rejected an approval application from PTC Therapeutics (NASDAQ: PTCT) on a drug called ataluren. Both drisapersen and ataluren are meant to slow the grim march of Duchenne in certain subgroups of patients. The disease affects about 300,000 people worldwide, primarily boys, typically robs them of the ability to walk by their teens, and eventually kills them through one of a number of complications, like respiratory or heart failure. Despite the pressing need for a Duchenne therapy, data from the BioMarin and PTC drugs just weren?t good enough for regulators. The agency called BioMarin?s drisapersen data ?inconsistent and in some cases contradictory? and said PTC?s ataluren application was ?not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review.? Both drugs had failed Phase 3 clinical trials, but the companies claimed that post-hoc analyses showed the drugs were benefitting patients. Since the February rejection of PTC, all eyes have been on Sarepta, whose eteplirsen is also meant to slow the progression of Duchenne in a subset of patients?a group with a specific genetic mutation, about 13 percent of those with the disease. Sarepta?s original January date with the advisory committee was postponed by a snowstorm. But as with PTC and BioMarin, Sarepta faces ? Next Page ? Reprints | Share: UNDERWRITERS AND PARTNERS",0

A month ago, UT Health cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Mark Bonnell saved her life by implanting a battery-powered blood pump inside her chest to take over for her failing heart. Stacy Rollins talked with UT Health cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Mark Bonnell during a recent checkup. She is sharing her story during American Heart Month.February is American Heart Month, and Rollins is sharing her story to encourage other younger women to take care of themselves and pay attention to early warning signs of heart failure. ?I was in pretty good shape, but I had been under a lot of stress,? Rollins said. ?I started to feel terrible. I couldn?t breathe at night. I couldn?t go up the stairs. I was coughing. I thought it was pneumonia.? Turned out her heart was barely pumping. The cough wasn?t a cold. The fatigue and breathlessness were symptoms of heart failure, which can become rapidly fatal. In Rollins? case, she had familial idiopathic cardiomyopathy ? a weakening of the heart muscle that is inherited with unknown cause. Her only chance of survival was a Left Ventricular Assist Device, commonly known as an LVAD. It is a mechanical device that helps pump blood to the rest of the body. LVADs can serve as a bridge to a heart transplant or, in rare cases, as therapy for a patient as her heart heals. The longest a patient has lived with an LVAD is eight years and counting. ?Nationally, about 1 percent or less of these LVADs are taken out for recovery,? Bonnell said. ?Here at UTMC, we have actually taken out almost 10 percent of them.? UT Health cardiologist Dr. Samer Khouri said heart disease risk factors include a poor diet, lack of exercise and stress. ?This is what you call low-intensity stress that is continuous, unfortunately,? Khouri said. ?The cause can also be genetic.? Khouri said women, especially younger women, more often ignore or mistake symptoms of heart failure. ?This is an age where many have children,? Khouri said. ?They are so busy. They don?t have time for themselves.? With more women dying from heart disease than breast cancer and lung cancer combined, Rollins wants others to know she is alive and healthy today because she responded to the subtle symptoms of heart failure and asked for help. ?I am grateful for my doctors and my life,?

Congestive Heart Failure Signs and Symptoms. Congestive Heart Failure Treatment. A heart attack happens when your heart cannot get enough oxygen because the blood flow is abruptly disrupted. The heart muscle cannot pump properly, and tissue rapidly begins to die.[1] About 735,000 Americans have a heart attack every year.[2] However, only about 27% of people know all the urgent symptoms of a heart attack.[3] Don?t let yourself be a statistic. Crushing chest pain and upper body soreness (with or without exertion) are the typical heart attack symptoms, but there are other warning signs you should also heed. Recognizing the signs of a heart attack and getting to the hospital immediately can mean the difference between survival, irreversible tissue damage, and death. If you have any doubt about whether the pain you?re experiencing is a heart attack, seek medical help immediately. Five Parts: 1- Recognizing When to Get Emergency Medical Attention https://youtu.be/NvPOlN4RGH4 2- Recognizing Other Early Warning Signs 3- Taking Action While Waiting for Emergency Assistance 4- Understanding Other Causes of Symptoms 5- Knowing Your Risk Tips: Do not allow embarrassment or worry that you aren?t ?really? having a heart attack to keep you from seeking medical help. Delaying seeking medical assistance could kill you. Do not take any heart attack symptoms lightly. If you do not feel better after a few (5-10) minutes of sitting and resting, seek immediate medical assistance. Warnings: You are at higher risk for a second heart attack if you have had one before. Do not use a defibrillator (AED) unless you are specifically trained. In silent ischemia, a heart attack may occur with no prior symptoms or warning signs.

In these two instances a person breathing becomes very hard or basically someones heartbeat stops. Cpr training Sacramento is mostly recommendable for those people living family members who have heart problems. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation basically is an emergency technique or procedure that usually provides enough oxygen and proper blood circulation for people going through cardiac arrest. There are a variety of CPR procedures specifically meant for adults and children. This article will look at cardiopulmonary resuscitation for adults simply because they are more prone to heart attacks. There are several processes or procedures of CPR carried out for children and adults and such procedures are quite different from each other. This article will mainly look at resuscitation that is done on adults. The reason being adults are actually more exposed to dangers of cardiac arrest than children. When a person is really finding it hard to breath normally they should know they might be having cardiac symptoms and need to be checked in advanced. This article will major of resuscitation for grown adults. The reason being, cardiac arrest has been seen so much on adult as compared to children. Breathing difficulties should never be treated or taken lightly as they may be the earlier signs of cardiac arrest. A person heart muscle may suddenly stop and if those people near them have no training, one can die. This heart failure may prove to be fatal in case they are not helped immediately. Some of the basic symptoms of such arrests are, finding it hard to inhale, unconsciousness, gasping of air, not breathing at all and having no pulse. Some heart attacks consequently end up causing cardiac arrest. There are quite a number of people in city Sacramento, CA who cannot clearly draw clear distinction between cardiac arrest and this heart attack. When someone has shown the above mentioned symptoms, they should immediately take their phones and dial 911 seeking for an ambulance. CPR can come in handy in preventing someone life from being lost while waiting for hospital ambulance to arrive. This is how Cardiopulmonary resuscitate an individual who is basically experiencing breathing difficulties and when their pulse is absent. The technique will comprise of rescue breathing and also chest compressions. CPR that is done on adults can be approached in distinct ways, there is the full version and actually focuses or concentrates on circulation, breathing and airway and the other approach is hands only version that is most recommended for individuals who do not have prior training. If a person has never received any form of cardiopulmonary resuscitation training they should only perform hand only that is according to recommendation from American Heart Association. This will basically boost blood circulation consequently preventing death. First thing to do is dialing 911. After making the call, push put some pressure on the victims chest using your hand heels. The second approach is referred to as hands only version. Hands only is a method recommended to be conducted by persons without prior training on such matters. The recommendation was done by American Heart Association.

Many medical experts and nutritionists highly recommend that we should eat fruits and other healthy foods for breakfast, but, did you know what will happen to your body if you eat oatmeal every day? This super healthy food is packed with healthy nutrients and it can provide many health benefits. People have learned to grow and harvest oats as a source of food and medicine for over two thousand years. As we said, this super healthy food is loaded with healthy nutrients and it can be used for many different ailments, such as: intestinal problems, nerve problems, etc. HERE?S WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR BODY WHEN YOU EAT OATMEAL EVERY DAY Note: before we start, you should know that there are some health conditions, for example gout, that won?t benefit from this oatmeal diet. Well, this means that if you have some health problems, then you should consult your doctor before you make some diet changes. NUTRITIONAL BENEFITS OF EATING OATMEAL EVERY DAY Let me say a few words about this super healthy food ? you should know that oatmeal is a whole grain that contains 13 grams of protein in one small half-cup serving. Did you know that ? serving of oatmeal gives you almost 100% of your recommended daily intake of manganese! Oatmeal is loaded with antioxidants including Vitamin E, tocotrieonols, selenium, phenolic acids, and phytic acid. Oatmeal contains other healthy nutrients as well, such as: Vitamin B1, Biotin, Molybdenum, Phosphorus, Copper and Magnesium among many other phytonutrients. CHANGES YOU CAN SEE IN YOUR BODY WHEN YOU EAT OATMEAL EVERY DAY The first and the best reason why you should consume oatmeal every day is that it can help prevent obesity and weight gain. The medical experts think that this is probably because the oatmeal will ?give? you the feeling of satiety, which means that you will feel fuller for a long time. And this actually means that you won?t eat too much and you will lose weight much faster. You should also know that oatmeal creates positive changes in your body in a several ways and makes you feel full longer. You will notice that this super healthy food provides excellent low-level energy for a longer period of time. And other good thing is that oatmeal provides fiber to keep your stomach feeling full longer. You should eat a bowl of oatmeal every morning, because it provides a good source of energy throughout the morning hours, without a dramatic increase or drop in blood sugar. You should know that this is because of the low-glycemic impact (GI) on oatmeal and it won?t cause any dramatic increase or drop in the blood sugar levels. And this is amazing, because if you?re able to maintain lower blood sugar levels over a longer period of time, it will help your body to regulate insulin usage. As we mentioned before, the low GI of oatmeal helps you avoid cravings due to a drop in blood sugar. Without the low blood sugar cravings, we are less likely to reach for our favorite comfort food. You should also know that the daily caloric impact of an oatmeal breakfast is huge and this super healthy food may help you decrease your total daily calories by as much as 81%. The medical experts say that oatmeal prevented people from over-consuming calories at later meals in a study of high-GI breakfasts versus low-GI breakfast foods and the later caloric intake in the day. We all know that the other low-calorie, low fat diet foods are not good at making us feel satisfied. And this super healthy food is an excellent choice, because it provides that happy, satisfied, not-hungry-at-all feeling, which also means that you will eat less throughout the rest of the day. This daily decrease in your need for calories will result in wonderful weight loss and fat loss changes in your body. OTHER HEALTH BENEFITS OF EATING OATMEAL EVERY DAY It will reduce your LDL cholesterol levels Increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases Oatmeal will reduce the risk of heart failure significantly It will boost your immune system Oatmeal will help you regulate your blood sugar levels and reduce risk of developing diabetes type 2 Oatmeal is an excellent source of fiber, which protects against breast cancer Did you know that whole grain foods will protect against childhood asthma? Safe grain alternative for celiac disease sufferers or those who are avoiding gluten in their diets It will extend the life expectancy WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT OAT PROCESSING Oat groats:are the un-flattened kernels, which are very good and beneficial for using as a breakfast cereal or for stuffing Steel-cut oats:steel cut oats are produced by running the grain through steel blades that thinly slices them featuring a dense and chewy texture Old-fashioned oats:these oats have a flatter shape that is the result of their being steamed and then rolled Quick-cooking oats:these oats are usually processed like old-fashioned oats, except they are cut finely before rolling Instant oatmeal:the instant oatmeal product is produced by partially cooking the grains and then rolling them very thin Oat bran:oat bran is just the outer layer of the oat grain that resides under the hull Note: you should know that you can use any of these oats and they are all healthy. But, as we all know (when it comes to food) ? the less processing usually means a higher nutritional benefit. You can also add oats to your favorite protein shake, smoothie or to your favorite yogurt. Look for creative ways to add this food that will make you feel full longer.

There are several sorts of diabetic issues recognized to the medical neighborhood, and all are triggered by an assortment of different factors ? in truth, present investigation in the medical local community tends to find out new possible triggers of diabetic issues each and every yr. Ultimately, diabetic issues is introduced on by an personal?s pancreas getting to be unable to produce the needed sum of insulin to stop the growth of hyperglycemia. Once an individual has produced type 1 or type 2 diabetes, it is incurable ? but it is treatable. If the diabetic issues is not controlled through health care treatment, it can guide to lifestyle-threatening difficulties, such as a greater risk of heart failure, blindness, significant nerve harm, and foot wounds that could direct to amputation. Type one diabetes differs from variety 2 in that it is much more frequently discovered in gentlemen, and it may possibly have a modest genetic link. This kind of diabetes tends to create when the cells inside of a single?s pancreas are attacked by the immune technique, disallowing the pancreas to make the necessary amount of insulin and therefore creating an insulin deficiency. It is also attainable to build sort one diabetes through right after-problems of viral bacterial infections contracted for the duration of a single?s childhood or youth. These may possibly get a toll on the immune program, causing it to malfunction afterwards in one?s life. Type 2 diabetes has a much larger genetic link, typically resulting from a predisposition toward the ailment and life-style options that trigger the illness to create. Dad and mom could move this illness on to their youngsters at start, even though it is feasible to decrease the danger of at any time developing sort 2 diabetic issues: this requires smart alternatives when it will come to way of life practices and diet plan, such as lowering or removing the consumption of large-excess fat foods and too much alcoholic beverages, retaining energetic, and becoming careful to avoid getting to be over weight. It is possible miracle shake for ed kind two diabetes to turn into onset with age, no matter of prior life style alternatives, basically owing to genetics. Danger for genetically onset diabetic issues tends to improve at close to forty five many years previous, and right after 65 the threat turns into even greater. In addition, there are specified ethnic groups whose genetic predisposition toward creating kind two diabetes is considerably increased. These teams incorporate African Us citizens, Hispanic People in america, Indigenous Us citizens, and Japanese Individuals. Individuals belonging to these ethnic groups would do effectively to take added care when it will come to diet regime and life-style, in get to make certain a long and content lifestyle.",0

Pediatric cardiology researchers and clinicians from multiple centers worldwide are gathering at the Cardiology 2016: the 19th Annual Update on Pediatric and Congenital Cardiovascular Disease conference, sponsored by The Children?s Hospital of Philadelphia on Feb. 24 to Feb. 28 in Orlando, Fla. Among the many investigators presenting research at the event, the conference organizers chose eight clinical researchers as finalists for the Outstanding Investigator Award. The following news briefs summarize their presentations of research in congenital heart disease (CHD). All presentations occurred at the Loew?s Royal Pacific Resort at Universal Orlando. Using the CVP Score to Evaluate Fetal Hemodynamics This study investigated the cardiovascular profile score (CVP), an echo-based multivariable tool that assesses fetal hemodynamics, in a multicenter cohort of fetuses with Ebstein?s anomaly/tricuspid valve dysplasia (EA/TVD). Using a scale of 0 to 10, a CVP may help predict outcomes in fetuses with growth restriction and congenital heart defects. A previous pilot study showed that a CVP score under 7 was associated with poorer survival. The researchers performed a 23-center retrospective review of fetal echo data and outcomes in a cohort of 243 fetuses diagnosed with EA/TVD from 2005 to 2011. Evaluating the first and last fetal echo in gestation, the team found that fetuses with CVP scores below 7 on the first or last fetal echo were less likely to survive, suggesting that this score may be a valuable tool to help guide fetal counseling.

Although adults undergoing cardiac catheterization are known to have better outcomes in institutions that perform higher numbers of this procedure, less is known about outcomes in CHD patients. This study investigated the risk of a major adverse event (MAE) in patients with CHD. Drawing on the IMPACT (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatment) Registry, the researchers analyzed more than 56,000 cardiac catheterizations at 77 hospitals between 2011 and 2015. After multivariable adjustment, compared to low-volume programs, the odds of an adverse event were 0.55 at medium-volume programs (those with 150-299 annual procedures), 0.62 at high-volume programs (300-499 annual procedures), and 0.52 at very high-volume programs (over 500 annual procedures). Although the risk of MAE after cardiac catheterization in patients with CHD is low at all hospitals, it is significantly higher among lower-volume hospitals?those with fewer than 150 annual cases.

The research team queried the Pediatric Health Information System database for all patients under age 19 admitted from 2004 to 2013 with acute decompensated heart failure and a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. In the 2,968 patients meeting the study criteria, 19 percent had a diagnosis of anemia, and mortality was 10.2 percent. Patients with anemia had higher prevalence of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, ventricular assist device placement, vasopressor or inotrope use, and longer length of stay. All these associations remained when controlling for packed red blood cell transfusion (PRBCT). After controlling for PRBCT, anemia was associated with mortality. Anemia is prevalent in this pediatric population and is associated with adverse outcomes.

Researchers at Lucile Packard Children?s Hospital Stanford and Cincinnati Children?s Hospital Medical Center studied whether providing 30-minute sessions of massage therapy to children would reduce their need for opioids and benzodiazepines to address postsurgical pain and anxiety. The study team randomized 60 patients aged 6 to 19 into two groups?one receiving standard of care plus two to three sessions of massage therapy per week, other receiving standard care plus three 30-minute reading sessions during their hospitalization. The children who received massage therapy used less benzodiazepines in the first five post-operative days than those receiving reading. There was no difference in opioid exposure between the groups. This suggests that non-traditional forms of pain control may be useful in children undergoing heart surgery, Staveski SL, Cincinnati Children?s Hospital Medical Center; The Impact of Massage and Reading on Children?s Pain and Anxiety after Cardiovascular Surgery: A Pilot Study [abstract 60 Feb. 26, 2016] 20-Year Survival Rates in Single Ventricle Patients with Intact Fontan Circulation This single-center study analyzed 20 years of experience and long-term outcomes in children who underwent the Fontan operation for single-ventricle disease at The Children?s Hospital of Philadelphia between 1992 and 2009. The researchers investigated 773 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 49 percent of whom had hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Median follow-up was 8.9 years, with one-third of the cohort having follow-up greater than 15 years. The study team measured a composite outcome of death, transplant or Fontan takedown. Risk factors for early death or loss of Fontan were having a pre-1996 Fontan, post-operative pleural drainage greater than 14 days, prolonged ICU stay and longer aortic cross-clamp time. Risk factors for the late composite outcome were mild or greater AV valve regurgitation before Fontan and prolonged ICU stay. The overall survival with intact Fontan circulation was 74 percent. For patients surviving to one year, the conditional survival estimate was 79 percent at 20 years.

Although a variety of VADs are available for adult patients, the only pediatric VAD device has troubling rates of thromboembolism, pump thrombosis and bleeding. The researchers developed a pulsatile infant VAD with the goal of minimizing thrombus formation and tested it in lambs, using low levels of the anticoagulant unfractionated heparin as a challenge test of thrombogenicity. All the animals completed the 60-day study duration with no clinical signs of thromboembolism. VAD flow was 1.2 plus or minus 0.2 liters/min, and blood chemistry values returned to normal within 2 weeks.

The researchers used prospectively collected data from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) for pediatric patients from 2005 to 2014, examining a cohort of 1,426 cases with a median age of 16. The overall survival of 16 percent was poor, but comparable to the rate in adults. The rate of public AED use remains low at 26 percent. Survivors were more likely to have their arrest witnessed, to be in a public location and to have a shockable rhythm. In addition, age was found to be the most powerful predictor of public AED use.

Researchers performed a population-based analysis of maternal outcomes in women with congenital heart disease (CHD). Drawing on the Texas Inpatient Public Use Data File, the researchers studied discharges of pregnant women between 1999 and 2012. Of more than 5.3 million pregnancy-related discharges, 2,747 women had CHD. Compared to women without CHD, those with CHD had higher adverse maternal outcomes, including acute renal failure, cardiac arrest, ICU admissions, longer length of stay, and death. The heart lesions most associated with higher risk of adverse outcomes were ventricular septal defect/Eisenmenger and aortic valve disease. Pulmonary stenosis, tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries and Ebstein anomaly were associated with minimal adverse events during the peripartum period.

Click to show Spoiler - click again to hide... ? Los Angeles (AFP) - Nancy Reagan, devoted wife and trusted confidante to late president Ronald Reagan who became the most ardent guardian of his legacy, died on Sunday, aged 94. The former first lady, who suffered heart failure at her home in Los Angeles, will be buried next to her husband at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, her spokeswoman Joanne Drake said. Late in life, Reagan earned praise for many of the very qualities that saw her savaged by critics during Ronald Reagan's two White House terms from 1981-1989 -- her fierce protectiveness and outsized influence on the president. Perceived as regal and cold, she was feared by White House aides who often found themselves butting heads with her over policy and personnel appointments. She made her own mark as first lady with her signature ""Just Say No"" drug awareness campaign, launched in 1982. But after she left the White House, as she nursed Reagan through his ten-year descent into Alzheimer's disease until his death in 2004, America softened its view of the former movie starlet. Proud example Warm tributes noting Nancy Reagan's steadfast dedication to her husband poured in, with President Barack Obama and wife Michelle calling her a ""proud example."" ""We remain grateful for Nancy Reagan's life, thankful for her guidance, and prayerful that she and her beloved husband are together again,"" the Obamas said in a statement. Former first lady Barbara Bush said she was ""totally devoted to President Reagan, and we take comfort that they will be reunited once more."" Former California governor and action movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger described her as ""one of my heroes"" who ""served as first lady with unbelievable power, class and grace."" ""Nancy Reagan, the wife of a truly great president, was an amazing woman. She will be missed!"" said Donald Trump, the frontrunner in the race to be the Republicans' presidential candidate in November. President Reagan is viewed as something of a patron saint of conservatives and the patriarch of the modern Republican Party, and the diminutive former first lady has wielded considerable political power as a succession of presidential hopefuls have sought her endorsement. Born Anne Frances Robbins in New York on July 6, 1921 -? and given the name Nancy by her mother, Edith Robbins -? Reagan's car salesman father left the family when she was young. Edith toured the country as an actress, marrying prominent neurosurgeon Loyal Davis, and settling the family in Chicago. Inspired by her mother, Nancy worked as an actress on stage and in film and television, and met Ronald Reagan while under contract with MGM. Love story They married in 1952 after Reagan divorced his first wife, actress Jane Wyman, beginning a marriage that has been described as a love story to rival any that the couple acted out on the silver screen. The pair, who wrote passionate love letters to each other over the decades, had two children: Patti, born in 1952 and Ron, born in 1958. She made 11 films in all, including three after her marriage, appearing alongside her husband just once, in her last role in ""Hellcats of the Navy"" (1956). When Reagan went into California politics in the 1960s, Nancy recast herself as the ultimate political wife and confidante, serving as his first lady there from 1967-1975. Only months after he took office as US president in 1981, Reagan narrowly survived an assassination attempt that spurred Nancy to take a keener role as her husband's protector, strictly controlling access to the president. She sometimes set out to influence decision-making indirectly by taking her case to people her husband trusted. Other times, her role took on a bizarre twist as she consulted astrologers to guide administration policy. Dragon ""When she gets her hackles up, she can be a dragon,"" said former Reagan chief of staff Howard Baker, appointed after Nancy Reagan engineered the firing of his predecessor, Don Regan. In a 1988 interview, Nancy said she was forced to exert her influence because her husband was poorly served by his aides, especially during the Iran-contra scandal that tarnished his reputation. To the public, Nancy Reagan became best known for her glamorous designer clothes, Hollywood friends and reported social climbing, as well as her ""Just Say No"" anti-drug campaign. Behind closed doors, her actions were much more important. ""Nancy wasn't popular and she operated under cover, usually through a surrogate,"" columnist Eleanor Clift wrote years ago in The Washington Post. Clift said Nancy's ""instinct for moderation drew her into debates over everything from social policy to US-Soviet relations"" as she tried to protect her husband from right-wing influence. After the Reagans left the White House in 1989, ""tell-all"" books by Regan and especially an unauthorized biography by Kitty Kelley, cast Nancy Reagan in an unflattering light, even alleging an affair with Frank Sinatra. But in 1994 she played a key role in her husband's widely-praised disclosure that he had Alzheimer's and became a vocal campaigner for awareness of the disease. As his memory faded and he no longer recognized the woman he had loved for half a century, Nancy Reagan again closed ranks around him, shielding him from public view and even from old friends to protect his image and dignity. ""Ronnie's long journey has finally taken him to a distant place where I can no longer reach him,"" a rueful Nancy Reagan said at an Alzheimer's fundraiser years ago. DRILLZ ?

Pain is not a disease on its own, but it is a signal that your body has a medical condition that needs treatment. It is common for one to make an off-counter purchase of drugs that relieve pain, but it is advisable to visit a doctor for an examination. Instead of overlooking pains, you can consult a pain doctor Houston professional for advice, assessment, and treatment. There are several pains that you should not ignore as this article discusses. One of the pains that you should not overlook is severe morning headache. A mild headache can go unnoticed, but a severe headache denotes an acute health issue such as a brain tumor. The condition is rare. Therefore, you should not think of a brain tumor every time your head hurts in the morning. The incidence of a primary brain tumor is usually below one percent. Severe stomach pains point to several health issues including ulcers. Discomfort that occurs between the navel and the breastbone is a sign to watch out for since it is usually suggestive. This form of irritation is also known as a burning pain, and it should be checked as soon as possible. Other common signs that accompany such irritation include discomfort in the stool and a better feeling when you take a meal. Blood clots and congestive heart failure have a common sign where one experiences discomfort on legs. The earlier sign is a swelling and painful discomfort on one leg whereas the other sign is swelling in both legs. Blood clots come after one has a recent surgery or rests for a long time. Traveling on a plane or a car sometimes also results in having a blood clot. Sometimes you can have a severe back irritation that wakes you up from a deep sleep at night. Not only is such an irritation disruptive to a restful night, but it can also be a sign of fever or cancer especially if you have a family history of such conditions. It is tempting just to assume that the discomfort is out of the wear and tear of the body, but it can be an indicator of more complex health conditions. Having a painful discomfort that feels as if it is penetrating the back is a sign that you should never ignore. Sometimes it is a sign that your arteries can be hardening gradually, and that is why you experience the irritation. One of the early indicators of diabetes is having a feeling of pins and needles in the feet. A lot of people live with diabetes since they tend to ignore the feeling. What follows after the feeling is numbness of the feet. Making a prompt visit to a specialist after having the pins and needles in the feet enables one to manage diabetes at its early stages. Having the discussed signs does not necessarily mean that you have the medical conditions that are associated with them. However, it is only a doctor who can confirm the nature of the resultant medical conditions that the pains indicate. Therefore, you should make a visit to a specialist to have the pains examined.

The affected individual has to wake up every so often to breathe. Persons with this problem tend to snore and are excessively tired and drowsy during the day due to lack of good quality of sleep. There are a number of facts on obstructive sleep apnea Richardson TX residents need to understand if they are struggling with this problem. The underlying problem in this condition is excessive relaxation of throat muscles. These muscles comprise those of the soft palate, the tonsils and the uvula. The relaxed muscles narrow the space that is used by inhaled air. Total obstruction occurs intermittently for a period of ten to twenty seconds causing arousal from sleep. Snoring is the resulting of vibrating loose muscles as air is forced through. A number of factors have been shown to predispose to this condition. Excessive weight is one of them. This risk factor is present in about 50% of those affected. It is believed to contribute to the problem due to increased fat deposition around the upper airway that subsequently leads to obstruction. Related to the same, is the possession of large neck (defined as a circumference of more than 16 inches in women and 17 inches in men). Others are chronic nasal congestion, smoking, hypertension and diabetes. If not treated, this condition may lead to a number of complications. Cardiovascular problems result from reduced oxygenation of blood that in turn causes a strain on the heart. The risk of hypertension, heart failure and abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) are increased. Another major complication is reduced productivity due to daytime fatigue. Children with the condition may have poorer academic performance compared to their peers. The first step in dealing with this problem is to institute lifestyle changes. One of them is to lose excess weight if you have been classified as being overweight or obese. Other measures that can be undertaken easily include taking part in regular physical exercise, reducing smoking and alcohol intake. In case of nasal congestion, steroid based nasal decongestants offer some benefits. Other treatment options are considered in case the lifestyle changes prove ineffective. There are a number of devices that can be used to open up blocked airways and reduce the severity of obstruction. You will need to see a dental specialist to get the device that is most appropriate in your case. Surgery may be used as a last resort. The type of operation that is performed is dependent on the cause. One of the commonly performed procedures is removal of loose tissues around the upper airway. A procedure known as Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, UPP, involves the removal of tonsils, the uvula and a part of the soft palate. This is considered a major operation that is done under general anesthesia. Jaw surgery is another alternative that helps increase the space behind the tongue. The most important thing about sleep apnea is to seek treatment early. While the rate of complications is fairly low, there is a profound effect on the quality of life of the affected persons and their loved ones. Fortunately, lifestyle modifications are effective in many of the persons suffering from the condition.

However Dialysis could only clean the small-sized toxic substances, the medium- and large-sized toxic substance remains in the kidney. So the patient undertaking dialysis treatment should also take other treatments to protect the kidney function. What is more serious, long term dialysis will also trigger so many side effects and complications.

BROWN Los Angeles, United States ? Former US first lady Nancy Reagan was lying in repose at her husband?s presidential library on Wednesday, with members of the public paying their last respects ahead of a private funeral. Reagan, who died Sunday at age 94 due to heart failure, will be buried next to her husband, conservative icon Ronald Reagan, on the grounds of the library in the city of Simi Valley near Los Angeles. A hearse carrying Nancy Reagan?s coffin traveled as part of a motorcade on Wednesday along several highways, with firefighters standing at attention on overpasses, before arriving at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Library. Eight Secret Service agents carried her coffin inside, library spokeswoman Melissa Giller said. Public visitation is Wednesday and Thursday, with the private funeral at 11 am (1900 GMT) Friday. One thousand people, including First Lady Michelle Obama, former first lady and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and former president George W. Bush and his wife Laura are expected to attend. Other expected attendees include actress Anjelica Huston, singer Wayne Newton, 1980s TV star Mr. T and journalists Katie Couric, Sam Donaldson and Chris Matthews. A fierce protector of her husband and his political legacy, Reagan had outsize influence during her White House years from 1981 to 1989. Ronald Reagan, the 40th US president, suffered from Alzheimer?s disease after leaving office and went into a long decline, cared for by his wife until his death in 2004.

Widely tipped to become a multi-billion dollar brand, Entresto (valsartan and sacubitril) brought in just $17m in sales in the first quarter, with greater prescribing momentum in EU markets thanks largely to prescribing hurdles introduced by health insurers in the US. ""We cautioned that uptake, particularly in the US, would be very slow at the beginning because access would be blocked,"" said Novartis' pharma chief David Epstein on the firm's first-quarter results call. However, ""we remain confident that the sales of this product would be in the range of $5bn in reduced ejection heart failure"", its first approved indication, he added. Despite stellar efficacy data from the PARADIGM trial, managed care plans in the US have put hurdles in place - including a requirement for prior authorisation - that have made physicians reluctant to write Entresto prescriptions, particularly for patients who are stable on current therapies. Based on its initial experiences in the US, Novartis has also focused its marketing efforts in Europe on heart failure patients with symptoms - i.e. those who are not stable - and has found that doctors are more likely to prescribe in these cases. Novartis is predicting sales will start to accelerate in the second half of this year and drive the product to around $200m in sales for 2016 as a whole. Additional momentum could come from new indications - including preserved ejection heart failure (assuming the ongoing PARAGON trial is positive) and post-acute myocardial infarction. While Entresto is growing slowly, Novartis' other main product launch - Cosentyx (secukinumab) for psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis - is off to a good start with quarterly sales of $176m, up from $22m in the same period of 2015. Epstein pointed to particularly strong take-up in Germany. Having already overtaken Johnson & Johnson's rival psoriasis drug Stelara (ustekinumab), Cosentyx is on course to topple AbbVie's Humira (adalimumab) as the number one biologic brand in the German market, he added. Interestingly, he noted that with increased resistance to the use of high-priced new biologic drugs in the US - which often takes the form of 'step-edits' in which patients must exhaust other treatment options beforehand - the situation in Europe is freer. ""In Europe, those step-edits do not exist, which means a patient can move immediately from oral therapy to Cosentyx at the first biologic therapy,"" he said. Cosentyx was however a high point in a quarter undermined by generic competition to Novartis' cancer drug Glivec/Gleevec (imatinib) - with sales down 22% to $835m - and underperformance by eye health unit Alcon. Net sales fell 3% to $11.6bn in the quarter and Novartis reported a 12% reduction in operating income to $2.5bn. Article by",0

I couldn?t go to the newspaper vender as smoke and fire force scared me. I missed my usual finance newspapers that morning. Any calamity is an opportunity. That gave me a chance to read ?The Rhetoric Of Inequality? by former Procter & Gamble CEO Gurucharan Das published in The Times of India that day. The article gives a fair idea about how those who have never been hungry, or have forgotten the ?hungry days? looks at hunger. Das claims that ?carping over inequality? tantamount to ?debating what was settled long ago- you don?t make the poor rich by making the rich poor?. Excerpts from the article: ?I have always believed that it is none of my business how much the Ambanis earn as long as they create lots of jobs, pay their taxes and produce wealth for the society. The aam aadmi cares mostly about how he is fairing; he sometimes compares himself to his friends but never to the filthy rich. Judging the lifestyle of others tempts one to control other things, and this is a short step to becoming a command society. Not to live ostentatiously is a call of Dharma, not a legal duty.? I am totally ?brain-washed? by Gurucharan Das and I leave it to you think for yourself, for now. If I am able to come out of the ?damage?, I will be back with my views later! II FROM HERE AND THERE February 22, 2016 Needed, higher insurance cover This refers to Aarati Krishnan?s article ?Deposit insurance: what you didn?t know? (Real returns, February 22). The article brings together in one place several FAQs on deposit insurance with answers explaining factual position. The article will serve a larger purpose, if policy makers take cognizance of the constraints within which DICGC is functioning today and initiate moves that will help the organisation recast its vision and mission to conform to the present scenario in which banks and financial institutions are working in India today. Such a makeover for DICGC may have to factor in: (i) The resources at DICGC?s command at Rs50,000 crore is not small. But, it is inadequate to meet the business expansion the corporation may have to think of, if the confidence deposit insurance should instil among depositors is to be restored. DICGC may also have to revisit credit guarantee, a function it exited some time back, in the changed environment. (ii) Since 2014, there has been some effort to professionalise DICGC. This need to be taken forward. (iii) The anomalous situation arising from commercial banks meeting the cost of the inefficiency of cooperative banks will have to be rectified. (iv) The corporation should apply its mind as to whether continuing the level of deposit insurance should be retained at a low of Rs one lakh. Perhaps the threshold should be raised to a level to provide cover for at least 50 per cent of bank deposits. (v) Corporation could consider expanding its ambit to all financial institutions regulated by RBI which are accepting deposits from public. This may need differential rates of premia and coordination with regulatory and supervisory arms of RBI. M G Warrier,Mumbai February 17, 2016 Stop speculating on RBI Apropos ?RBI Guv and Never Ending Speculation? (Economic Times, Money & banking, February 17), one wonders why ET should join the speculators. It is common knowledge that even in 2013 when Dr Raghuram Rajan was being tipped for the Governor?s position, there were other influential contenders and an opposing school of economists who were spreading all sorts of rumours against Dr Rajan. They were again active during the first half of 2014, gossiping about the possibility of a change of guard at Mint Road, post General Election. It is India?s good fortune that Dr Rajan survived the moves against him, so far. World has acknowledged that the leadership provided by Dr Rajan in the conduct of RBI?s affairs has been excellent. If India decides and Dr Rajan accepts on a longer term re-appointment, this paper should not have a doubt about Dr Rajan?s capability to sort out his personal relationship with the University with which he has had an enduring relationship for the last two decades. As any new incumbent governor in RBI takes minimum six months to ?settle down? and the ?work-in-progress? there now needs continuity in leadership, GOI may not think in terms of replacing Dr Rajan in September 2016 and perhaps offer a re-appointment for a longer tenure. But, reports like this can help gossip-mongers and have some impact on the thought processes of economists and media which can influence economy adversely. M G WARRIER, Mumbai Business Standard February 26, 2016 Banks? health worries This refers to Sudhir Keshav Bhave?s letter ?A sinking ship? (February 26). This could be an example of how transparency in a sensitive business like banking can spread panic. The Indian banking sector is not in as bad a shape as is being made out by some analysts and external agencies. Major Indian commercial banks including SBI have been able to meet all statutory requirements. Unlike their corporate co-travellers, banks are meeting their payment obligations on due dates and in the recent past there have been no bank failures in the commercial banking sector in India. Part of credit for this should go to the vigilant regulator. This is not to argue that all is well as regards functioning of commercial banks. There is immediate need to restore the health of the banking system impaired mainly by reluctance of big borrowers to make timely repayment and heavy burden on public sector banks (PSBs) arising from workload and drain on resources in performance of social responsibilities. There is no point in arguing now that the overhaul and professionalization of public sector banks (PSBs) should have happened along with bank nationalisation and there should have been regular ?health checks? and ongoing corrections. Just as a ?health check-up? does not change the condition of a person, the re-classification of more loans as NPAs does not alter a bank?s ability to change. The need of the hour is to support banks to recover their dues from borrowers who have the capacity to repay, infuse professionalism in the banks? working and restore the faith in the banking system. As private sector banks have failed to perform their responsibilities and are not too willing to grow (their share in banking business is less than 30 per cent), privatising the existing public sector banks is no solution. Perhaps, GOI should consider nationalising entire banking business and restructuring the banking system to serve public interest. M G Warrier, Mumbai III SELF DEVELOPMENT A suggestion shared by a doctor, worth accepting* Each individual must take note of the three ? minutes. Why is it important? Three ? minutes will greatly reduce the number of sudden deaths. Often this occurs when a person who still look healthy, has died in the night. We hear stories of people suddenly die? The reason is that when you wake up at night to go to the bathroom, it is often done in a rush. Immediately when stand up, the brain lacks blood flow. Why ""three ? minutes"" is very important? In the middle of the night when you are awakened by the urge to urinate for example, ECG pattern can change. Because getting up suddenly, the brain which is anaemic can lead to heart failure due to lack of blood. Hence, always practice "" three ? minutes"", which are: 1. When waking from sleep, lie in bed for the first ? minute; 2. Sit in bed for the next ? minute; 3. Lower your legs, sitting on the edge of the bed for the last ? minute. After three ? minutes, you will not have an anaemic brain and heart will not fail, reducing the possibility of a fall or sudden death. Share with family, friends loved ones. It can occur regardless of age; young or old. Sharing is Caring. If you already know, regard this as refresher! *Copied from an email received from Vathsala Jayaraman (Exrbites Group) __._,_.___",0

Despite the progress, however, it's still the No. 1 killer in the United States. But researchers are making advances in the battle against heart disease. They?re developing new medications, techniques and devices that lower blood pressure and ?bad? cholesterol, detecting heart failure without a doctor visit to replacing damaged heart valves without surgery. Some researchers have taken a more low-tech approach that can save the lives of pregnant women and new mothers: teaching health-care providers to take these women?s cardiac symptoms more seriously. In 2015 alone, advances ranged from the approval of a more effective heart-failure medication to ?printing? a soft model of heart tissue that could one day form the base for repairing damaged heart muscle. ?It?s been a good year, with a lot to talk about,? says Steven Nissen, M.D., chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.

It caused the unique advantage over other ACE inhibitors in a lower incidence of dry cough. After oral administration, the administration imidapril is rapidly converted in the liver to its active metabolite imidapril. Plasma levels of imidapril gradual increase in proportion to the dose and slowly decrease. Time to maximum plasma concentration (T (max)) is 2.0 hours to 9.3 hours and imidapril to reach for imidaprilat. The half-life of elimination (t (1/2)) of imidapril and imidaprilat is 1.7 and 14.8 h, respectively. Imidapril and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine. When ACE inhibitors, imidaprilat is as effective as enalapril, an active metabolite of enalapril, and about twice as high as captopril. In hypertensive patients, blood pressure was reduced to 24 hours after administration of imidapril. The antihypertensive effect of imidapril was dose-dependent. The maximum decrease in blood pressure and plasma ACE has been performed with imidapril, 10 mg once daily, and the additive effect was not evident with the higher doses. In patients with an acute myocardial infarction, imidapril improved ventricular ejection fraction and reduces brain natriuretic peptide plasma (BNP). In patients with mild to moderate CHF [New York Heart Association (NYHA) II-III], imidapril increased exercise time and physical work capacity and a decrease in plasma ANP (ANP) and the rate of BNP in a dose-dependent manner. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, imidapril reduces urinary albumin excretion. Interestingly, improving imidapril dysphagia asymptomatic patients with a history of stroke. In the same patient, it increases the serum levels of substance P while the Angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan was ineffective. These studies show that imidapril is an inhibitor of ACE versatile. In addition to its effectiveness in the treatment of hypertension, CHF, and AMI imidapril has beneficial effects in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy and asymptomatic dysphagia. Good penetration in tissues and inhibition of tissue ACE by imidapril contribute to its effectiveness in cardiovascular complications of hypertension to prevent. The main advantages of imidapril are its activity in the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases and a lower incidence of cough in comparison with some of the older ACE inhibitors.",0

So basically about a year ago I was in the hospital for a week for an endoscopic surgery and when I got back from the hospital I had no responsibilities for about 5 months and I just stayed in my room on my computer for mostly all day and stayed up late doing this. I had little human interaction during that time because i wanted to be alone, and also for the past few 2 years leading up to the surgery my interaction with people was reduced significantly due to my eating disorder which made me isolate myself from people. Now when I am around people and even when i am alone in my room, I feel like I am not real and that nothing around me is real, and I am always afraid that I am dying or going to die soon from heart failure or forgetting how to breathe. Also, i cant focus in on anything and I feel like life is just passing me by so fast and I am not actually in my body because I have derealization symptoms. I was wondering is this because I have been separated from people for so long? Also, can this feeling go away?",1

Assistant Allison Borio says Mrs. Reagan died Sunday at her home of congestive heart failure. Her marriage to Ronald Reagan lasted 52 years until his death in 2004. A former actress, she was Reagan's closest adviser and fierce protector on his journey from actor to governor of California to president of the United States. She rushed to his side after he was shot in 1981 by a would-be assassin, and later endured his nearly decade-long battle with Alzheimer's disease. In recent years she broke with fellow Republicans in backing stem cell research as a way to possibly find a cure for Alzheimer's.

I stayed in hospital for two months, and don't forget that I had a severe stroke - I suggest Googling 'bleed on the brain NHS' and going to the bottom of the page and reading 'Outlook'. I would also look at 'midline shift'. I was discharged from the hospital with no advice and just my medication. The 18+ months since I have been out of hospital, have involved going to my GP for check ups, Warwick Hospital for gastroenterology and Leamington Stroke Rehab Hospital. It has been playing on my mind as to what really happened, which is why I decided to get my records. Plus the fact that nobody was/is telling me anything, I only found out that they detoxed me by accident, when I got hold of a report from the Rehab hospital to my GP and it was mentioned. As for your scenario, no it was a bit different. For 12 months I didn't have a drink, which was easy, I was in post strokemode with after effects and alcohol didn't really enter my mind. Then in the latter part of last year a few issues came into my life, as well as the age old one of I wonder what it feels like to drink (don't forget, up until yesterday, I didn't know that I had liver failure) and I started drinking. Shortly afterwards I told myself that it had to stop and went and saw my local alcohol recovery services - who I now know, were like every other one in the whole land, a complete waste of space. I tried telling them I was under the care of the liver specialist at the local hospital (they knew him - obviously had dealings with him) but they wouldn't even pick up the phone and speak to him. They wanted me to do 2 - 3 months of group therapy and drinks diaries before they would consider me. Not being one to accept no, I told them to shove it and got some diazepam off of my GP. Of course I wasn't ready, I did not understand the problem and a month later I was back on the alcohol. That's when I came here, to learn about the problems and the solutions, to do research on how I was going to tackle this. I learnt that Campral was probably the best medication for me, and I was probably not going to achieve it by will power alone. So the beginning of January this year, I got another prescription of diazepam and again detoxed. I then contacted the director of Addaction that I had complained to after my last visit and said I wanted another go at another branch, but didn't want to hit the same brick wall. And in fairness, he was very receptive when I first spoke to him and followed up with emails and he also sorted it out with the new branch. And that is how I ended up on Campral My current medication list is as follows and is subject to a 2nd anniversary review in June. Lactulose - Hepatic Encephalopathy Carvedilol - Congestive heart failure Thiamine - Short term memory & cognitive ability Amlolipine - Calcium channel blocker high blood pressure Spironolactone - Treats fluid retention as regards heart failure/cirrhosis Vitamin Compound B Strong - helps cirrhosis recovery Omeprazole - Esophageal Varices Folic acid - helps alcohol related damage Acamprosate - Alcohol anticraving I'm not sure how my liver is now, because nobody ever tells me. But I'm about to start getting more demanding. I have an appoitment with the gastroenterologist next month and I'm going to ask him a number of questions, along with, I want to see the blood test results and have them explained to me in detail, request my six month liver scan which I never had and ask them why I have not seen anyone to do with my heart medication, as he mentioned that I should never skip the Spironolatone or Carvedilol and I see he said the same to my GP in a letter that was in yesterday's records.",0

Green tea is a lot healthier than drinking soda or sugar filled juices. If you replace these unhealthy drinks in your day with green tea, you are bound to lose weight?but it?s not like you?re going to suddenly melt away pounds of fat just because of the tea. Although some studies have shown that green tea can boost your metabolism, energy levels and oxidation of fat, the studies are inconsistent about how much green tea actually helps you lose weight. So maybe chugging gallons of Starbuck?s green tea lemonades won?t help you get that swimsuit-ready body, but there are many other benefits to drinking green tea you may not know! 1. De-stress Teas are known to help you relax and green tea is one of the best ones to sip on as you take a moment to yourself. Green tea has a natural chemical called theanine which can provide a calming effect. So brew yourself a cup of green tea with a dash of honey (throw in a bit of ginger for that extra zing), and wash away your stress of the day! 2. It?s heart healthy A review of studies on green tea has shown that it helps to prevent a range of heart-related issues, from high blood pressure to congestive heart failure! Some scientists believe green tea works by keeping the lining of the blood vessels relaxed so it can handle blood pressure alterations efficiently. In addition to reducing blood pressure, there is also some evidence that the tea can protect against the formation of clots?the primary causes of heart attacks. 3. Got cholesterol? Green tea has been proven to reduce the bad cholesterol in your body while increasing the good cholesterol. The powerful antioxidant in green tea?Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG)?may inhibit absorption of cholesterol from the large intestine, which prevents an increase in bad cholesterol from greasy, unhealthy snacks and drinks. Research suggests that drinking at least five cups of green tea a day will help in reducing bad cholesterol. 4. It can make you smarter Of course, what is good for your heart is usually beneficial to the brain as well because you need healthy blood vessels in the brain. One Swiss study even revealed that people who drank green tea had more active working memory (short term memory). There are certain compounds in tea, like caffeine, that are stimulants which can improve brain functioning without the ?jittery? effects of caffeine-filled drinks such as coffee. 5. Lowers risk of Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s It seems that green tea may be able to block the formation of certain plaques that are related to Alzheimer?s disease. Some research has shown that this magical tea can delay the deterioration caused by both Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s disease. There is even evidence that it can help against dementia as well. Studies carried out on mice showed that green tea protected brain cells from dying and restored damaged brain cells. 6. Reduce the risk of cancer? Green tea is thought to kill cancer cells without damaging other cells, and has been shown to reduce the risk of certain cancers such as esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and even oral cancer. The EGCG in the tea is the powerful antioxidant that can kill cancer cells by destroying the cell?s mitochondria, which slowly leads the cancer cells to die. Some say it could even become a possible alternative to chemotherapy! 7. Improve oral health Although many people avoid tea due to the staining effect on teeth, green tea actually helps your oral health! A 2009 study published in the Journal of Periodontology found that the more green tea one drank, the lower the risk of periodontal disease. The catechin in tea helps reduce inflammation in the body, controls bacteria that can cause dental conditions like throat infections, and lowers the acidity of saliva and dental plaque?which prevents cavities. 8. Improves vision How does green tea help your vision? More antioxidants and catechins! Green tea can penetrate the tissue of eyes to produce and absorb antioxidants. A 2001 study published in the journal Experimental Eye Research found green tea can actually prevent cataract-induced blindness. 9. Protects your skin Apparently, green tea can also help with wrinkles and the signs of aging, thanks to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Multiple studies have proven that applying green tea topically even reduced sun damage. 10. Manage Diabetes Studies have shown that green tea also assists in stabilizing blood sugar in people with diabetes. Green tea regulates the glucose levels slowing the rise of blood sugar after eating which can prevent insulin spikes and the resulting fat storage.",0

However, if cardiac miRNA signatures prove to correlate with circulating miRNA signatures, they could HIV Integrase inhibitor mechanism be easily translated to clinical practice, facilitating patient classification, and potentially prognosis and treatment. Circulating blood miRNAs A number of studies have focused on the miRNA expression in HF patient peripheral blood. Among them, several have pointed to an increase in miR-423-5p, often combined with a number of other miRNAs. For example, it has been proposed that increased serum levels of miR-423-5p, along with miR-320a, -22, and miR-92 can be used to identify patients with systolic HF and correlate with clinical prognostic parameters such as elevated serum natriuretic peptide levels, a wide QRS (Q, R, S waves of an electrocardiogram) and dilatation of the left ventricle and left atrium. 129 Similarly, another group suggested that increased plasma levels of miR-423-5p can be a diagnostic biomarker of HF caused by DCM, while they correlated positively with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels. 130 However, it should be noted, that miR-423-5p has been investigated extensively in the context of multiple cardiac pathologies, with contradictory findings to date. Additional research is therefore needed, before final conclusions can be reached and findings are translated to the clinic. Voellenkle et al investigated the miRNA expression pattern of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in chronic HF patients suffering from ICM and nonischemic DCM. 134 This group reported that three miRNAs (miR-107, -139, -142-5p) were decreased in both patient groups, while each group also featured additional altered miRNAs, and specifically decreased miR-125b, -497 in ICM, and increased miR-142-3p,-29b in nonischemic DCM. Carfilzomib 134 These findings suggest that chronic HF has a distinct miRNA expression profile in PBMCs, along with etiology-dependent changes that may allow patient classification, upon further validation of these results. Prognosis Circulating miRNAs as prognostic markers In the context of identifying predictors of the development of ischemic HF in post AMI patients, the analysis of 377 miRNAs pointed to three p53-responsive microRNAs, namely miR-192, -194, and -34a, that were increased in the serum of patients who developed HF within one year of AMI onset. 131 Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between miR-194, -34a expression levels and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension.",0

As a result, FDA is adding new warnings to the drug labels about this safety issue. This Communication is an update to the 02/11/2014 FDA Drug Safety Communication. BACKGROUND: Saxagliptin and alogliptin are part of the class of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor drugs, which are used with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes. FDA evaluated two large clinical trials conducted in patients with heart disease. These clinical trials were also discussed at the FDA Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting in April 2015. Each trial showed that more patients who received saxagliptin- or alogliptin-containing medicines were hospitalized for heart failure compared to patients who received an inactive treatment called a placebo (see Data Summary in the FDA Drug Safety Communication for additional information). In the saxagliptin trial, 3.5% of patients who received the drug were hospitalized for heart failure versus 2.8% of patients who received a placebo. This is the same as 35 out of every 1,000 patients compared to 28 out of every 1,000 patients. Risk factors included a history of heart failure or kidney impairment. In the alogliptin trial, 3.9% of alogliptin-treated patients were hospitalized for heart failure versus 3.3% in the placebo group.

She was taken to a local hospital where she was then pronounced dead. The ANA-MPA reported that the women suffered from epilepsy and that the woman, unidentified, died from heart failure. Her death sparked outrage and protests to break out in the camp outside of Thessaloniki in northern Greece. Refugees are demanding better facilities, healthcare services and that an ambulance be in waiting outside of the camp, permanently. As a part of the protesters efforts to speak out and attract attention to create change, some 100 refugees piled onto a major road to block traffic for some time before returning without incident to the protest. The Greek government is in the process of phasing out migrant reception centers due to sub-par conditions at the camps. On Tuesday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) revealed their assessment of 16 migrant centers across Greece following health inspections earlier this month. The outlook was not good as KEELPNO determined that hundreds if not thousands of migrants have been crammed into reception centers with sub-par sanitation and living conditions. KEELPNO sent their long list of reasons why they are calling for the closure of all migrant reception centers in Greece to the Migration Policy, Defense and Health. Of the conditions observed was poor ventilation, migrants living on top of one another in cramped spaces having living quarters separated with nothing more than a sheet and lack of access to clean water and sanitation. Also, migrants having little access to health care is a concern that the government is trying to address, but with some 57,000 refugees currently in Greece, it is a slow process in seeing change.",0

Not just SVR means this but if the SVR is this and you gave this many mg of this type of med what would happen to (insert another swann number). It even asked me specific mg of an obscure cardiac drug that I would (prescribe) for a patient with CHF. The questions are random so you may get a rough test with a high number of killer hard questions or you may get a blend of reasonable questions. I took the test twice and noticed a significant difference in difficulty between the two tests, which is why you hear from some people that the test was ""easy"" for them. Good luck to you, drill those questions for a couple months until you're scoring probably an 80 or higher without much difficulty. Take the test, don't stress if you fail the first time.

It also doesn't seem to have the undesirable bloat/watertight associated with deca, again making it easier on your heart. Many who run npp liken it to trens little sister without the sides.

(""CTI BioPharma"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: CTIC ) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, Western District of Washington , and docketed under 16-cv-00216, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased CTI BioPharma securities: (1) pursuant and/or traceable to the Company's Registration Statement and Prospectus (collectively, the ""Registration Statement"") issued in connection with the Company's public offering on or about September 24, 2015 (the ""Offering""); and/or (2) between March 4, 2014 and February 9, 2016 , inclusive (the ""Class Period""). This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"").

CTI BioPharma is a biopharmaceutical company which provides medical research services, and develops clinical treatment and drugs for various cancers. One of the Company's most advanced pipeline products was pacritinib, a treatment for myleofibrosis. On September 24, 2015 , CTI BioPharma priced an offering of 10,000,000 shares, at a price of $1.57 per share. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose: (1) that pacritinib was attributed as a potential cause in the death and injuries of several patients; (2) that the Company's clinical trials showed the dangers of pacritinib usage; (3) that the Company's new drug application for pacritinib would likely be withdrawn; (4) that, as such, the Company's future revenues were impaired; (5) that the Company lacked adequate internal controls; and (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, the Company's financial statements and Defendants' statements about CTI BioPharma's business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On February 8, 2016 , CTI BioPharma issued a press release announcing that a partial clinical hold has been placed on pacritinib by the U.S. Food and Drug administration (""FDA""). Under the FDA's clinical hold, the Company, ""may not enroll new patients or start pacritinib as an initial or crossover treatment, and (ii) patients on pacritinib not deriving benefit after 30-weeks of pacritinib treatment should stop pacritinib."" The Company further disclosed that, ""[i]n its written notification, the FDA cited the reasons for the partial clinical hold were that it identified the following fatal and life-threatening safety issues in pacritinib-treated patients: heart failure, hemorrhage including intracranial hemorrhage, and arrhythmias including sudden death, and the FDA has also noted excess mortality in pacritinib-treated patients compared to the control arm in the PERSIST-1 clinical trial evaluating pacritinib."" On this news, shares of CTI BioPharma declined $0.68 per share, or over 60% to close at $0.44 on February 8, 2016 , on unusually heavy volume. On February 9, 2016 , the Company issued a press release announcing that the FDA had placed a full clinical hold on pacritinib. On this news the Company's shares fell over 40% during intraday trading on February 10, 2016 , on unusually heavy volume of over 15 million shares. The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York , Chicago , Florida , and Los Angeles , is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz , known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 80 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomerantzlaw.com CONTACT:",0

African American men are at the highest risk for heart disease, and more than 40 percent of African Americans have high blood pressure, a leading cause of heart disease and stroke. Altogether, nearly 44 percent of African American men and 48 percent of African American women have some form of cardiovascular disease that includes heart disease and stroke. Heart valve disease refers to a group of problems people experience with heart valves, the gatekeepers that open and close so blood can circulate correctly into and out of the heart chambers. . . Heart valve disease is not always easily diagnosed. Some people experience no symptoms at all, while others show very noticeable symptoms, which can develop quickly if the condition is severe. A heart valve diagnosis may seem overwhelming, but with proper treatment, most people are able to recover and return to a normal, healthy lifestyle. The American Heart Association and American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) recently launched a program designed to help the millions of Americans diagnosed every year with heart valve disease. The Heart Valve Ambassador Program is an effort to raise awareness about heart valve disease, support others struggling with the disease and share available resources with patients and caregivers. The AHA/ASA ambassadors make up a volunteer-based group of heart valve disease survivors and caregivers who are leaders in the patient community. As survivors they understand the physical, emotional and social impact heart valve disease can have on patients and caregivers. By sharing their personal experiences, the ambassadors help those newly diagnosed with the disease understand what to expect and reassure them they?re not alone. Heart Valve Ambassador Robert Epps shared his personal story with me in order to offer help and hope to others. The retired U.S. Coast Guard Sr. Chief Petty Officer underwent open heart surgery after his heart valve issues were detected during a regular check-up. He went on to found the National Organization for Aortic Awareness. Also joining him was American Heart Association Spokesperson Eldrin Lewis, M.D., M.P.H., who discussed more information about heart valve disease and the Heart Valve Ambassador Program. . Take a listen to our chat below. . Word For more information, visit: www.heart.org/heartvalves . .

This is because I have to be responsible for any medical condition called instead uimujik Clerk vacancy, all medical requests of inmates will go through with me. Monday - Friday work is similar to, but significantly different from a similar piece of work often pushed to Monday prohibitive. One patient complained of symptoms over the weekend + is due to come into a lot of new detainees will also be considered. What is it like any other job. Resting comfortably now that hard to prepare for the weekend to work on Monday. Now today issued two months of receiving a day. The first month it was really gone hard, and now going to go this time so come early this weekend unawares. The new work is reduced, repeating the same things looked up did not come as a big stimulus Is Now? When really trying repetitive routine of having the largest memo. Anyway, I wanted to try briefly about the process of what I least once. <Care> medical advances to significant new entrants care, medical tours, accompanied by three medical configurations. - Initiate treatment reclamation law, inmates will receive an unconditional basic CBC, BC entrance examinations. It looks like every other small items we Cattle Hb / Hct, RBC, and the WBC + LFT (AST / ALT, Gamma GTP) + Glc (PP2) by default, makes a further inspection in accordance with the patient. In a significant number of patients with alcoholism has by default if LFT has shown every time the red ... Sampling procedure sees that the guards were responsible for care and progress, even if not read as much as would a large referral hospital in the Green Cross made an accurate examination kkoena. In the meantime, the new place is greatly 6: divided in a ratio of 1: 3. 60% (in this case should eat about alternative medicine as in the original address, or if you have eaten or prescription) who come to the hospital regularly attending carrying directions, 30% of hospitals do not care ... let alone self-administration bodies people (usually are able servitude), the remaining 10% are sweet and intensive care units coming over the five problem list. The 10% ... is that people look inspiring motivation ... itinerant care: Jeju There shall all suspense / Convict Boards exist because there is no jail. 'Cause this type was determined look that is acceptable to split into andoeeot nyareul standards. Add to women prisoners are confined separately in Sadong women. Itinerant health care obligations is as I say official seals shall be looking out for each visit turns east. Go undetected copper / copper gigyeol / sister to the medical care conjures the applicant in each such office. This is a view that can not be 100% focused care is not in fact true because the doctor's office. In fact, there is not even a place consisting of both small solitary pines, as medical officer ... why this is still a question what to visit. Looking for someone to ease the discomfort of others think that this practice is indeed taking ... who want to set. What is the problem again consider whether uimujik Clerk vacancy (this part is not just the only itinerant medical practices). - Accompany treatment: treatment will usually accompany prisoners to medical care, emergency medical care did not see when touring the infirmary. If you come find a lot of popping up when you leave because the tour is coming patient care and sporadic differently. In the meantime, place accompanied by treatment seems to be 50/50. If a real emergency comes up and the other half when the half. <Test> -Lab: This inspection is made, ask your company data, usually being used because of the advent of useful results within 1-2 days. CBC, BC, U / A, LFT, TFT, Coagulation profile, Lipid profile, Vit, Allergic test (IgE, MAST), various infections test (HBV, HCV, Viral; HIV, HSV, CMV, RPR, TPHA, etc.) Tumor marker, it is possible to Rheumatic marker so many tests. - Video: Video is where the report generator and writing. It has the X-ray generating apparatus it is possible to save the desired portion. Of new entrants CXR, regular checkups, being used can be useful for patients with musculoskeletal system. CXR mainly include Old TBc, Cardiomegaly, and filter out the SPN, etc., in the case of musculoskeletal read this difficult ... Looking at the pictures taken with the possible symmetry groups are trying to differentiate Fx. <Others> - Consult: Often, when the health status of prisoners is severe enough to affect the sentence whether the medical officer in charge of finding this important work. The type of patient with severe enforcement stops can be found if you called representative. In fact, I went through three inde case to date (originally referred to one case per year ... this year, many toxic), Esophageal ca. 2A is a stage of the CCRT case, Lung ca stage 3 of Chemo case and CHF & 3 vessel disease of CABG case. In fact medically stop the sentence because treatment that requires hospitalization, and all three cases it is considered in cases in which it is desirable to receive the treatment. The final judgment will be released describing easily possible medical information to decision-makers will, because my role is responsible for the inspection. - Chulyeok addition of detainees, and deliver the findings of such punishment. 2016. 6.16",0

I've been short of breath, getting hot flashes, and really super nauseous. Also my appetite is gone. Let me give a bit of history here. I am 26, but been extremely sedentary for the past 8 years. I haven't really done much of anything, so i've gotten like no exercise at all. I also have had an awful diet, eating lots of fast food. I am not overweight at all, in fact I probably need to gain some. My cardiologist and the ER doesn't seem to take this very seriously due to my age, because they think it's nearly impossible to have clogged arteries at my age. Couldn't my lifestyle and diet make this possible though? I have had a few tests, which I will list below. EKGs. Some come back abnormal. One even said something about ST depression but both the doctors and people here said it was nothing to worry about. Echocardiogram. Showed slightly reduced ejection fraction of 48%. Otherwise normal. Nuclear Stress Test. The test showed normal perfusion. Blood tests. Last time I was at the ER weeks ago, they checked CBC, metabolic panel, troponin, lipase, d-dimer, thyroid. Troponin T 0.01 ng/mL. They said it's normal. Holter monitor. Did this before the chest pain started, but it came back okay. My question is could with all these tests could I be having angina pain? Is it possible that the nuclear stress test missed a blockage? Or is this 100% confirmed to not be the heart at this point? My symptoms seem to be getting worse, which is why i'm very concerned. They don't want to do an angiogram on me because i'm 26. I just don't know what to do next. Also this isn't a GI problem because i've been to the gastroenterologist too. I'm really scared these are symptoms leading up to a heart attack, and that my arteries are clogged. I am 26, male, 5'11, 145 pounds, white.",1

Sources told FOX Sports on Thursday that Randleman had been admitted to a San Diego hospital for pneumonia and later passed away due to heart failure. He had been living in Las Vegas. Long before he was one of the most feared men in the Octagon, Randleman was already a legend on the mats during his years at Ohio State, where he followed in the footsteps of another UFC icon, Mark Coleman. Randleman was a fierce wrestler who captured two NCAA wrestling championships and was a three-time All-American. Once college was finished, Randleman decided to follow Coleman into the UFC, where he would soon gain a reputation as one of the most powerful and explosive fighters in the history of the sport. Randleman debuted in the UFC in 1999, and three fights into his career he was already the heavyweight champion of the world. Randleman defeated Pete Williams to win the vacant title and then went on to defend it against Pedro Rizzo in June 2000. In 2002, Randleman ventured to Japan, where he became a fixture in PRIDE Fighting Championships, which is where he would spend the next four years while taking on some of the best competition in the world. One of Randleman's biggest moments came in a 2004 fight against Mirko ""Cro Cop"" Filipovic, who was a massive favorite in the PRIDE heavyweight grand prix that year. Randleman floored the former kickboxer with a huge punch early in the first round before finishing the fight a few seconds later with some vicious ground and pound. Randleman's win is still considered one of the most shocking moments in the history of the sport. From there, Randleman bounced back and forth between wins and losses for the remainder of his fighting career before his last bout took place in 2011.

Without it, the other side effects are muchmore unlikely. I never took Actos, but for a number of years took a similar med, Avandia, which got pilloried by what I thought were baised interpretations of some studies at a time when people were looking to dump on the pharmaceutical industry. Avandia did get the black box warning, although later studies have questioned whether it was justified--the later studies seeem to suggest maybe it is not so bad. One poster here, CM Keyes, if I have his name right, swears by it, and has gone to FDA hearings to testify in favor ot it. I eventually stopped taking it because I had macular edema, and one study showed that it could cause macular edema in 1 out of 10,000 patients taking it. When I stopped, I discovered that like metformin, it really had very little effect on my personal blood sugar levels, incidcating that the problem it addresses was not the source of my high blood sguar levels. Both Actos and Avandia work by lowering insulin resistance at a cellular level, so that the insulin that you have can more effectively transport the glujcose inyour blood to the cells of your muscles and organs, both supplying you with energy and lowering your blood sugar. When I started taking it, these two were the only drugs that specifically focused on that issue. Since then other drugs have been developed, some of which claim to address that as a secondary mode of action. These newer drugs, however, also carry the risk of dangerous side effects, so it may be a case of pick your poision. With most of them however, including Actos, the incidence of the dangerous side-effects is on a relatively small minority of the people taking them, even if the potential is severe. This is unlike metfoirmin which causes a minor side effect, gastro-intestinal distress, very annoying but it disappears when you stop taking met, on about half of all users... With Actos though, AFAIK, the edema, usually in the ankles, is a clear sign that one of the very rare side effects, congestive heart failure, is possible--so stop taking it; however I don;t know if there is any easy way to know if you would be one of the very small minortiy who might be bladder cancer in the long run..",1

Something could have titled the newspapers of the time the discovery made in 1949 epidemiologist Jerry Morris. This Scottish researchers studied two types of workers other than London buses, drivers and collectors. Both were men of similar social environments, but the first heart attacks suffered far more often than the latter. The difference seemed to be that drivers spent all day while sitting collectors had to move constantly up and down the stairs between the two floors of those vehicles. After confirming the correlation had been observed, he published their findings in The Lancet, in what is considered the first scientific evidence of the link between disease and physical inactivity. Since then, many other scientific studies have confirmed that exercise is good for health, but how much is necessary to have benefits? In a study published this week, a group of Swedish researchers, after analyzing nearly 40,000 people aged between 20 and 90 years old, has concluded that more than one hour of moderate exercise or half hour of intense exercise a day can reduce the risk of heart failure by 46%. The work, which is now published in the journal Circulation, began in 1997 and included people who then did not suffer heart failure. The Swedish team of scientists found that more active as was a person, the lower their risk of autism. This study has also confirmed that, although a greater amount of exercise provides greater benefits, even low levels of activity can have positive effects. In addition to promoting exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle, the article's authors, researchers at the University of Uppsala, consider designing cities in which walking or cycling move easy and safe can provide great health benefits. The explanation for the benefits of physical activity occur, among other things, because during exercise the muscle contracts more frequently and power, increasing blood flow to the arteries. This causes subtle changes in the autonomic system that controls the contraction and relaxation of the blood vessels and eventually reduce the number of resting heart rate, lowers stress and helps to have a heart capable of beating in a wider range. All these factors reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition, exercise has been associated with a reduction of inflammation, which is usually involved in diseases such as arteriosclerosis. Exercise slims little Although the link between exercise and health not arouse too many doubts, not so with that between sport and thinning, a motivation that often drives more people to move the state your arteries. In the case of moderate exercise, if deemed to walk a kilometer consume about 70 calories a day five kilometers are traveled, that would mean an extra intake of about 350 calories a day. While quantity is important, a kilo of fat contains about 7,000 calories, thereby maintaining the usual diet weight loss process would be very slow and may produce demotivation. For now, it seems that the main method to lose weight and stay healthy one is to reduce the number of calories consumed. In any case, as shown by the Swedish study confirming previous work, even a small amount of exercise that does not make us sylphs can help us be better. A study led by Chi Pang Wen, National Health Research Institutes in Taiwan, analyzed the physical activity levels of 400,000 Taiwan for eight years. In this group, they found that even people who did just 15 minutes of exercise a day were 14% less likely to die in those eight years later and increased their life in three years on average compared to inactive people. The article also mentioned that, in addition to reducing the risk of heart disease, the quarter of an hour of exercise could have avoided one in nine cancer deaths among those who did not perform any physical activity. Finally, they tried to see if what happened was that the most active people had, overall, a healthier lifestyle. And it was not. When factors such as drinking alcohol or smoking were separated, it was observed that the benefits of sport for health were still present.

In type 1 diabetes, you lack insulin, and what kills you (in the long run) if not treated (with insulin) is high sugar level, in type 2, insulin is just not effective enough anymore to regulate sugar level.

Hispanic and Latino people in the U.S. have a high risk of heart pumping problems that can lead to heart failure, but most who have these disorders don?t know it, a recent study suggests. Researchers examined heart ultrasounds for more than 1,800 Hispanic/latino adults in four U.S. cities and found about half of them had cardiac dysfunction that put them at increased risk for heart failure, a chronic disease that happens when the heart can?t pump enough blood to keep the body healthy. But fewer than 1 in 20 of these patients with cardiac dysfunction knew they had a problem, the authors report in the journal Circulation: Heart Failure. This may be at least in part due to the lack of symptoms, at least initially, said lead author Dr. Hardik Mehta of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Hispanics are particularly vulnerable to heart pumping problems because they are more likely than other people to have risk factors for heart failure such as diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure, Mehta and colleagues note. ?The prevalence of risk factors has been known to be higher, but now we know that the prevalence of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction is also very high,? Mehta said by email. ?When compared with other ethnicities with high risk factors, like non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics still have a higher prevalence of cardiac dysfunction,? Mehta added. To assess the risk of heart pumping problems among Hispanic and Latino adults, Mehta and colleagues studied people between the ages of 45 and 74 in New York, Chicago, Miami and San Diego. Patients were 57 years old on average and 43 percent were men. Roughly 32 percent were Cuban Americans, 20 percent Mexican Americans, 18 percent Dominican, 17 percent Puerto Rican, 6 percent Central American and 6 percent of South American descent. About half of participants had what?s known as left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, when the lower left chamber of the heart doesn't relax enough between beats to gather enough blood. About 4 percent had what?s known as left ventricular systolic dysfunction, when the heart?s largest chamber doesn?t push blood out into the body as forcefully as it should. Risk factors for these types of cardiac dysfunction ? high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, limited activity and smoking ? also put these patients at higher odds of developing heart failure, the authors note. The findings suggest that Hispanic/Latino patients would benefit from screening for diabetes and other risk factors to help catch problems before heart failure develops, said Dr. Andrew Krumerman, a researcher at the Montefiore Einstein Center for Heart and Vascular Care in New York who wasn?t involved in the study. ?Patients should ask their primary care physicians about screening,? Krumerman said by email. ?They should seek out exercise programs and begin to increase their activity level, while making healthy choices when it comes to their diet.? It?s important for doctors to also understand that Hispanic isn?t a precise racial or ethnic group, it?s a cultural and social way people may describe themselves when they have origins in many parts of the world, said Dr. Keith Ferdinand, a researcher at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans who wasn?t involved in the study. ?Hispanics can be white, black, Asian, or as in most cases, of mixed heritage,? Ferdinand added by email. ?Each individual needs to be assessed based on his/her risk and not on somewhat artificial categories.? At the same time, all patients, including Hispanics, should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of heart failure, said Dima Qato, a pharmacy and health outcomes researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago who wasn?t involved in the study. These include shortness of breath, persistent cough and fatigue, Qato said by email. For some Hispanic patients, it?s also possible moving to the U.S. may have led them to adopt unhealthy American habits like eating junk food and sitting in front of the television too much, said Dr. Kevin Thomas, a researcher at Duke University who wasn?t involved in the study. ?Acculturation to the U.S. has led to decreased activity, obesity and worse health outcomes,? Thomas said by email. SOURCE: http://bit.ly/23ck8Su Circulation: Heart Failure, online April 5, 2016.",0

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has strengthened the existing warning about the risk of acute kidney injury for the type 2 diabetes medicines canagliflozin (Invokana, Invokamet) and dapagliflozin (Farxiga, Xigduo XR). Based on recent reports, we have revised the warnings in the drug labels to include information about acute kidney injury and added recommendations to minimize this risk. Patients should seek medical attention immediately if they experience signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury. This is a serious condition in which the kidneys suddenly stop working, causing dangerous levels of wastes to build up in the body. Signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury may include decreased urine or swelling in the legs or feet. Patients should not stop taking their medicine without first talking to their health care professionals. Doing so can lead to uncontrolled blood sugar levels that can be harmful. Health care professionals should consider factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury prior to starting them on canagliflozin or dapagliflozin. These include decreased blood volume; chronic kidney insufficiency; congestive heart failure; and taking other medications such as diuretics, blood pressure medicines called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Assess kidney function prior to starting canagliflozin or dapagliflozin and monitor periodically thereafter. If acute kidney injury occurs, promptly discontinue the drug and treat the kidney impairment. For more information, please visit: canagliflozin and dapagliflozin.",0

I'm am acutely aware of the actuality and to have 7 day diagnostics will be very, very expensive. Senior consultants/ doctors do not carry out or perform elective diagnostic tests in the NHS or the private sector, despite what everyone sees on 'House'. Respiratory physiologists, cardiac physiologists,neurophysiologists, vascular scientists, audiology physiologists, MLSOs, sonographers etc carry out diagnostic tests using specialist equipment and report on them. The report is then uploaded to the patients medical records for the doctor view. For example the team I used to manage recently were cardiac physiologists and echocardiographers - The ultrasound for heart failure is an echocardiogram - carried out by a BSE registered sonographer/echocardigrapher- not by a junior doctor.

Manny Crisostomo mcrisostomo@sacbee.com i By Cathy Locke A childhood fascination with airplanes and trains led Richard Denison to join the U.S. Army Air Forces as a navigator during World War II and later to a civilian career devoted to preserving railroad history. Denison was aboard a ?Gooney Bird? C-47 aircraft on D-Day in June 1944, swooping behind German lines and launching a glider plane carrying artillery gunners for the 82nd Airborne. In recognition of his 42 combat missions as a U.S. Army Air Forces bombardier and navigator helping liberate France from German occupation, Denison was awarded France?s highest military honor, the Chevalier medal of the French Legion of Honor. The medal was presented by the French consul general in 2011 in a ceremony at the California State Railroad Museum, where Denison was employed as a researcher and served 13,000 hours as a volunteer after retiring from the military. Denison died in Sacramento on April 1 of congestive heart failure after suffering from pneumonia, said his daughter Carol Denison. He was four weeks shy of his 95th birthday. Despite three strokes and two bouts of cancer, her father remained active until recently, Carol Denison said. ?He always said, ?When the elephant lies down, the jackal will get him,? ? she recalled. 42 the number of combat missions Richard Denison flew as a navigator during World War II Richard H. Denison was born April 30, 1921, in New Albany, Ind., to Charles and Maude Denison. He was the eldest of six boys. Five saw military service, while a sixth became a Methodist minister to ?look out for the rest of us,? Richard Denison wrote in a brief summary of his life. As a youth, he became interested in building model airplanes. He attended several flying meets, winning third place in an Indianapolis American Legion contest. Denison worked 40 hours a week at a grocery store to earn money to come to California, where he could earn a degree in aeronautical engineering in two years. But after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, he left college and went to work for the Douglas Aircraft Co. before he was drafted. He entered the U.S. Army Air Forces and graduated as an aerial navigator. He married Betty Jane Schmidt in December 1943, a month before he departed for England. The couple were married 73 years. Denison earned honors including the Distinguished Flying Cross and five battle stars in World War II. In 2011, when he received the Chevalier medal, he told a Sacramento Bee reporter, ?I was just an average guy who was drafted and had to do things that I could not conceive that I would have ever been able to do.? He was discharged from the Army Air Forces in December 1946 and entered the Air National Guard in January 1947 as a full-time administrative officer. He was recalled to active duty for the Korean War. Denison became the base commander at the Air National Guard base in Van Nuys in 1961, and later became the project officer for converting five groups of F-86 fighters to C-97 transports at Travis Air Force Base. He then was transferred to Sacramento and became the project officer for converting the C-130 for ?water bombing? in fighting forest fires. Denison was promoted to brigadier general upon retirement from the Air National Guard in 1976 and turned his attention to trains. I was just an average guy who was drafted and had to do things that I could not conceive that I would have ever been able to do. Richard Denison, upon receiving the Chevalier medal of the French Legion of Honor in 2011 ?He never worked for the railroad, but he could tell you everything about the history of the railroad,? said Carol Denison. A model railroad enthusiast, Denison went to work for the California State Parks system, heading a team of nine researchers charged with ensuring the historic accuracy of railroad equipment being restored in advance of the opening of the California State Railroad Museum in 1981. He later worked in the museum?s exhibit section. Upon retiring from state employment in 1990, he became a docent at the museum. Marilyn Sommerdorf worked with Denison for more than 30 years as an employee and volunteer at the railroad museum. She and Denison, both avid photographers, spent three days at Stanford University photographing hand-painted illustrations of Baldwin locomotives. Philadelphia-based Baldwin Locomotive Works was one of the world?s largest and most influential builders of steam locomotives, and the materials in the Stanford archives are important to those doing restoration work. Summerdorf said she and Denison provided copies of their photographs to Stanford and the Smithsonian Institution, as well as the California State Railroad Museum. Denison often said of the locomotive restoration, ?We?re doing 19th-century work in the 20th century,? Sommerdorf recalled. 13,000 the number of hours Richard Denison spent as a volunteer with the California State Railroad Museum Carol Denison said part of what kept her father young in spirit was cultivating friendships with people who were younger than he was. Bruce Kleinshmidt met Richard Denison when he began working as a docent at the railroad museum in 1981. Although 30 years younger than Denison, Kleinshmidt said the men shared many conservative views. They met regularly for lunch over the years, talking about history and about Denison?s war experiences. ?He would get choked up over some of the stories, and especially friends he had lost,? Kleinshmidt said. Richard Denison is survived by his wife, Betty, of Sacramento; daughters Carol Denison of Sacramento and Christine Nekl of Colorado Springs, Colo.; four grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by a granddaughter. A celebration of his life will be held at noon Thursday in the California State Railroad Museum Theater, at Second and I streets in Old Sacramento. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be sent to the California State Railroad Museum Foundation.",0

I'm now 70. I've had a Heart Ablation where extra electrical pathways that had developed in my heart were Lasered out. I have had 2 Major Heart Attacks both with Cardiac Arrest. I had a Triple Heart By Pass and my Main Aorta which was in a very bad state repaired, my Suregeon said that in his opinion it had been leaking for 20 years. Over all those years l had SVT ( Supra Ventricular Tachycardia) and AF ( Atrial Fibrillation ) and Chronic Angina. !! 14 months after my By Pass surgery l had to have a Scaffold ( the latest , most modern kind of Stent ) inserted into my 4th Artery because in that short space of time that Artery which was completely clear when l had my By Passes had clogged up very badly, that was why l was still having horrendous Angina. I couldn't even go into the Cold Aisles in the Supermarket, l had to stand at the end and tell my husband what to get. I also have End Stage 5 Kidney Disease and have Dialysis 3 days a week. I also have Osteoporosis and Osteo Arthritis, all my life l have suffered with Bi Polar and with Borderline Persoality Disorder. I tell you all this because l've always found that seldom do diagnosis or prognosis go straightforward. There are often differing soft opinion whereas one doctor or specialist/ Cardiologist will tell you one thing or and another one , or even two will tell you something completely different. My Cardiologist blamed a lot of my trouble ei. Weight gain , fluid retention etc. on my Kidneys and my Nephrologist would blame it all on my heart. I had to have my first Major Heart Attack before they would sort themselves out and agree. I often felt that l was banging my head on a brick wall trying to get through to them. My advice is to talk to your GP and ask for as many tests that they can do. A 7 day ECG where you would have the machine( they are tiny now compared to the bricks l had to carry around years ago) attached to you for 7 days which gives a much longer and more thorough picture/ reading of the behaviour of your heart. Ask to go on the Treadmill, Ask for an Angiogram. The best way to put your mind at ease or at least know what you're coping with is to persist and really drum it home to them how worried you are. One of my friends who had absolutely no signs or symptoms of any kind of heart trouble did this because her father sat down one day and just died !!! He was only 50 years of age. She asked for an Angiogram and it was discovered that even though she was fit as a fiddle with no signs of heart disease two of her Arteries were blocked ,She had a double heart by pass and because she wasn't ill to begin with she made an extremely quick recovery and was back working, swimming and running in no time at all. I hope this is of some help to you. I had my first Heart Attack in Asda and my second on my 66th Birthday on our way to Asda !!!! All my Family and Friends advised me to do our shopping in Morrisons in future !!!! LoL. Good luck. Let's know how you get on. Yours Sincerly. Mo Ashton.",1

Ask those people who have these chubby cheeks and double chins on their bloated faces. They just want to get rid of all the face fat. But how to lose this fat on face? While losing weight is always a task that needs determination and continuous efforts, losing weight on face needs a lot of extra efforts. In fact, a bloated face is not only a matter of looks but it may indicate a serious health issue. Let?s see why we get a fat face! Causes for Facial Fat Here are the top reasons why your face looks all blown up when you see it in the mirror every time, more so in the mornings. Junk Foods Whenever you eat those burgers and pizzas, try to evaluate the nutrients in them! Did you find any? They are pure ?junk?! You need all the vitamins and minerals and other essential nutrients to look at your best. To be specific, lack of vitamin C and beta carotene can make your face bloat. Not only this, whenever you eat such foods, you are pushing carbohydrates and salt into your system. These two things too cause puffiness of face. So, start having balanced diet full of nutrition. Fruits, vegetables and herbs are good for losing weight, not only on face but from all over your body! Dehydration This is due to water retention. When your body craves for water and doesn?t get it, it tends to retain water. Face is one of the areas where your body can retain more water. So, start drinking lots of water. If it isn?t possible for you, have more of watery fruits and vegetables as well as healthy drinks. Aging When you age, the hormonal changes inside your face leads to bloating and puffy face. However, it?s not too hard to delay these aging symptoms. Just eat right (the nutritious balanced diet) and exercise a lot while maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Alcohol Do you drink a lot? If yes, expect your face to become puffy and fat. Why does this happen? This is because alcohol dehydrates your body. This leads your body to again retain water which makes your face look fat. So, cut back on your alcohol consumption. Heredity Sometimes it may be your genes that give you a fat face. While you cannot do a lot in such a situation, you can at least try to tone your facial muscles with some toning exercise. Medical conditions Facial fat is not always due to the above causes. It can be a symptom of something that?s not right in your body. For example, kidney problems, sinus infections, allergies, insect bites, mumps, dental issues, edema etc. Take steps to treat these conditions and you?ll get rid of your facial fat. Now when you know what might be causing your facial weight, you may definitely try to eliminate that cause and lose your facial weight. But the question is, how to do so? How to Lose Weight on Face There is a three pronged approach for losing face fat: Lifestyle and diet changes Face exercises Home remedies Lifestyle Changes for Losing Facial Weight Drink Water This is the most essential step you can take to keep yourself away from body weight, including facial fat. Drinking enough water throughout the day will keep your body hydrated to a level where it would not require to retain water and give you a bloated appearance. Drink 8-10 glasses of water daily Have more water based fruits and vegetables like cucumber, tomatoes, watermelon etc. If you can?t drink plain water, have healthy drinks like fruit juices, herbal tea, vegetable smoothies, soups etc. Limit Salt Consumption Salt leads to water retention in your body. This happens because your body tries to dilute the salt with larger amounts of water. This not only makes your face look fat but also leads to serious health issues. Too much salt intake puts pressure on your heart and may lead to heart failure or stroke over time. You may also get kidney problems due to excessive salt consumption. So, stop taking too much of salt. But how? Cut back on processed and fast foods. They are loaded with salt. Instead have more fruits and veggies. Avoid sprinkling salt on each and every food item you eat. All natural foods have adequate amounts of salt. You need not add more salt to them. It is a matter of few days only when you will start liking foods with low salt levels. Have lots of water to help your body flush out the excessive sodium you have stored in your body through salt intake. Have natural diuretics as they eliminate sodium and water from your body. Cranberry juice and cabbage are good examples of such natural diuretics. Eat more potassium-rich foods. Potassium balances sodium in your body by flushing out water and sodium out of the body. Bananas, carrots, spinach, raisins etc. have high amounts of potassium in them. Have them daily. Have Balanced Diet Wholesome diet loaded with all the essential nutrients will not only reduce facial weight but will help you lose weight from all over your body. Have more fresh fruits. Avoid having canned or preserved fruits. They might contain sugar, sodium or other preservatives that can further lead to bloating and weight gain. Have more vegetables. Fibers in the vegetables help eliminate toxins from your body which is essential to lose weight. They also give you all the essential minerals and vitamins. Don?t skip meals and eat your meals regularly, preferably on the same time every day. This helps in better digestion. As you might be knowing, indigestion is the cause of almost all the diseases. Eat smaller meals many a times instead of 2-3 big meals. This will help boost your metabolism so that you get rid of fat. Avoid Junk Food Processed as well as fast foods, all are junk foods. Avoid them. This would help you avoid excessive salt and carbohydrates. You should know that unhealthy carbohydrates are a big reason for fat as they lead to bloating. Avoid packed foods Avoid processed foods Reduce the frequency of visits to restaurants. Eat more home cooked food Eat more raw foods, fruits and vegetables by adding them in salads Instead of such snacks as cookies, biscuits, popcorns etc. snack on dry fruits, peanuts, date, coconut etc. Take enough Rest Lack of sleep can give you puffy eyes, dark circles, saggy skin, fine lines and wrinkles etc. all of which can make you look aged and sometimes bloated. So, have enough rest by sleeping for adequate time every day. Also, not taking rest breaks during work can make you over stressed that will lead to various medical conditions including bloated body and face. Take breaks from work frequently. Sleep enough every day. Try to go to bed at the same time everyday and wake up at the same time in the morning, even on holidays. This sets a rhythm of your body and you can sleep easily. If needed, you can learn some meditation techniques. Calming your nerves and mind can give you deep rest and relaxation. Correct your Posture If you are in a habit to sit wrongly, correct it now. Hunched back can make your face look fat. Additionally, it also leads to double chin. Always stand straight. Do not bellow your face down while talking or walking. This can make the fat get stored in your chin area. Exercise Exercise is the healthier way to keep your body fit and fine. When you exercise regularly, you help your body work naturally. Your metabolism improves and you start losing weight. When you lose weight, it is obvious that fat on your face too reduces. Move your body daily, be it walking, swimming, cycling, dancing, do whatever you like, but move it. If possible, do intense exercise, at least 2-3 days a week, such as cardio, aerobics, yoga or any other such exercises. When it comes to facial weight, you also need to do face exercises. The next section deals with this elaborately. Source;http://www.rapidhomeremedies.com/",0

About 600,000 people are living with heart failure - an incurable, long-term condition where the heart is not pumping enough blood due to damage from heart attacks and disease, says the Heart and Stroke Foundation study. That growing number is putting a strain on patients, their families and the economy, says David Sculthorpe, CEO of the foundation. ""There is so much we need to do as more Canadians develop this chronic, incurable condition - from earlier diagnosis to better end-of-life care and, ultimately, finding ways to help heal these damaged hearts."" Depending on the severity of symptoms, about half of heart-failure patients die within five years and most will die within 10 years, the report says. Even with excellent care, heart-failure patients face tough challenges. Marc Bains was a fit 23-year-old when he was diagnosed in 2008 after a cold virus attacked his heart and reduced its function to only 10 per cent. He was put on a heart transplant list and had a tiny defibrillator implanted in his chest. Bains's health improved with treatment, exercise and an improved diet to the point where he was taken off the transplant list, but over the years he has had three cardiac arrests. In 2014, he collapsed on a squash court after his defibrillator failed. He spent five days in an induced coma in hospital and two weeks in intensive care.

To gain the grandeur of lifesaving devices called automated extrinsic defibrillators, the US Food and Drug Administration proposed Friday that the seven manufacturers of these devices be required to get intervention leave for their products. Automated surface defibrillators (AEDs) are carriable devices that deliver an electrical shock to the stomach to try to restore normal heart rhythms during cardiac arrest muscle relaxants. Although the FDA is not recalling AEDs, the energy said that it is interested with the number of recalls and quality problems associated with them. And ""The FDA is not questioning the clinical utility of AEDs,"" Dr William Maisel, captain scientist in FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said during a push meeting on Friday announcing the proposal. ""These devices are critically vital and function a very important public health need. The standing of early defibrillation for patients who are suffering from cardiac arrest is well-established"". Maisel added the FDA is not racket into question the safety or quality of AEDs currently in town around the country. There are about 2,4 million such devices in clear places throughout the United States, according to The New York Times. ""Today's fight does not require the removal or replacement of AEDs that are in distribution. Patients and the societal should have confidence in these devices, and we cheer people to use them under the appropriate circumstances"". Although there have been problems with AEDs, their lifesaving benefits preponderate the risk of making them unavailable. Dr Moshe Gunsburg, numero uno of cardiac arrhythmia service and co-chief of the diremption of cardiology at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center in Brooklyn, NY, supports the FDA proposal. ""Cardiac nab is the chief cause of death in the United States. It claims over 250000 lives a year"". Early defibrillation is the passkey to helping patients survive. Timing, however, is critical. If a unswerving is not defibrillated within four to six minutes, perceptiveness damage starts and the likelihood of survival diminish with each passing minute, which is why 90 percent of these patients don't survive. The best stake a patient has is an automated visible defibrillator used quickly, which is why Gunsburg and others want AEDs to be as reciprocal as fire extinguishers so laypeople can use them when they see someone go into cardiac arrest. The FDA's undertaking will help ensure that these devices are in excellent shape when they are needed. Read more ?",0

Snopes................ It is known Robert Atkins did indeed weather a heart attack during his lifetime. In April 2002, the diet guru issued a statement saying he was recovering from cardiac arrest related to a heart infection he had suffered from ""for a few years."" He said it was ""in no way related to diet."" However, revelations in February 2004 from the city medical examiner's report let slip the information that Atkins had suffered a heart attack, congestive heart failure, and hypertension, before his death. The report was given to the Journal by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a group that advocates vegetarianism. Because the medical examiner's office is claiming this information was circulated in error, it may not be possible at this time to determine if what was in that report referred to events that immediately preceded (and therefore might have caused) the doctor's death, or if they were in reference to damage done over the course of a lifetime. (The report had been sent to a doctor in Nebraska who requested it. It was later discovered the person it was sent to was not ""the treating physician"" and so should not have had access to the report.) At present, the medical examiner's office will only say Atkins died of a head injury from the fall. ""I can't comment on people's previous conditions. It's against the law,"" said spokeswoman Ellen Borakove. It needs be kept in mind that even if the medical examiner's office does become more forthcoming, it still may not be able to answer the question of whether a heart attack brought about the demise of Dr. Atkins. An autopsy was not performed on him because of family objections to the procedure. Consequently, the medical examiner conducted only an external exam and a review of Atkins' hospital records.",0

( SRPT ), a developer of innovative RNA-based therapeutics, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration?s (FDA) Peripheral and Central Nervous System Advisory Committee (PCNSC) met to review the new drug application (NDA) for eteplirsen as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy amenable to exon 51 skipping. The advisory committee voted 6-7 against the finding of substantial evidence from adequate and well controlled studies that show that eteplirsen induces production of dystrophin to a level that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit (FDA Question #2). The advisory committee voted 3 ? 7, with three abstentions, against finding substantial evidence based on the clinical results of the single historically controlled study (Study 201/202) that eteplirsen is effective for treatment of DMD (FDA Question #7). ?We would like to thank the hundreds of patients and families who participated in the discussion today, underscoring the critical unmet need of people living with Duchenne.? said Edward Kaye, M.D., Sarepta?s interim chief executive officer and chief medical officer. ?We appreciated the opportunity to present our data to the advisory committee panel and will continue to work with FDA as they complete their review of the eteplirsen NDA. Today more than ever, we remain committed to our mission of bringing a treatment to the Duchenne community.? DMD is a rare degenerative neuromuscular disorder causing severe progressive muscle loss and premature death. The FDA is not bound by the Advisory Committee's recommendation but takes its advice into consideration when reviewing New Drug and Biologic License Applications in general. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date for completion of FDA review of eteplirsen is May 26, 2016. In three additional voting questions, the panel voted 5 to 7, with one abstention, against whether decisions to administer the 6-minute walk test (vs. conclusions that the patient could no longer walk) were sufficiently objective and free of bias and subjective decision-making by patients, their caregivers, and/or health care professionals to allow for a valid comparison between patients in Study201/202 and an external control group (FDA Question #4). The panel voted on the impact of the North Star Ambulatory Assessment with one panel member voting that it strengthened the persuasiveness of the findings in Study 201/202, with five voting that it weakened the persuasiveness, and seven voting that it had no effect (FDA Question #5). The panel also voted on the impact of the other tests of physical performance (e.g., rise time, 10-meter run/walk) on the persuasiveness of the findings in Study 201/202, with the result of one panel member voting that they strengthened the persuasiveness, two voting that they weakened the persuasiveness, and ten voting that they had no effect (FDA Question # 6). The PCNSC Advisory Committee recommendation was based on a review of results from the Phase IIb clinical program for eteplirsen (studies 201 and 202), long-term outcomes (through 168 weeks) from the Study 202 open-label extension study, as well as 4-year clinical effectiveness data based on a comparison of patients in Study 201/202 to a historical control group that was designated as a major amendment to the NDA in January 2016. About the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) The 6MWT was developed as an integrated assessment of cardiac, respiratory, circulatory, and muscular capacity for use in clinical trials of various cardiac and pulmonary conditions. In recent years, the 6MWT has been adapted to evaluate functional capacity in neuromuscular diseases and has served as the basis for regulatory approval of a number of drugs for rare diseases, with mean changes in the 6MWT ranging from 28 to 44 meters. Additionally, published data from longitudinal natural history studies assessing dystrophinopathy, a disease continuum comprised of DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy, support the utility of the 6MWT as a clinically meaningful endpoint in DMD. These data show that boys with DMD experience a significant decline in walking ability compared to healthy boys over one year, suggesting that slowing the loss of walking ability is a major treatment goal. About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy DMD is an X-linked rare degenerative neuromuscular disorder causing severe progressive muscle loss and premature death. One of the most common fatal genetic disorders, DMD affects approximately one in every 3,500-5,000 males worldwide. A devastating and incurable muscle-wasting disease, DMD is associated with specific errors in the gene that codes for dystrophin, a protein that plays a key structural role in muscle fiber function. Progressive muscle weakness in the lower limbs spreads to the arms, neck and other areas. Eventually, increasing difficulty in breathing due to respiratory muscle dysfunction requires ventilation support, and cardiac dysfunction can lead to heart failure. The condition is universally fatal, and death usually occurs before the age of 30. About Eteplirsen Eteplirsen is designed to address the underlying cause of DMD by restoring the messenger RNA (mRNA) reading frame, thus enabling the production of a shorter, functional form of the dystrophin protein. Eteplirsen uses Sarepta?s proprietary phosphorodiamidate morpholine oligomer (PMO) chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. Approximately 13 percent of the DMD population is amenable to exon 51 skipping. Data from clinical studies of eteplirsen in DMD patients have demonstrated a consistent safety and tolerability profile and have also shown measurable dystrophin protein expression. Promoting the synthesis of a shorter dystrophin protein is intended to slow the decline of ambulation and mobility seen in DMD patients. There currently is no approved treatment in the United States for DMD and eteplirsen has not been approved by the FDA or any regulatory authority for the treatment of DMD. About Sarepta Therapeutics Sarepta Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics for the treatment of rare, infectious and other diseases. The Company is primarily focused on rapidly advancing the development of its potentially disease-modifying DMD drug candidates, including its lead DMD product candidate, eteplirsen, designed to skip exon 51. Sarepta is also developing therapeutics for the treatment of rare, infectious and other diseases. For more information, please visit us at www.sarepta.com .

Results of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) appear in the current online issue of the New England Journal of Medicine and were discussed today at the American Heart Association 2015 Scientific Sessions in Orlando. The study confirms that, in adults 50 years and older with high blood pressure, targeting a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) reduced rates of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and heart failure, as well as stroke, by 25 percent.

I had a feeling of diminish appetite but not to the extreme, i ate small but frequent, I rinse my mouth everyday with baking soda and salt to ensure not to have any mouth sores, I tried to move as much as I can on a daily basis, I did feel tired, nauseated (drank frequently lots of water) soreness in the muscles, joints, numbness in the bottom of my feet, hands ( did frequent stretching & yoga poses). unfortunately for some odd reason, I was the small percentage who run into heart issues due to herceptin and luckily enough I was part of a research team who monitored my heart since the beginning of my treatment with AC. As soon as they found out I had congestive heart failure, they put me on medication and stop the herceptin for 2 weeks and my heart went back to normal.

There was no other interfering peak around selleck the retention time of ethacridine lactate; also, the base line did not show any significant noise. Accuracy The accuracy of the method studied at three different concentration levels, that is, 80%, 100%, and 120% showed affordable % recoveries in the range of 98.90-100.15 % for ethacridine lactate. The results are shown in Table 3. The low value of % R.S.D. indicates accuracy of the method. Table 3 Recovery studies Sensitivity The LOD for ethacridine lactate was found to be 0.11 ??g and the LOQ for ethacridine lactate was found to be 0.33??g. The low values of LOD and LOQ indicates adequate sensitivity of the method. Robustness and ruggedness study Robustness of the method was studied by making deliberate changes in the chromatographic conditions and the effects on the results were examined. The content of the drugs were not adversely affected by these changes as evident from the low values of % relative standard deviation (less than 2%) indicating robustness of the method. When the method was performed by two different analysts under the same experimental and environmental conditions it was found to be rugged. Analysis of marketed formulationSix replicates of the sample solution (20??L) were injected for quantitative analysis. The amount of ethacridine lactate estimated was found to be 99.52%, respectively. A good separation and resolution of the drug indicates that there was no interference from the excipients commonly present in pharmaceutical formulation. System suitability test According to USP, system suitability test is an integral part of liquid chromatographic methods. They are used to verify that the resolution and reproducibility of the chromatographic system are adequate for the analysis to be done. An earlier prepared solution for chromatographic conditions was tested for the system suitability testing. The results obtained from validation of the method and system suitability studies are summarized in Table 4. Table 4 Summary of the validation parameter and system suitability study CONCLUSIONS The developed RP-HPLC method is simple, precise, accurate, selective, and reproducible. The method has been found to be adequately rugged and robust and can be used for the determination of ethacridine lactate in pharmaceutical formulation.

Use of Cancer Clinical Pathways for Patients,"Washington, DC [April 21, 2016] ? Because sequenced care plans, called clinical pathways, now shape the treatment decisions for an increasing number of cancer patients, an initiative called Project Innovation unveiled Decoding Clinical Pathways, the first online resource for the public that explains what pathways are and how they affect cancer care today. The goal is to help patients understand factors that are shaping their care, and if theirs is governed by a pathway so they are better prepared to weigh available treatment options with their physician and care team. Project Innovation is a campaign to elevate advancements in cancer treatments as a national priority. Coinciding with the publication of the policy paper, ?Recommendations for the Role of Clinical Pathways in an Era of Personalized Medicine,? on April 13, 2016 in the American Journal of Managed Care, the new module comes at a time when the use of pathways is expanding and evolving. Authored by cancer specialists working with the National Patient Advocate Foundation (NPAF), the paper reports that many hospitals and physician practices now use pathways to translate published medical practice guidelines into the essential steps for treating a specific disease or condition. When properly designed and implemented, these pathways help steer patients and providers to evidence-based treatment options that take into account such factors as efficacy and safety along with cost. However, the NPAF paper cautions that pathways can also be oriented more towards ?cookie-cutter? approaches that can preempt shared decision-making between doctors and patients and interfere with physicians? clinical judgement. This is of increasing concern as insurance companies implement their own care plans as a way to control costs and in some cases, pay bonuses to doctors for prescribing ?on pathway? treatments. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) estimates that 60 individual health plans are currently implementing oncology pathways, particularly for breast, lung and colorectal cancers. Responding to these developments, the online guide introduces the concept of pathways to patients and caregivers, most of whom have never heard the term before, and serves as a primer on the purpose of these care plans, the likely benefits of patient-focused pathways and the potential limits restrictive versions may impose on available treatment options and patient access to emerging personalized therapies. The Decoding Clinical Pathways module is available on the Project Innovation website at: www.projectinnovation.org ?For too long, the discussion about cancer clinical pathways has been limited to physicians, insurance companies and policymakers even though patients are directly affected by how these care plans are designed and what they cover,? said Alan Balch, PhD, chief executive officer of the Patient Advocate Foundation (PAF), which manages Project Innovation. ?Our goal is to equip patients and caregivers with user-friendly information about pathways so they will know what questions to ask and be prepared to weigh treatment options with their oncologist.? The Need for Transparency Today, clinical pathways are used to manage cancer and other challenging diseases, such as congestive heart failure and diabetes. When applied to cancer care, these protocols are intended to allow oncologists and patients to weigh treatment regimens based on different safety and effectiveness profiles, improve outcomes and drive value in the health system. Conversely, some pathways erode the doctor-patient relationship and the overall quality of cancer care by limiting or precluding treatment options that may be appropriately personalized to an individual patient, which is why the NPAF policy paper states: ?Patients need to be aware, not just of how options on pathways were chosen, but also of what other alternatives are viable, according to guidelines, that may not be listed in the pathway. Patients can then have an honest consultation with their physician about the various risks, benefits, and costs associated with each viable option.? Reflecting this position, ASCO published a policy statement with nine recommendations to improve clinical pathways and the National Patient Advocate Foundation issued a set of Guidelines for Clinical Pathway Design and Development, calling for all clinical pathways to support shared decision-making and reflect patients? preferences for how to individualize their care. However, until these recommendations are enacted, the online module encourages patients to take action themselves by asking these questions of their oncologist: Is my treatment determined by a clinical pathway? If so, what treatment options are available through the pathway for my diagnosis and why were they chosen? Does the pathway include the option of enrolling in a clinical trial? What happens if the most appropriate treatment is not covered by the pathway? Are there ways that the health plan will cover this treatment? Does the insurance plan give financial incentives to the oncology practice for following the pathway? Further, the online module recommends patients and caregivers take advantage of new rules under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which require insurance companies to make available in concise, easy-to-understand language what their health plans cover. Ways to get information on the drugs covered through the health plan are to: Visit the insurer?s website to review the list of prescriptions the plan includes Ask the insurance company to provide the ?Summary of Benefits and Coverage,? a form that summarizes the key features of the plan, such as the covered benefits, cost-sharing provisions, and coverage limitations and exceptions Call the insurance company directly to find out what drugs are covered About Project Innovation Launched in June 2014 and spearheaded by the Patient Advocate Foundation (PAF) and National Patient Advocate Foundation (NPAF), Project Innovation is a national movement designed to accelerate the pace of medical discovery in cancer, deliver safe and effective breakthrough therapies to patients quickly and save lives. Through Project Innovation and its complementary policy development initiative, the Cancer Innovation Coalition, stakeholders have joined forces to address the barriers slowing the pace of biomedical research and limiting patient access to much needed treatment.

Science NewsA service of the American Association for the Advancement of Science PUBLIC RELEASE: 29-FEB-2016 Single dose of trastuzumab kick starts immune response in certain breast cancers CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY A tumor's immune response to a single dose of the HER2 inhibitor trastuzumab predicted which patients with HER2-positive breast cancer would respond to the drug on a more long-term basis, according to the results of a study published recently in Clinical Cancer Research. In addition, Vinay Varadan, PhD, assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and member of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, and his colleagues found that women with the HER2-enriched subtype of HER2-positive breast cancer--a subtype that is estrogen and progesterone receptor negative--had the highest rate of immune response to treatment with trastuzumab, with significant increases in immune response after a single dose of the drug. ""Our study showed, for the first time, that the immune-cell-activating properties of trastuzumab are likely related to the subtypes of breast cancer,"" Varadan said. ""Knowing this can inform future trials studying the usefulness of adding immunotherapy drugs to trastuzumab."" Only one-half of women with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab will have their tumor completely respond to therapy prior to undergoing surgery to remove the mass. Even when a second HER2-targeting drug, such as pertuzumab, is combined with trastuzumab, only 60% of women have a complete response. Therefore, there is a need to find ways to identify women who are the most likely to respond to this presurgical treatment. Prior research showed that a patient's own immune system can play a role in determining whether the tumor will respond to therapy with trastuzumab. To look into this association further, Varadan and his colleagues used data from two clinical trials to measure the molecular makeup of breast tumors after treatment with a single dose of trastuzumab. They examined how and if the immune system interacted with the drug and if the immune-associated properties of trastuzumab were related to the subtype of HER2-positive breast cancer. Women with the HER2-enriched subtype of disease had the highest rate of tumor response compared with other disease subtypes in patients taken from both clinical trials. Based on these results, Varadan and colleagues used a molecular signature (Immune Index) to measure the amount of immune activity occurring within the tumor tissue. Again, the HER2-enriched subtype tumors had significant increases in immune activity after only one dose of trastuzumab compared with the other subtypes. ""We found that higher Immune Index evaluated after just one dose of trastuzumab predicted the tumor's response,"" Varadan said. This response seems to be specific to trastuzumab. There was no association between immune activity and the subtype of breast cancer in patients who were given a single dose of another chemotherapy. ""Also, the predictive ability of the Immune Index test was not observed in patient tumors before any therapy was given, suggesting that just a single dose exposure may be a beneficial way to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from trastuzumab-based chemotherapy and, thus, do not need additional anti-HER2 treatment,"" Varadan said. Finally, the researchers wanted to identify which types of immune cells were associated with this brief exposure to trastuzumab. They found that signatures of T-cell activity--a key immune response--were consistently predictive of response after one dose of trastuzumab, suggesting that the immune system is likely playing a key role in enabling the therapeutic benefits of trastuzumab. Specifically, PD-1 expression, a marker of T-cells, was significantly increased in women with the HER2-enriched subtype of disease. This suggests that this subtype of breast cancer may benefit most from the addition of drugs that target PD-1. ""Given that the subtypes of HER2-positive disease and the immune signatures predict response to trastuzumab-based therapy, the next question is whether these signatures can also predict response to dual-HER2 targeted therapyVaradan said. ""Additionally, we would like to understand why certain breast cancers have a strong immune response when treated with anti-HER2 therapy while others escape immune surveillance. We are poised to answer these questions using both lab-based research as well as an ongoing preoperative clinical trial--CASE14112--being conducted here at CWRU."" ### For more information about Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine: http://www.case.edu/medicine Disclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system. ? ? ? ?

I'm nervous about uterine cancer and the what the delay will do and the hysterectomy itself and now enlarged heart. The cardiologist did not give me any clue to what's next he gave me the information and walked out. I was surprised at what he had just said that I didn't stop him from leaving.

TOO MUCH H20 CAN ACTUALLY BE DANGEROUS,"If you?ve ever tried to lose weight, you?ve probably heard a lot about water and weight loss. Can drinking more water really help you lose weight? The short answer is yes ? and no. If you?re already well hydrated and getting plenty of water, getting more water into your diet probably won?t make a lot of difference. But if you?re going through your days a little ? or a lot dehydrated, as many people are, getting enough water could help. Dr. Christopher Calapai, D.O. is a Manhattan Osteopathic Physician board certified in family medicine, and anti-aging medicine. He states that, ?There is always the case of too much of a good thing. Some people are such water drinking devotees that they are aquaholics, resulting in overhydration.? As a result, experts now fear we?ve become so focused on staying hydrated that we?re guzzling water to life-threatening extremes. Dr. Calapai points out that, ?There are two types of overhydration: Increased water intake and retaining water. Increased water intake?or drinking more water than the kidneys can get rid of in the urine?can cause too much water to collect in the body.? When the body is unable to get rid of excess water, it is said to be retaining water. This happens with several medical conditions, for instance. It can be dangerous because it throws off the balance between water and sodium in the blood. Overhydration caused by drinking too much water can occur both consciously and unconsciously. Dr. Calapai says that, ?A person may drink too much water during exercise. Some medications can also cause dry mouth and cause an increase in thirst. Increased thirst can also be caused by uncontrolled diabetes. Psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia (primary polydipsia or psychogenic polydipsia) can also cause compulsive water drinking.? What Are the Symptoms of Overhydration? Symptoms of overhydration may not be recognized in the early stages but can include: Nausea and vomiting Headache Changes in mental state (confusion or disorientation) If left untreated, overhydration can lead to dangerously low levels of sodium in the blood (hyponatremia). This can cause more-severe symptoms, such as: Muscle weakness, spasms or cramps Seizures Unconsciousness Coma How Can Overhydration Be Prevented? Endurance athletes can reduce the risk of overhydration by weighing themselves before and after a race to determine how much water they have lost and need to replenish. Dr. Calapai emphasizes that, ?Individuals should avoid drinking more than one liter per hour of fluid. Drinking more fluids before and during a race or anintensive athletic exertion can also help you avoid the need to drink too much water afterwards. Sports beverages that contain the electrolytes sodium and potassium are also recommended, as both are lost in sweat.? So how do you know how much water you need? For starters, don?t rely solely on thirst, says Calapai. ?As soon as you put water on your tongue, you kill your thirst mechanism.? Instead, he suggests the following: Weigh yourself daily for a week, to check hydration. ?Your body weight shouldn?t fluctuate too much,? Calapai says. Notice how much you pee?and its color?in the morning. It should be a copious amount and pale or clear. Aim to wake feeling hydrated. If you?re thirsty when you get out of bed in the morning, you may not be consuming enough fluids. When choosing sports drinks, search for labels with low sugar. Dr. Calapai recommends about 5 grams per 8-ounce serving. ?Even natural drinks like coconut water have too much sugar and potassium to hydrate.? Coffee, tea, and watery fruits and vegetables count toward fluid intake. ?Also, caffeine is not a diuretic,? Dr. Calapai says. ?It?s about volume, so if you drink five cups, you?ll pee more.? Start slowly. ?Sleep is a six- to eight-hour fast, so if you drink three cups of juice or water right away, you?ll trigger the volume response. Sip instead.? If you have an underlying medical condition, such as diabetes, congestive heart failure, or kidney problems, talk to your doctor about the best treatments for those conditions. If you experience excessive thirst or an overly strong urge to drink water, contact your doctor before you develop symptoms?it could indicate a medical problem that requires treatment Dr. Christopher Calapai D.O.

By Wendy James, RHIA, PMP The technological advances that have taken place over the past 25 years have been nothing short of phenomenal. When I reflect on the things I have experienced, not only in my professional career, but the technological advances I have seen over the course of my life across the board in all facets of life, the effect is staggering. From safety-oriented upgrades we now take for granted like lap seatbelts and cars equipped with airbags, to the improbably yet amazingly real home monitoring system that notifies me whenever there is anything out of the norm, from climate control to movement at the front door. Think about it? who would have ever guessed this would be the type of environment we would live in today? Technology has also been advancing in the healthcare industry. Suppose someone very close to you just had a major health event and has been admitted to the hospital. As health information management professionals that are ?in the business,? so to speak, it could be said we are at a slight advantage to know that being admitted to the hospital may not result always in the best outcome, and are on the lookout for potential issues. Whether we like to think it or not, we know what can and sometimes does happen. For those who are not as informed, an incredible amount of trust and faith is given to those who are now caring for your loved one. When I think about those who are not familiar with healthcare, I get concerned because many times they do not have an advocate that is independent of those caregivers. Take for example someone diagnosed with atrial fibrillation which not only presents itself as a more enlarged heart on a scan, but also is somewhat of an irregular heartbeat. When this person presents in the emergency room, if there is no one there as an advocate for this person, this person might receive medications because their blood pressure is not normal. These medications then cause the patient to hallucinate, which then might cause a misdiagnosis by the caregivers who are unfamiliar with this person. A patient?s best defense is many times a loved one who remains diligent and passionate, asking questions each step of the way on the journey through the hospitalization. What may be normal for your loved one is not normal for someone else. So how can our health information actually save a life? How many times have you entered in your demographics in triplicate, during the same episode of care for the same facility? We document our medications, we document our date of birth, we document our health history, we document our allergies, we document our past surgeries, we document our known problems? but who really reads it? To the caregiver, it?s just data, but to me or my loved one, it?s my health story, one that I am passionate about, one that I want to protect. Not every patient is going to have an advocate available to them at all times while in the hospital. For those who do, they are lucky. There have been many times having that loved one in the room with you might have saved your life. Perhaps they questioned a medicine or questioned why a certain procedure was necessary. One of the challenges today?s patients face is the general lack of continuity of care, limited knowledge of the patient?s history, or the robotic response to automated and/or scheduled orders without consideration of the current conditions. Having an advocate present is sometimes nothing short of being a lifesaver. The ability to provide such an ardent advocate for each patient is not currently possible or feasible. But what if it was? A new smart phone application, developed by Larry Trach at EMRConnect, is currently being tested that will provide a giant step forward in helping a patient safely navigate a hospital stay. This application will monitor data streams from the hospital?s electronic health record from three different subject areas: Registration and admit discharge transfer (ADT) messages Provider access of your patient record Clinical results like labs, vital signs, and other pertinent documentation Registration and ADT monitoring After registration is completed, you will be able to visually verify your demographic information, guarantor and emergency contacts, insurance information, advance directive, and providers assigned to your case. A registration system is susceptible to human and interface errors, such as registration overlays, bad medical record or account combines, and system interface errors. If any of your key demographics change during the course of your stay, you would be immediately alerted. Monitoring Provider Access Not all damage or injury is a result of medical malpractice. Inappropriate access to your health information by someone who is not on your care team can be a signal for identify theft, loss of confidentiality, and more. You will be able to see all the providers that accessed your record, what their role was, and what they did on your behalf. If you question a particular activity or access, a review request can be sent directly to the designated privacy officer or security team. Clinical Monitoring for Predicting Harmful Conditions Vital signs and labs can be good predictors of vital stress, over sedation, early detection of sepsis, and many other conditions or adverse events. Each time a new result arrives; it will be reviewed, scored, and combined with other key measures, risk factors, and co-morbidities. Because of the dynamic and sometimes chaotic nature of activities on the nursing unit, it is easy to miss a key piece of new information, such as a critical lab value, not to mention the latencies between time of care and time of documentation. The monitoring application would allow a patient or the patient?s designee to receive messages about their healthcare. There would be remote access for monitoring and message capability thus improving communication among all of the appropriate caregivers. If we can wire our homes to provide us with up-to-the-minute information, in the interest of safety and security, then we should certainly be able to apply this same technology to healthcare. After all, there is nothing more important than saving a life.

(NASDAQ:EGRX) (?Eagle? or the ?Company?) today announced that it has entered into an agreement with the National Institutes of Health (?NIH?)/National Institute on Drug Abuse (?NIDA?) to explore the use of Ryanodex? in the treatment of hyperthermia related to MDMA (?Ecstasy?) and Methamphetamine intoxication, which is a life-threatening condition mostly affecting adolescents and young adults. The preclinical studies will be conducted by NIDA beginning in the summer of 2016 utilizing a well-characterized animal model. Initial results of the focused studies are anticipated in late 2016 or early 2017. ?We believe that Ryanodex has the potential to provide benefit to patients experiencing pathological thermal dysregulation associated with the use of Ecstasy and Methamphetamine? ?We are very pleased to be working alongside the NIH to explore the potential of Ryanodex to reduce elevated body and brain temperature resulting from the use of Ecstasy and Methamphetamine. Results of our recently completed clinical study of Ryanodex for Exertional Heat Stroke indicated that patients receiving Ryanodex in addition to standard of care (SOC) -- which is currently limited to body cooling and supportive measures -- experienced an incremental therapeutic benefit over patients receiving SOC only,? said Scott Tarriff, President and Chief Executive Officer of Eagle Pharmaceuticals. ?We believe that Ryanodex has the potential to provide benefit to patients experiencing pathological thermal dysregulation associated with the use of Ecstasy and Methamphetamine,? stated Adrian Hepner, Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer. ?We anticipate that having positive outcomes from our preclinical studies would enable us to meet with FDA and potentially lead to a rapid transition into pivotal clinical trials. Clinical studies in emergency settings are of relatively short duration due to the nature of the disorder and the known distribution of cases of ecstasy and methamphetamine intoxication, commonly associated with large holiday celebrations.? ?The development of Ryanodex for body and brain hyperthermia associated with intoxication from illicit psychostimulant drugs in a preclinical model in collaboration with NIDA experts, will be an important step forward in addressing the serious consequences of this condition,? added Hepner. Brain hyperthermia is one of the leading causes of severe morbidity and death in MDMA (?Ecstasy?) and Methamphetamine intoxication. In 2011, the last year for which data is available, 125,000 emergency room visits were related to Ecstasy and Methamphetamine use. Methamphetamines are the fourth most reported illicit drug in emergency room visits following cocaine, marijuana, and heroin. And, according to the Drug Abuse Warning Network (?DAWN?), the number of emergency room visits involving Ecstasy among patients younger than 21 increased 128 percent between 2005 and 2011. MDMA (?Ecstasy?) 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as ?Ecstasy? or ?Molly?, is an illicit, synthetic drug that alters a user?s mood and perception. MDMA increases the activity of three brain chemicals: dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin. It is chemically similar to both stimulants and hallucinogens, producing feelings of increased energy, pleasure, emotional warmth, and distorted sensory and time perception. MDMA can also affect the body?s ability to regulate temperature, leading to a spike in brain and overall body temperature that can result in liver, kidney, or heart failure and even death. MDMA is a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act. Schedule I drugs have a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Methamphetamine Methamphetamine, also known as ?meth?, ?crystal?, ?chalk?, and ?ice?, is an extremely addictive stimulant drug that is chemically similar to amphetamine. It takes the form of a white, odorless, bitter-tasting crystalline powder. Methamphetamine increases the amount of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is involved in reward, motivation, the experience of pleasure, and motor function. Methamphetamine?s ability to release dopamine rapidly in reward regions of the brain produces the euphoric ?rush? or ?flash? that many users experience. Repeated methamphetamine use can easily lead to addiction. The consequences of methamphetamine abuse can cause memory loss, aggression, psychotic behavior, damage to the cardiovascular system, malnutrition, and severe dental problems. Methamphetamine abuse has also been shown to contribute to increased transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV/AIDS. Methamphetamine is classified as a Schedule II drug, available only through a prescription that cannot be refilled. According to data from the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), over 12 million people, 4.7 percent of the population, have tried methamphetamine at least once. Methamphetamines are known to cause hyperthermia which can contribute to Meth-induced neurotoxicity and mortality. About NIDA The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports most of the world?s research on drug abuse and addiction. Its mission is to advance science on the causes and consequences of drug use and addiction and to apply that knowledge to improve individual and public health.

Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2016 Apr 22; Authors: Tran HA, Lin F, Greenberg BH Abstract INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of heart failure (HF) has increased globally in recent decades. Advances in our understanding of underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms have given rise to new therapies for treating the growing HF population. Nonetheless, morbidity and mortality associated with HF and its financial implications are daunting. Thus, novel therapies that can improve the natural history of HF patients are urgently needed. Areas covered: This article reviews new investigational drugs being developed for the treatment of both acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). It presents the background of these drugs with a focus on their mechanism of action, their pharmacology, evidence from clinical studies and their potential role in HF management. Expert opinion: The mortality benefit associated with serelaxin treatment in the RELAX-HF trial is being tested in RELAX-AHF II, while two other drugs, ularitide and TRV027, are also being evaluated in ADHF patients. Two new agents for the treatment of chronic HFrEF, LCZ696 and ivabradine, have been recently been approved for use by the FDA and four novel agents which have shown considerable promise in early studies, omecamtiv mecarbil, vericiguat, finerenone, and neuregulin, are currently being evaluated in late-phase clinical trials.

And to maintain the temperature and keep the body cool, the heart is forced to pump blood at a faster rate. While most people tolerate these changes without any problem, those with damaged or weakened heart are at a high risk of heat stroke, dehydration, arrhythmias, angina and heart attack, which in some cases might be fatal. So to keep your heart healthy during summer, here are five tips from our expert Dr Sanjay Kumar, HOD Principal Consultant ? Cardiology Fortis Escorts Hospital, Faridabad, you need to keep in the mind. 1. Stay hydrated: According to Dr Sanjay, dehydration is a known trigger for atrial fibrillation and stroke. As summer causes excess loss of fluid from the body, it is important to stay hydrated by drinking fluids such as water, coconut water, soups and juices. People above the age of 50 years fail to recognise that they are thirsty and often become victims of dehydration and heat stroke. Hence, ensure to drink water frequently, even if you are not thirsty. 2. Choose medications wisely: People suffering from heart disease and hypertension are often prescribed diuretics, also known as water pills. However, when taken during summer, it might worsen dehydration by increasing the urine output. Even, the consumption of antidepressants and antihistamines can also block sweating thereby further worsening the condition. If you feel dizzy or light-headed, check with your doctor immediately regarding reducing the dosage fo the medication during summer. 3. Limit the consumption of caffeinated or alcoholic beverages: It goes without saying that the consumption of alcoholic beverages or caffeinated drinks during summer might trigger dehydration, thereby increasing your risk of heart complications. Also, people who have undergone angioplasty or those with stents and artificial heart valves need to be more cautious as dehydration might cause thickening of the blood, which can cause blocking of the stent. Hence, it is wise to load up your intake of water. Here are 11 heart-healthy drinks. 4. Limit outdoor activities: It is always advisable to exercise outdoors, but during summer, it is important to ease the strain on the heart caused by the summer heat. Hence, limit outdoor activities like brisk walking, running or gardening to evenings and not in the morning. It is advisable to stay indoors during the morning and afternoon hours when the temperature is the highest. If you are planning to workout, wear light-colored clothes and those made from breathable fabric like cotton. You may like to read about 5 exercises that help you cope after a heart attack. 5. Consult your doctor if you suspect anything wrong: Patients with coronary heart disease may get episodes of angina during summer due to increased pressure on the heart and the heightened demand for oxygen. Moreover, these people are at high risk of suffering from atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. Hence, it is critical for people with heart disease to stay healthy and take necessary precautions when the temperature rises. If you suspect any symptoms of heat stroke, visit nearest hospital immediately to avoid any causality.

Our commercial team has and will continue to execute on our strategy to broaden and diversify our base of customers and expect to deliver accelerating revenue growth through the launch of our PLAC? Activity Test."" Preliminary total revenues, comprised entirely of product sales, for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 were approximately $3.5 million, consistent with $3.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenues reflect the loss of one of the Company's largest customers for the PLAC? ELISA Test, Atherotech, which filed for bankruptcy March 4, 2016, an increase in PLAC? ELISA Test volumes from other customers, and growth in PLAC? Activity Test volumes from new customers. Diadexus' second FDA-cleared test PLAC? Activity was launched actively in the fourth quarter of 2015. Preliminary cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2016 were approximately $6.3 million. These preliminary results and balance are unaudited and may be subject to adjustment prior to Diadexus reporting financial results for the first quarter 2016, expected on or around April 28, 2016. About Diadexus, Inc. Diadexus, based in South San Francisco, California, is a diagnostics company developing and commercializing products that aid in the prediction of cardiac disease risk, providing healthcare providers with actionable information for managing patients. The Company pioneered the testing of Lp-PLA2, a marker of vascular-specific inflammation that provides new information, over and above traditional risk factors measured in a lipid panel, and has over a decade of peer-reviewed literature validating its utility. Diadexus' products, The PLAC? Test ELISA Kit, first cleared by the FDA in 2003, and The PLAC? Test for Lp-PLA2 Activity, cleared in December 2014, are the only two FDA-cleared tests to measure Lp-PLA2. The Company also has a pipeline of biomarkers for heart failure, proADM, proET-1 and proANP, each of which provide distinct, additive information for healthcare providers over currently available markers.

HRs can also be elevated due to caffeine, anxiety, and dehydration. For those HRs on the high end of normal, doctors will most likely just recommend exercise. The more you workout, the lower your resting HR will be. Conditioned athletes will often times have resting HRs in the 40s. If exercise doesn't bring any changes, the doctor may further assess the situation. It's ALWAYS important to see your doctor if you have any concerns. Better safe than sorry. I have Wolff Parkinson White where I have an extra electrical pathway that can cause rapid and irregular heart rates. I kept having shortness of breath and I could feel my heart racing. I was blown off and told it was just anxiety until I refused to leave the emergency room and demanded they further looked into it. That's how I found out I even had Wolff Parkinson White. My resting HR was 110-120. When I would run, my heart rate would hit 190. I am currently taking a beta blocker for it so my heart rate now stays around the 70-80s at rest. When working out my HR now won't go above the 150s. I am doing an ablation to permanently correct the problem (as long as there are no complications) and then I can get off the medication.

What we should do is look for the cause of this problem and propose a targeted treatment. First, it is important to explain what it means myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction, also known as heart attack is when a piece of the heart is destroyed. Once destroyed, that area will no longer contraction function and the rest of the heart will have to work more to address the lack of that piece. When this piece destroyed is bigger, causes larger contraction deficits, including severe heart dysfunction and can cause death of patients. Second, when there is loss of contractile function of the heart loses some of its ability to pump blood forward and liquids become accumulated in various parts of the body, especially the lungs, causing pulmonary edema. This fluid accumulation in the lungs is responsible for the sensation of breathlessness. Then, I believe the heart attack you had, may have destroyed a large area in your heart, leading to a condition known as heart failure. And there are several treatments for this problem, incuindo cardiopulmonary rehabilitation, medications and visits by multidisciplinary team. I suggest you contact your cardiologist for further information and determine which therapies are needed to solve the problem. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help you. Wish you good health.",0

I have been gone so long I forgot how to start a thread. This post has NOTHING to do with this subject matter, just something I discovered. Somewhere there is a thread talking about the evils of statin meds, like lipitor and crestor, for managing high cholesterol. My cholesterol is ok but my cardiologist wants me to take lipitor anyway. Years ago I remember the posts about how bad these drugs are, so I have limited my intake of it without my cardiologist's knowledge. Anyway, I have had congestive heart failure for years, among many other ills, which the oldtimers here know. As part of managing congestive heart failure, I take lasix, which is a diuretic. Since stopping/curtailing the lipitor, I have not had to take lasix in quite some time. The edema (fluid buildup) in my legs has lessened to the point I don't need it. The only explanation I have is the lack of lipitor in my system. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO DERAIL THIS THREAD, and I apologize. If it were not for the previous discussion about statins, I would still be having a heck of a time with too much fluid buildup. I may not be back to see replies, but I may, who knows. Winnie, Hey Winnie, nice to see you're back! I don't want to add to the derail, therefore only so much: In February, my heart basically ripped itself apart and I was dead - literally. After several months in hospital, which included an open heart surgery, I am back amongst the living. for now.

During last night's broadcast of UFC Fight Night: MacDonald vs. Thompson, the UFC released a tribute video for the one and only Kimbo Slice, who died in a Florida hospital at just 42 years old after suffering from heart failure. Slice was scheduled to compete in against James Thompson at Bellator 158 on July 16th prior to his shocking passing. Kimbo's time in the UFC was brief, but it was memorable and highly publicized. Following his loss to Seth Petruzelli in EliteXC, Kimbo (real name: Kevin Ferguson) signed on to become one of 16 heavyweights on season 10 of The Ultimate Fighter. The season premiere drew in an astonishing 4.1 million viewers. Slice would fight (and lose to) Roy Nelson in the 3rd episode, which averaged 5.3 million viewers, peaking at over 7 million with DVR viewership. Current TUF needs an entire season to reach 5 million viewers total. Despite the early exit, Kimbo was given a spot on the TUF 10 Finale card against Houston Alexander. Sure, this GIF is etched into the memories of everyone who watched the fight live, but we were treated to the Kimboplex, which you can see at the top of the video. The TUF 10 Finale averaged 3.7 million viewers and peaked at 5.2 million. Kimbo would appear on PPV at UFC 113 in May 2010, when he lost by TKO to fellow TUF 10 cast member Matt Mitrione. It was the last time Slice would compete in the UFC, and it was his last MMA fight until his Bellator debut in 2015. On a related programming note, before Bellator: Dynamite 2 on Friday, June 24th, Spike TV will air a one-hour special on Kimbo Slice at 7 PM ET/PT.",0

Regular doses of vitamin D3 may improve heart function in heart failure patients, a new British study suggests. ?These findings could make a significant difference to the care of heart failure patients,? said study leader Dr. Klaus Witte, from the University of Leeds School of Medicine. ?It is the first evidence that vitamin D3 can improve heart function of people with heart muscle weakness ? known as heart failure.? The study included more than 160 patients who had pacemakers and/or were receiving blood pressure drugs known as ACE inhibitors or beta blockers. The study participants took either vitamin D or inactive placebo pills once a day for a year. The researchers explained that they avoided using a calcium-based vitamin D supplement, because calcium can cause other problems for heart failure patients. Heart pumping function improved from 26 percent to 34 percent in patients who took vitamin D, while there was no change among those who took the placebo pills, the investigators found. The study was presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Chicago. Research presented at medical meetings is typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. The researchers suggested that the improvement seen in some of the patients who took vitamin D might reduce their need for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). An ICD is a device that detects dangerous heart rhythm problems and delivers a shock to restore a normal heartbeat. ?ICDs are expensive and involve an operation. If we can avoid an ICD implant in just a few patients, then that is a boost to patients and [health systems] as a whole,? Witte said in a university news release. Heart failure affects about 23 million people worldwide, the study authors said. More information The American Academy of Family Physicians has more about heart failure.",0

Typically users of mathematics seldom consider the philosophical implications of the formulae as indices of the actual underlying composition of reality. As an example of what I am referring to, the twin (but distinct formulae) E=MC^2 and E=hf have different uses and different units of measurement, etc. but they represent a manifestation of the underlying unified field that comprises our reality. The field manifestations we call energy/mass/momentum (depending upon the application they are used and measured in) are essentially equivalent, as Einstein revealed. Do you think we can draw any conclusions about the underlying composition of our reality from them? Quote: Originally Posted by mitchellmckain My reaction is to tell you I am not a logical positivist, whose program to divorce scientific language from metaphysical concepts was a failure. Metaphysics (the study of reality) is not something conducted by a scientific methodology and is therefore not science by the modern definition. However science cannot be isolated from the metaphysical and epistemological foundations upon which it was derived. This only goes to say that science does not and cannot hold itself up by its own bootstraps, not that either of these philosophical endeavors share in the accepted epistemological superiority of science. Nevertheless science requires such philosophical groundwork and generally relegates such efforts to a creative interlude given names like ""scientific visualization."" I understand your clarification of your position. It is encouraging. Quote: I guess I am straying a little from your question. So perhaps more to the point I should say this. While science is defined by a very restrictive methodology, philosophy is much less restrictive and religion has no general defined methodology at all. The result is not only considerably more diversity of opinion in philosophy and religion but also while religion (and philosophy for the most part as well) cannot inform science, the opposite is not the case. Science certainly can and does inform both philosophy and religion. I guess in summation I am saying yes to your question, it can BUT... this does not impart a scientific status to these philosophical and religious conclusions. Good. We agree. Quote: I don't know why you claim such a thing. This has certainly never applied to me and it seems to me that scientists do this quite frequently. WHAT IS TRUE, is that they know the difference between such speculations and proper science. Perhaps it was more strongly worded than I intended. My experience is they typically know the difference but have no interest or desire to even engage the speculations seeing no practical relevance in them. Although many simply see the artificial constructs as models of quantitative representations of processes and phenomena, NOT as indicators of any underlying composition of reality. Quote: Of course I do -- I mean... this is something that I do. But while many might see a unified field as the underlying reality, I think the evidence is greater for underlying reality to be something more of a geometrical nature. For example... 1. General relativity pretty much reduces gravitational fields to the geometry of space-time. 2. Kaluza and Klein showed that this can include Electromagnetism by simply extending GR to 5 dimensions. 3. String theory (M theory) reduces all the different particles (i.e. fields) to the vibrational modes strings and higher dimensional branes. The geometry of spacetime is fraught with complications that arise from the very nature of our thoughts and the quantum formation time that underpins our delayed experience of our ""instantaneous awareness"" that creates the phenomena of spacetime. We can touch on that later. It is true that multidimensional speculations provide the advantage of increasing degrees of freedom to represent reality, but I am a lover of a four-dimensional world or as Minkowski called it, ""Die vierdimenionsale velt."" Once we start speculating beyond those dimensions almost anything can be represented. String theory has the vibratory nature of reality down, but they create a virtual impossibility to ever empirically test their formulations. We can only really measure in four dimensions. Quote: Of course, there is always the possibility that what we have is two complementary representations of the same thing. This often implies that reality is other than what we visualize and the closest we can get is two different images which only partially capture the reality of the thing -- you know, like how photons, electrons and such are both particles and waves at the same time. Yes, they are complementary representations that reveal that our underlying reality is actually nothing more than vibratory manifestations of a field. This, along with quantum mechanics, seems to suggest that particles are simply events we measure and NOT actual material substance existing through time. This has unsettling implications for our macro experiences as well. It would seem even we are merely vibratory events existing as some manner of aggregate spherical standing waveforms whose ""permanence"" is illusory. I am pleased that we do seem to be on a similar wavelength, to egregiously punish a pun. Quote: P.S. E=MC^2 and E=hf do not in of themselves have different units, but any equation can used in different units if you so choose. The dimensions remain the same but the units or measuring yardsticks you use is arbitrary and can thus be altered. I agree, but that is ancillary to the point I wanted to make using them as indices of the composition of our reality.",0

It is a common experience which may indicate either a normal physiological response within the body or a serious medical condition requiring urgent attention. Most cases tend to be the result of normal physiological responses. Danger signs include frequent episodes and association with other symptoms such as loss of consciousness, visual blurring and headache. There are a number of Toronto dizziness treatment options one may benefit from. Dizziness should be differentiated form a similar feeling known as vertigo. Since the two have different causes and treatments, your doctor will seek to establish which of the two you suffer from. In vertigo, affected persons will complain that their surrounding is spinning. It is very similar to what one experiences just after they alight from a merry go round. The cause of vertigo is damage to inner ear structures. The doctor will also want to establish a number of characteristics of your illness which will provide clues as to the most likely cause. These include the factors that trigger the symptom, whether or not it has progressed over time and the severity. A physical examination involving all the body systems will then be conducted. A number of tests are vital to establishing the cause of your symptoms. They include radiological images such as the MRI and CT scan and blood tests such as the haemogram. Conditions that affect the cardiovascular system frequently cause lightheadedness. They include hypertension, hypotension, heart failure and problems of heart rhythm. Each condition has a specific treatment. Hypertension, for instance, is treated by lifelong antihypertensive drugs and lifestyle modification. Abnormal rhythm can be corrected by anti-arrhythmic drugs or fixation of artificial pacemakers. Heart failure requires long term treatment with anti-failure drugs. The other system that may cause this symptom is the central nervous system. There are a wide range of causes that fall under this category. They include both chronic and acute conditions such as strokes, severe headaches, migraines, brain tumors and dementia. Some of the conditions within this system may go undiagnosed for long periods of time and it is only after they are greatly advanced that they become obvious. Fluctuations in blood sugar levels is a possible cause of dizziness. This is a common problem among persons with diabetes. In such persons, the deficiency or loss of sensitivity of insulin makes it difficult for the body to maintain the levels within the normal limits. The problem is likely to be encountered among persons that fail to comply with their prescriptions. Taking your drugs as prescribed will help avoid the frequency of the episodes. There are numerous other causes of this condition. Other common causes include anemia and intake of some drugs such as tranquilizers and sedatives. If you take part in a strenuous physical activity (by running a marathon, for instance), dizziness may set in due to physiological changes. Ensure that you have adequate glucose and water to use in such a situation. The option of therapy that is chosen for the management of dizziness is greatly determined by the cause. When the underlying cause is identified and treated, the symptoms are likely to resolve or at least reduce in frequency and severity. The treatments that are used include avoiding trigger factors (in migraines, for example), using drugs and making some lifestyle changes.

BLOG,http://jeffmarx.blogspot.com,http://jeffmarx.blogspot.com/2016/06/forgiven-forgiving-matthew-18.html,6/17/2016,11:57:00,6/17/2016 21:27,Forgiven. Forgiving. Matthew 18,"Every time we pray the Lord's prayer, most of us say, ""Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us."" This, however, is not what Matthew 6:12 actually says. There we read ""Forgive us our debts as we have forgiven our debtors."" In Matthew 6:14-15 Jesus explains that if we forgive the trespasses of others, ours will be forgiven, but if we do not forgive the trespasses of others, then ours will not be forgiven. In Luke the word used is ""sins."" As Jesus probably did not speak in Greek, all of the New Testament is a translation of the Aramaic which He would have spoken; and in Jewish thought of His time debts, trespasses and sins were interchangeable concepts. Their meaning would overlap. I think that English does provide us some interesting depth though. Today's MP Gospel is from a section on forgiveness in Mt 18:15-35. It begins with how to confront those who have sinned and then goes on to say that when two or three gather in Jesus' Name He is with them. For many Christians, this is a very uncomfortable word from the Lord, because He says that the Church (humans) are an extension of God. In other words, there is no simple division between God and Man, as is so popular among many. Jesus says (in other places as well) that when we are in Him, our words and actions carry the Divine imprimatur and convey the power and authority of God. Jesus takes the church very, very seriously. Our reading today begins in verse 21, where Peter asks how many times must we forgive, ""seven times?"" This is a Biblical number and conveys the idea of generous mercy. However, Jesus ups the ante considerably (the Greek can be translated as seventy times seven [490] or seventy seven [77]). There is probably a reference here to Genesis 4:24 (""If Cain is avenged seven fold, truly Lamech seventy-seven fold"") and makes clear that we, as Jesus people, are in the mercy and forgiveness business. The Lord then illustrates the principle with a parable. A man is in debt, owing ten thousand talents. One talent is about six to ten thousand denarii. A denarii is a day's wage. So it is at least six thousand days wages or about seventeen years wages. Multiply that by ten thousand and you have many, many lifetimes of debt. It is totally unpayable, the equivalent of a billion dollars for us. So the man is to be sold into slavery and his family as well. However, after begging for mercy (and making the ridiculous promise to pay it back if given time) the man receives gracious kindness and the Master writes off the debt. Then, the same man bumps into someone who owes him one hundred days wages (just over three months). However, he ignores the pleas for mercy and imprisons his debtor. In the end, other servants distressed by his cruelty go to the Master and inform him of this turn of events. So the Master confronts the man and points out the mercy which he received, the lack of mercy he demonstrated and the punishment. He receives what he gave the other, prison... In English, the words sin and trespasses are negative. They refer to an act which transgresses. Debt, on the other hand, has a broader meaning. A debt is something owed. Sin focused western Christians can be so sin aware that we are at risk to overlook the blessings for which we are also indebted to God. We also have an unpayable debt of gratitude. Too often people view their minor sins as unworthy of a death sentence, even if God is perfect. It does not resonate that He cannot bear to be in the presence of flawed humanity. Perhaps, if that is how you think, it is easier to imagine God's problem with people who are so far in debt for blessings (as well as sins) not being grateful and graceful to others. Let's ponder. Every breath is a gift, hundreds of gifts each hour, day after day. If you don't believe it ask someone with COPD or asthma or lung disease. Every breath a gift, a debt. Each heart beat is a gift. Sending life sustaining blood throughout our bodies. hundreds of heart beats a day, day after day. If you don't believe ask someone unable to walk because of congestive heart failure or other heart disease. Every beat of your heart, a gift, a debt. Is seeing a blessing? Yes the debt of eyesight. Is hearing a blessing"" Yes, every sound a blessing, a debt. Is beauty around you a blessing? Yes, and each beautiful thing a blessing, a debt. What of love, acceptance, laughter, companionship --- every act of kindness we receive, any good thing which enriches us, each moment and every blessing, another debt. Food and drink, rest and sleep, painless moments and pleasures---each one, every second it lasts, a blessing, a wonderful gift, and another debt. Even if I were sinless and could stand before God in righteousness, my debt would remain unpayable, because all that I am and all that I have is a gift. Existence is a gift. Thinking and feeling and being all gifts. What is my debt? Millions of heart beats and breaths. Thousands of sunlit days and gentle breezes, glorious rains and sparkling stars. Hundreds of loved ones to share my life journey. Memories of days gone by, good days (and ask those whose memories are gone what a blessing memory is---more debts) Yes, I owe God billions and billions. Many blessings, blessings I take for granted, blessings which I assume I should have. Everything I have I owe to God. All things. And He writes it all off. Every debt. Every good thing He has done, and every bad thing I have done. Written off. Except, says Jesus... Except, as we pray... Except unforgiveness. Except the refusal to give mercy as we receive it. Except the rejection of His life in us. The one debt that must be paid by us is treating others with love and mercy. Unforgiveness cancels His gracious mercy. So says Jesus. We are all debtors, debtors beyond imagining. Treat others debtors as God the Father has treated you. Forgive them their debts. Forgive as you have been forgiven.",0

PAUL, Minn. & CHICAGO--(satPRNews.com)--St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE:STJ), a global medical device company, today announced new data from Northwell Health highlighting the center?s experience with the CardioMEMS? HF System. The study demonstrated that monitoring pulmonary artery pressure with the CardioMEMS technology leads to significant improvements in quality of life (as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ]) and ability to exercise (using the six minute walk [6MW] test standard) in patients with chronic heart failure. These data were presented at the American College of Cardiology 65th Annual Scientific Session. ?The data confirms that patients who are monitored using the CardioMEMS HF System are seeing significant improvements in the quality of their lives, including an increase in exercise capacity,? said Dr. Rita Jermyn, director, Congestive Heart Failure Program at North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, New York, part of Northwell Health. The analysis evaluated 66 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III heart failure; 34 underwent implant of the CardioMEMS device and 32 patients remained on medical management alone. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed based on the KCCQ that measures QoL items such as physical and social function, symptoms and self-efficacy. A 6MW test was conducted to evaluate exercise capacity for each patient. The study found management with the CardioMEMS device led to a: Decrease of nearly seven percent in body weight Three-fold increase in quality of life scoring Increase of 38 percent in the distance patients were able to walk within the 6MW test ?We are excited to see independent data from centers implanting the CardioMEMS device and are very pleased to see such great results from Northwell Health,? said Dr. Philip B. Adamson, medical director and vice president of medical affairs for St. Jude Medical. ?The study data confirm benefits originally observed in our landmark CHAMPION study, which show patients who are monitored with the CardioMEMS HF System have a reduction in hospitalizations and an improvement in their quality of life.? The CardioMEMS HF System uses a miniature wireless monitoring sensor implanted in the pulmonary artery to directly measure pulmonary artery pressure. Patients can transmit these data from home to their health care Providers, allowing providers to stabilize pressure by managing the patient?s medications more effectively. The CardioMEMS HF System is the first and only FDA-approved heart failure monitor that, when used by physicians, has been shown to significantly reduce heart failure hospital admissions and improve the quality of life in NYHA Class III patients. Long-term, prospective data published in The Lancet supports the effectiveness of the CardioMEMS HF System at reducing heart failure hospitalizations by demonstrating the system can provide physicians the opportunity to proactively manage their heart failure patients. The CHAMPION study originally demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant 28 percent reduction in the rate of heart failure hospitalizations at six months, and a 37 percent reduction in heart failure hospitalizations during an average follow-up duration of 15 months.

If you are the patient, these points will enable your feeling better. As the caregiver, you provide a knowledgeable, calming influence to bring the patient past this crisis. A little medical familiarity goes a long way when the condition looks dangerous. However, in more perilous situations, a few strategic steps can save the day until medical personnel arrive. METHOD 1 OF 2: DURING AN ACUTE BOUT Assess the situation. If this happens often, it may be chronic. Consider the health of the person at hand. Is this a result of sickness? Was anything unusual going on at the time that could have had a lowering effect on blood sugar levels? What?s more, stay relaxed. There may not be a bigger problem at hand. You will need to ascertain if the symptoms point to dangerously low blood pressure. Generally the symptoms include dizziness, lightheadedness, unsteadiness, dimming or blurring of vision, weakness, fatigue, nausea, cold, clammy skin, fainting, and pale skin. Insist the patient drink plenty of water or other fluids. When blood volume is increased and dehydration is alleviated, hypotension may disappear.[3] Sports drinks containing electrolytes return lost minerals to the body, too. Drinking these or water will keep dehydration from happening. Another way of spiking blood pressure (temporarily, that is) is to drink caffeine. Scientists aren?t quite sure how or why it does this, but it?s thought that it either blocks hormones that widen your arteries or pumps up your adrenaline levels, directly causing a rise in blood pressure. Provide something salty for the patient to eat. The excess salt helps to make blood pressure rise. That?s why heart patients are usually on low-sodium diets. Sodium is known to raise blood pressure (and sometimes greatly), so doctors generally recommend limiting it. Check with your healthcare professional before you up your intake ? if you consume an amount that?s not good for you, it can lead to heart failure (especially if you?re older). Think of circulation needs in relation to blood pressure . Raise the legs and put on compression stockings, if available. These are the same stockings that people use to reduce varicose veins and they?re just as good for reducing blood pooling up in the legs. Determine whether or not the patient has missed necessary medications. The problem could easily be failure to follow doctor?s orders. Many medications lower or heighten blood pressure, even if just as a side effect. Certain combinations can also be more powerful than when taken alone. Give any missed medications to the patient. Make sure they (or you as the case may be) understand the importance of not missing doses. Or not taking too much! In addition to their regular meds, know that acetaminophen (Tylenol) and certain anti-inflammatories and anti-depressants can also spike blood pressure levels. If you have some readily available, consider adding it in this instance. Pump your feet and dance around on your hands a few times before standing up. It?s common for even healthy individuals to experience a dip in blood pressure when they rise after long periods of sitting. When going to stand (especially upon getting out of bed), sit up straight first and rise slowly. If you?re able, get regular exercise to promote blood flow. If it?s a chronic issue, keep up the exercise and eat small meals often. METHOD 2 OF 2: FURTHER ACTION Contact the patient?s physician if the blood pressure reading was dangerously low. A medical professional?s advice will be invaluable during this situation. Thoroughly explain the circumstances of the lower blood pressure to the physician. If the patient can talk, have them describe the symptoms as vividly as possible. Do exactly what the physician suggests. In cases of dangerously low blood pressure, the physician may want the patient to go to the emergency room. Take blood pressure readings, if possible, when the crisis is over. If it?s still too low, you may need to seek further medical attention. Slightly below 120/80 is considered ideal.

OMG!!! dat wist ik allemaal niet ... !!!!! Een beetje tegenwind pro ei Citaat: http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/eggs/ Long vilified by well-meaning doctors and scientists for their high cholesterol content, eggs are now making a bit of a comeback. While it?s true that egg yolks have a lot of cholesterol?and so may weakly affect blood cholesterol levels?eggs also contain nutrients that may help lower the risk for heart disease, including protein, vitamins B12 and D, riboflavin, and folate. A solid body of research shows that for most people, cholesterol in food has a much smaller effect on blood levels of total cholesterol and harmful LDL cholesterol than does the mix of fats in the diet. Recent research has shown that moderate egg consumption?up to one a day?does not increase heart disease risk in healthy individuals (1, 2) and can be part of a healthy diet. (Make sure to store eggs in the fridge and cook them until the whites and yolks are firm, to prevent food-borne illness. For more tips on how to reduce your risk of salmonella from eggs, visit the Center for Disease Control and Prevention?s website.) People who have difficulty controlling their total and LDL cholesterol may want to be cautious about eating egg yolks and instead choose foods made with egg whites. The same is true for people with diabetes. In the Nurses? Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, heart disease risk was increased among men and women with diabetes who ate one or more eggs a day. (1) For people who have diabetes and heart disease, it is best to limit egg consumption to no more than three yolks per week. This research doesn?t give the green light to daily three-egg omelets. While a 2008 report from the ongoing Physicians? Health Study supports the idea that eating an egg a day is generally safe for the heart, it also suggests that going much beyond that could increase the risk for heart failure later in life. (3) You also need to pay attention to the ?trimmings? that come with your eggs. To your cardiovascular system, scrambled eggs, salsa, and a whole wheat English muffin are a far different meal than scrambled eggs with cheese, sausages, home fries, and white toast.",0

BLOG,houseandhome.org,http://www.houseandhome.org/heart-attack/,7/30/2016,12:50:26,,,"Heart attack (also known as a cardiac infarct, coronary occlusion, coronary thrombosis or acute myocardial infarction) is the most serious form of heart disease. It is common for persons suddenly affected to drop dead during their normal activities. It is essential that you be aware of the symptoms of a sudden heart attack. Today, modern treatment is very effective. The sooner this is started, the greater are the chances of complete recovery. The symptoms of a heart attack are well-established. The underlying causes of heart disease have been well-documented, and the ways of reducing a heart attack are clear-cut and well-established. Much research has given many answers. Sensible people will follow the straightforward recommendations offered. These are set out at the end of this section. It is essential to recognize and provide emergency first aid treatment for a possible heart attack. Heart Attack Symptoms Here are the key heart attack symptoms as set out by the National Heart Foundation: A prolonged oppressive pain or unusual discomfort in the centre of the chest, behind the breastbone. The pain may radiate to the shoulder, arm, neck, or jaw. Often the pain or discomfort is accompanied by sweating. Nausea, vomiting and shortness of breath may occur. Sometimes the symptoms subside then recur. Never forget: A chest pain that does not go away after 15 ? 20 minutes of rest should never be ignored. It could be a heart attack. What to Do in the Case of a Heart Attack ? Take Immediate Action Make patient comfortable. If conscious, sit the person up. Allay anxiety. Speak encouraging words. Call ambulance. If possible, suggest it may be a heart attack, and a special coronary-care ambulance may be available. If patient collapses, breathing stops or heart stops, expired air resuscitation and external cardiac compression must be started. If no assistance is available, get the patient to the nearest hospital as urgently as possible. Time may mean a life saved. The quicker the patient receives expert attention the more likely are the chances of survival and complete recovery. They reduce with the passage of time and no help. Do not be embarrassed about seeking help. It is better to be wrong than make an error of judgment. Keep calm. Do not panic. A life could depend on your prompt, efficient, calm manner. The symptoms of an infarction are extremely variable, according to the size of the infarct. Some are major, and can produce sudden death. But the majority are smaller, and produce a varying range of symptoms. Attacks are not necessarily related to exercise (as angina is). Indeed, attacks may come on while at rest or even during sleep. However, usually symptoms and signs are fairly typical, and allow a doctor to make a prompt diagnosis. Indeed, a person affected can often form an accurate diagnosis. An important rule of thumb is that it is better to inaccurately self-diagnose a heart attack than miss it. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment may be lifesaving. No age group is immune from cardiac infarcts. However, they are far more common in males aged 40 ? 70 years. Males outnumber females by 4 to 1. It seems that increasing numbers of younger males are being afflicted with ?coronaries.? This may be related to the added stresses of modern living (although others deny this), the high level of living (with an increase in fat content of food there is a greater cholesterol intake), and other factors. In recent years, the importance of smoking as a cause of heart disease has become recognized. It is now well documented as a leading cause of this disability. Although the heart may have suffered relatively minor muscle damage, the chances of severe (and usually fatal) change in heart rhythm are about 25 times greater during the first four hours than during the next 24. Many heart-attack patients believe they have ?indigestion,? ?colic,? ?dyspepsia,? or some other trivial stomach upset. Many feel embarrassed to make a fuss or summon assistance, fearing they are wrong in their beliefs. Others deliberately neglect to call help, fearing the worst, but hoping their inner fears may be wrong. Each year more than 910000 Americans die from heart attacks and diseases of the cardiovascular system (i.e. heart and blood vessel systems). Prompt, expert treatment can radically reduce a disastrous outcome. Indeed, it is believed that with proper attention, 75 per cent of heart-attack patients recover, and can return to a near-normal life again. Heart Attack Treatment A heart attack is a medical emergency. If a person has any of the symptoms enumerated, it is imperative to obtain immediate expert medical assistance. There is no place for home remedies in these cases, apart from allaying the anxiety of the patient and making him or her feel more comfortable. Taking an aspirin can help. While awaiting this attention, if sudden collapse occurs, and the heart stops beating, expired-air resuscitation and external cardiac compression will help maintain breathing and circulation. If you have had some basic training in this field, it is worth commencing, and may be lifesaving. Call an ambulance at once, and briefly explain the nature of the symptoms. If the ambulance is not available, get the patient to the nearest hospital as a matter of urgency. Special mobile intensive-care ambulances fitted to meet cardiac emergencies and equipped with highly trained teams (called ?paramedic units?) are now available in most capital cities in Australia and New Zealand. They can often be at the patient?s side within a few minutes and so can initiate lifesaving treatment within only a few moments. Immediately emergency care has been administered, the patient is then transported to the special coronary care ward (or intensive care unit) of a major hospital. Here highly skilled and very specialized treatment with constant supervision is available. The patient is usually attached to a constant electrocardiograph machine and a screen reveals a continuous picture of the heart?s action. The relevant tests that are needed are carried out quickly. Treatment is maintained at a high level of efficiency. A prompt and accurate diagnosis is made. Modern tests that seek certain chemicals called enzymes in the blood assist the experts in pinpointing an accurate diagnosis. These are called ?cardiac enzymes.? Their presence can tell the extent of the heart attack. Subsequent serial tests indicate the progress of the patient. Death from a ?coronary? is usually due to the failure of the heart to continue pumping adequately, or to a breakdown in the nervous control of the heart, which leads to a serious condition called ventricular fibrillation. Newer drugs that assist in bringing this condition back to normal are now being used. The drug lignocaine (Xylocaine) assists in reinstating a normal heartbeat. A large family of medications called the beta-blockers can also assist in gross heartbeat irregularities. A machine called a defibrillator can also help re-establish normal heartbeat activity. Pain-relieving preparations (such as morphine), oxygen, sedation and the medications that have stood the test of time are still widely used for infarcts. Reassurances and supportive measures are as important today as in earlier days when facilities for emergency treatment were far less sophisticated than they are now. Act promptly. Studies have shown that it takes the average heart attack victim three hours to do anything about his symptoms. The average time-lapse between the onset of warning symptoms and hospital admission is eight hours. The first four hours are of paramount importance. The earlier a heart attack patient can be admitted to hospital and get expert attention, the greater are the chances of survival. There are many general measures that the anginal patient can carry out, and which may effectively assist in keeping symptoms at a minimum level. Avoiding the known precipitating factors will help immeasurably. The patient should make an effort to avoid undue exercise that is known to produce symptoms. Similarly, social and environmental predisposing factors must be avoided. It is best to avoid circumstances where emotional crises and flaring tempers are involved, for this will only breed more and greater problems if allowed to persist. It would be best if the patient could adopt a philosophical attitude to life in general, accept the position and make the most of the remaining years of life. Meals of moderate size and easily digestible food, preferably low fat in content and free from fried foods, are best. If there is obvious overweight, sticking to a 4200 kJ (1000-calorie)-a-day diet for a while will help lower the weight and so diminish the risk factors. Regular sleep often assists. Eight hours a night is preferable. Sometimes, with carp- onset of the symptoms, a period of bed rest may be advisable. Gearing life to meet one?s ability at coping is essential. The same applies to work, with due retard to the social and economic circumstances of the individual.

If you let us know what part of the world you are in, members may be able to advise on the best way of getting your d admitted to a hospital. Extreme reluctance and refusal of medical care is a common symptom of this terrible illness, and different people have managed it in different ways, from getting large strong relatives to sit in the back seat on the way to the hospital, to getting medical guardianship. It also helps to know what you'll encounter when you get to the hospital. Complications from an extremely low BMI like your d's can include damage to the structure and function of the heart; increased risk of heart failure and death; reduction of bone density resulting in brittle bones and breakage; muscle loss and weakness; severe dehydration which can result in kidney failure; edema (swelling), and a whole host of other terrible things that you probably know already, including heightened risk of suicide. I cannot see that treating a symptom at home would in any way be beneficial (even if it were possible). It would in fact just prolong the time she goes without help getting what she really needs, which is nutrition, likely in a hospital. Her refusal to get treatment is a symptom of the illness. It's possible to get her in to treatment anyway. Many here have managed it. this forum, and the support and information I found here, helped save my daughter's life. While my daughter was younger when ed struck, please know that I like everyone here, know how hard and how confusing and terrifying dealing with ed is, but that there is hope, for treatment and for recovery. best wishes,",0

(click for credit) In a 2003 speech, John Kerry complained about the Bush administration, saying: Nothing illustrates this administration?s anti-science attitude better than George Bush?s cynical decision to limit research on embryonic stem cells. During the heat of the ?stem cell wars,? this was a common refrain. Life-saving treatments could be produced with embryonic stem cells, and anyone who questioned whether or not it was morally acceptable to destroy one life in order to experiment with saving another was ?anti-science.? Never mind that there are stem cells in everyone?s body, commonly called adult stem cells, and those stem cells also have the potential to cure illnesses. Everyone ?knew? that using embryonic stem cells would be better. What?s the difference between embryonic stem cells and adult stems cells? Well, most of the cells in your body have specific tasks. Your skin cells perform one set of tasks, while your muscle cells perform another set of tasks, your liver cells another set of tasks, etc., etc. These cells have all ?specialized? so they can perform their tasks efficiently. A stem cell, by contrast, is a cell that hasn?t yet ?specialized.? It can develop into many different cells, depending on your body?s needs. Embryonic stem cells end up developing into all the cells that make up the body, so they are thought to be very, very flexible when it comes to what they can develop into. However, to get those stem cells, you have to kill the embryo. Adult stem cells, on the other hand have already specialized to some degree. For example, the drawing at the top of this post shows how an adult stem cell found in bone marrow can develop into various different blood cells. While that shows some serious flexibility, bone marrow stem cells don?t normally develop into wildly different cells, like skin cells. As a result, it is thought that adult stem cells aren?t as flexible as embryonic stem cells. On the positive side, however, you don?t have to kill anything to get adult stem cells. The scientific question, then, boils down to this: ?Is it worth working with stem cells that might not be as flexible as embryonic stem cells in order to avoid killing human embryos?? Those who answered that question with a ?yes? have been routinely labelled ?anti-science.? However, now that we are 13 years past Mr. Kerry?s speech, we can see that adult stem cells have, in fact, demonstrated success in treating a wide variety of illnesses. Obviously, a lot more research has to be done, and none of these treatments are standard or routine yet. Nevertheless, it is now clear that if there is a limit to the abilities of adult stem cells when it comes to treating illnesses, we haven?t reached it yet. That brings me to the reason I am writing this article. Over the past few days, I have seen two more examples of adult stem cells successfully treating illnesses. The first example appears in JAMA Neurology, a specialized publication of the Journal of the American Medical Association. This study dealt with the treatment of myasthenia gravis, a degenerative neuromuscular disorder that can be life-threatening. The authors of the study followed 7 patients that were treated with stem cells from their own bone marrow, and all of them achieved stable remission and were freed from ongoing myasthenia gravis therapy!1 Now, of course, this is a small study, and while some patients were followed for 13 years, others were followed for only 2.5 years. In addition, the authors note that specialized patient care is necessary for this treatment to be effective. As a result, they only recommend it for institutions that have experience treating patients with myasthenia gravis. Nevertheless, it at least shows the potential of using a patient?s own adult stem cells to treat a neuromuscular disorder. The other study isn?t as groundbreaking, but it does provide new insights into the use of adult stem cells to treat heart failure. The authors reported on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of end-stage patients with serious heart failure. The only hope such patients have is for a heart transplant. Since that wasn?t possible for these patients, they agreed to be part of a study that examined the efficacy of treating their heart failure with (once again) stem cells from their own bone marrow. The procedure typically took only two hours, and most patients were released from the hospital the day after the procedure was done. After 12 months, those who received the treatment were 37% less likely to have been taken to a hospital and 50% less likely to die than those who received a placebo.2 While those numbers aren?t as wonderful as the numbers in the myasthenia gravis study, they are significant. In addition, the study was the largest ever done on this kind of treatment. Thus, it clearly shows that patients who need a heart transplant have at least one other option, thanks to adult stem cells. Far from being anti-science, then, caution about using embryonic stem cells is scientifically reasonable. Adult stem cells have shown quite a lot of promise, and they avoid the moral problems associated with killing embryos. REFERENCES 1.

Respiratory Disease Respiratory Disease is defined as medical conditions, affecting the breathing organ and tissues including Inflammatory lung disease, Obstructive lung diseases, Restrictive lung diseases, Respiratory tract infections, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli, the nerves and muscles breathing , etc,. Pleural disease: Pleural effusion The pleura is a thin tissue covered by a layer of cells (mesothelial cells) that surrounds the lungs and lines the inside of the chest wall. Pleural effusion is a condition of collection of fluid within the pleural cavity as a result of heart failure, bleeding (hemothorax), infections, excessive or decreased fluid volume, etc. The Misdiagnosis 1. Giant bronchogenic cyst There is a report of a case of giant pulmonary bronchogenic cyst (18 cm ? 15 cm ? 10 cm) misdiagnosed with loculated pleural effusion. Later Histopathology studies revealed a giant bronchogenic cyst with abscess formation(49). 2. Amoebic liver abscess There is a report of a 3 year old who had amoebic liver abscess but was wrongly diagnosed and treated for lobar Pneumonia with pleural effusion(50). 3. Extrapleural empyema there is a report of 49-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and alcoholic liver cirrhosis presented with dyspnoea and fever. A chest computed tomography scan revealed three areas of loculated pleural effusion. Initially, the patient was thought to have an intrapleural empyema and during open drainage, the patient was diagnosed to have an extrapleural empyema(51). 4. False positive for malignancy there is a report of a 23-year-old female with systemic lupus erythematosus is reported. The clinical features included fever, shortness of breath, lymphadenopathies, hepatosplenomegaly, pleural and pericardial fluids, ANA and Anti-DNA positivity. Pleural biopsy was false positive for malignancy on two occasions. High CA125 levels were detected in both serum and pleural fluid. Following prednisolone treatment, clinical and laboratory findings returned to normal(52). Other study report of a case of a patient with traumatic hemothorax, showing high pleural fluid concentrations of ferritin, tissue polypeptide antigen, and cancer antigen 125. This patient?s pleural fluid also contained high levels of bilirubin and many macrophages containing phagocytized red blood cells, suggesting a local metabolism of hemoglobin. Our case confirms that some tumoral markers can give false positive results and suggests that their significance must be evaluated differently in bloody pleural effusions as compared with non-bloody pleural effusions(53). 5. Boerhaave?s Syndrome There is a report of a case of an atypical presentation of Boerhaave?s Syndrome in an elderly female who presented to the Emergency Department with dyspnea, right sided chest pain, right pleural effusion, and hypovolemic shock without an identifiable antecedent event. A chest radiograph revealed massive right hydropneumothorax. After placement of a chest tube, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Only 36 hours after admission did the diagnosis of Boerhaave?s Syndrome become evident(54).

Each day we will walk (and maybe even run) over 30 miles. On Day 1 we will begin at Brighton Pier and follow the coast as much as we can stopping for the night at Bexhill On Sea. On Day 2 we will make our way from East Sussex back to our home county of Kent resting for the night at Dymchurch. The final day will be our longest stretch at over 33 miles. Walking through much more familiar surroundings we will finish on Monday evening at Broadstairs Pier!!! We are so excited to work together to raise as much money as we can for our chosen charities as well as putting ourselves to the test. We really appreciate your support and know that any donations received will make a difference to each of the charities! Thanks... and wish us luck! :-/ xxx Kent MS Therapy Centre The aim of the Kent MS Therapy Centre is to improve the quality of life for people with Multiple Sclerosis, their families and those who care for them. Being diagnosed with MS can be a very demoralising experience and many people turn to the Centre for support. The Centre provides advice, information and practical therapies such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, hydrotherapy, physiotherapy, counselling, body massage and reflexology to name a few. Specialist clinics and symptom management workshops are also held on a regular basis. Opened in 1985 the Centre offers a warm and caring environment for people of all ages and their relatives and friends. It is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions, with MS patients themselves making a small contribution towards their therapies. The Centre is completely self suporting and receives no support from the Government or NHS whatsoever despite its obvious key role in the community. Welcome to Pilgrims HospicesPilgrims Hospices is a charity providing specialist palliative care free of charge to people in east Kent. We care for people with illnesses that can not be cured including cancer, heart failure, respiratory conditions and neurological diseases. Care is provided from the three sites in Canterbury, Ashford and Thanet, in patients homes and via community programmes. Support is also extended to families and carers. To keep delivering care to those that need it the most. Pilgrims has to raise ?11 million each year from our local community, so fundraising is very important. Jo?s Cervical Cancer Trust Nearly 3 women a day will die from cervical cancer whilst each year around 2,800 women are newly diagnosed, facing an uncertain future. In addition, some 300,000 women a year are told they may have a cervical abnormality that might require treatment. Jo?s Cervical Cancer Trust is the UK?s only charity dedicated to women, their families and friends affected by cervical abnormalities and cervical cancer. It was established by James Maxwell following the death of his wife, Jo (aged 40) from cervical cancer in 1999. We exist to ensure women never feel alone at all stages of their journey by providing a range online and face to face support 24 hours a day including: 1. Enabling women to meet online, to share experiences and support others facing similar challenges 2. Proving opportunities for women, friends and families to meet face to face for shared support 3. Providing information about cervical cancer and abnormalities written and reviewed by experts 4. Enabling individuals to send a medical question to our online panel of medical experts 5. Campaigning to influence UK Governments to implement new and improved preventative, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures 6. Running a range of programmes to educate the public and health professionals on key areas relating to cervical cancer and how it can be prevented.",0

A friend discovered that she had a hard time absorbing vit. D and her doctor asked her to take vitamin K, her D levers improved after that. I'm the first PP who recommended Dr. Soram's book. I'd add to this person's comment about Vitamin K... Vitamin K is critical. You should know that you can put your body in danger by supplementing with a high dose of Vitamin D + calcium supplements, if you're not supplementing with Vitamin K. High doses of vitamin D makes your body very absorbent of calcium. That's fine, if you're getting your calcium from food, but taking a pharmaceutical grade dose of calcium can cause calcifications near your heart, which can make you more susceptible to heart failure down the road. Vitamin K acts as a vehicle to get the calcium to where it needs to be (your bones and teeth, away from your heart!). Taking a high dose of vitamin D + a high dose of calcium could be deadly, actually. Personally, I take 6000 IUs of Vitamin D3 (targeting a serum level of 60-70) + 100 mcg of Vitamin K2 + krill oil each day. I get all my calcium from food (I eat a lot of kale and some cheese). I take no other vitamins other than the ones I've listed. Supplementation can really strengthen your health, but beware of exactly what you're doing - there's a lot of research saying that supplementation of certain vitamins (even water soluble vitamins like Vitamin C can increase the risk, by a lot, of certain cancers). As a healthy adult (knock on wood!), I don't think I'll ever take a multivitamin.",0

But new research suggests many of these studies are flawed and that such benefits may be largely overestimated. The researchers say we should be skeptical of studies reporting the health benefits of moderate drinking. Lead researcher Tim Stockwell, PhD, of the Centre for Addictions Research at the University of Victoria, Canada, and colleagues reached their conclusion by analyzing 87 studies that assessed the effects of moderate drinking on longevity. They recently published their findings in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs . According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), over the past month, around 24.6% of adults report engaging in binge drinking and around 6.8% report engaging in heavy drinking. Such drinking habits can increase the risk of alcohol use disorders, which affect around 16.6 million adults and 697,000 adolescents in the US. On the other hand, numerous studies have suggested that, in moderation, alcohol may be good for us. A recent study reported by Medical News Today , for example, suggested moderate drinking - defined in the study as three to five alcoholic beverages a week - may lower the risk of heart attack and heart failure . However, the new research from Stockwell and colleagues suggests the results of such studies should not be taken at face value, after finding that many of them are subject to biases that, when accounted for, eliminate the reported health benefits of moderate drinking. 'There are many reasons to be skeptical' From analyzing 87 studies that looked at the effects of alcohol consumption on death from all causes, the team identified a number of flaws in the way the studies were designed. One major issue they found was how the studies defined ""abstainers"" - people who do not drink alcohol. The researchers explain that many of the studies compared moderate drinkers - which they define as individuals who consume up to two alcoholic beverages daily - with ""current"" abstainers, but these abstainers may include individuals of poor health who have stopped drinking. ""A fundamental question is, who are these moderate drinkers being compared against?,"" says Stockwell. In their analysis, the researchers found that only 13 of the studies they assessed avoided biases in the abstainer group, and these studies demonstrated no mortality benefits with moderate drinking. Furthermore, when the researchers accounted for this bias and other flaws they identified related to study design, they found that moderate drinkers no longer showed any mortality benefits. Additionally, the researchers found that it was ""occasional"" drinkers - defined as individuals who consume less than one alcoholic beverage a week - who had the longest lifespan, and the team says it is unlikely that alcohol is the reason for this. ""Those people would be getting a biologically insignificant dose of alcohol,"" notes Stockwell. The team points out that the research did not investigate how specific types of alcohol - such as red wine, largely hailed for its health benefits when consumed in moderation - was associated with longevity, but Stockwell says it is doubtful any health benefits would be down to the alcohol itself. Overall, the team believes their results suggest studies hailing the health benefits of moderate drinking should be viewed with caution. Stockwell says: ""There's a general idea out there that alcohol is good for us, because that's what you hear reported all the time. But there are many reasons to be skeptical.""",0

The new drugs promised to reduce artery-clogging cholesterol by nearly twice as much as older ones. But they came at an eye-popping price: more than $14,000 per year, compared with roughly $150 for the standard drugs. Some experts predicted a doomsday scenario in which the two injectable drugs, Repatha and Praluent, would add a staggering $100 billion to the U.S. drug bill as doctors signed up millions of patients with elevated cholesterol. But then something unexpected happened: not much. Caught between skeptical doctors and cost-conscious insurers, the drugs have barely sold. Sanofi reported a meager $10 million from Praluent in the last quarter, which it co-markets with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Amgen Inc. declined to break out Repatha sales. Spending on pricey specialty drugs has doubled over the last five years to $150 billion, contributing 70 percent of the growth in U.S. medication spending since 2010, according to IMS Health. But the startlingly slow launch of Praluent and Repatha suggests insurers may have found their own formula for fighting back: proof-of-effectiveness requirements and rigorous paperwork that limits how many patients ultimately receive high-cost drugs. Experts see an escalating feud between drugmakers and insurers with little relief in sight. Advertisement ""The companies think that their drug is going to save a lot of lives and payers tend to be skeptical of those claims ? somewhere in the middle is the truth"" says Professor Darius Lakdawalla of the University of Southern California. Generally speaking, insurers only cover the costs of the new drugs for patients with extremely-high cholesterol caused by genetic disorders, or those with a history of heart problems and elevated cholesterol. The insurance paperwork can run several pages and often requires a detailed history of past treatments. Caught in the middle of the coverage fight are patients who say they desperately need more options to control bad cholesterol, or LDL. Christian Jacobs, 24, takes eight medications to manage his cholesterol and related complications, including blood thinners for the seven artery-opening stents he's received since 2011. He has a rare form of inheritable cholesterol that occurs in roughly one in a million people. So he was shocked when his insurance provider, UnitedHealth, rejected his doctors' prescription for Repatha. ""I was floored,"" he said. ""How in the world can we be rejected for a medication that I meet every single standard for?"" Jacobs said UnitedHealth recommended he continue his current drug regimen to see if it lowers his cholesterol. He is appealing the decision. UnitedHealth, which declined to comment on Jacobs' situation due to patient privacy laws, said in a statement it uses ""clinical guidelines and scientific evidence"" when making coverage decisions. ""These new therapies offer additional LDL cholesterol lowering and outcomes studies are still pending,"" said the firm. Recent medical history is littered with once-promising drugs that lowered test results like cholesterol, yet failed to actually help patients. Considering the high prices and limited data, many doctors favor a ""go slow"" approach. ""If you're going to spend that kind of money on a medication then you need to know that it's really doing something,"" said Dr. Hal Chadow of Brookdale University Hospital. Chadow has successfully prescribed the drugs to several high-risk patients, but he wants to see more research before using them more broadly. Some of the nation's top cardiologists predict the drugs will eventually reduce heart attack rates far below levels currently seen with statin pills, the standard-of-care for high cholesterol since the 1990s. But studies confirming those benefits are still months away, a key reason insurers demand extensive documentation before reimbursing the drugs. ""I really think it's a disservice to the public health to put people in charge of this who are essentially bean counters,"" said Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic. The medical center has assigned an expert to coach doctors on completing the insurance paperwork. Industry figures suggest a high bar: 90 percent of claims for Repatha and Praluent were initially rejected in the last quarter of 2015, according Symphony Health, a firm that analyzes insurance data. The companies doing the rejecting say they are merely following prescribing instructions on the medicines, which are approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Dr. Steve Miller of Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy benefit manager, says the company is approving more claims as doctors get better at picking ""the right patients and making sure they have adequate supporting data."" Wall Street continues to bet that the drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, will become blockbusters ? eventually. While many have slashed short-term estimates, most analysts predict that Repatha and Praluent will generate combined annual sales of over $5 billion by 2020, according to polling by Evaluate Pharma. Drugs that generate $1 billion or more annually are considered blockbusters. The analyst projections depend on one key assumption: that follow-up studies show the drugs reduce heart attacks and death. Amgen is expected to unveil data from its pivotal study later this year, with a similar study from Sanofi next year. But even assuming those studies pan out, some experts say the drugs ? which are self-injected once or twice a month, depending on the medication and indication ? are still overpriced. One analysis concluded that PCSK9 drugs represent a ""low"" value for patients and said a fairer price would be roughly half the list price, or between $5,000 and $8,000 per year, according to the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review. Sanofi and Amgen each criticized the group's analysis, disagreeing with its methods and conclusions. The Boston nonprofit receives funding from foundations, insurers, drugmakers and academic institutions. Dr. Steven Pearson, the group's president, says new approaches are needed for pricing medicines based on performance. He points to another pricey drug launched last summer: Novartis' heart failure drug, Entresto, has been shown to reduce hospitalizations and death more than older drugs. But its $4,600 annual price has slowed uptake. Novartis has signed unusual ""pay-for-performance"" contracts with several insurers, offering partial refunds if the drug fails to deliver better outcomes. Pearson's group gave the drug positive marks in an evaluation last year: ""We came out saying: good evidence on clinical effectiveness and good value."" In November, Amgen announced a similar agreement with Harvard's Pilgrim Health Care system. If Repatha doesn't lower patients' cholesterol to levels seen in company trials, Harvard Pilgrim gets a rebate. That approach is already used in Europe and could become more common here.

Ideally, you want to maintain a vitamin D level of 40 to 60 ng/ml year-round. Based on mounting research, 40 ng/ml appears to be the ?magic? number at which a whole host of health benefits are reaped. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to a variety of illnesses,1 including heart disease, stroke, hypertension, autoimmune diseases, type 1 and type 2 diabetes,rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn?s disease, multiple sclerosis, cognitive decline, Alzheimer?s disease, infectious diseases, and several deadly cancers. This includes cancers of the breast, colon, prostate, ovaries, esophagus, lymphatic system, and even melanoma. Vitamin D Lowers Overall Mortality Risk It?s no surprise then that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) reports an association between vitamin D and overall mortality risk.2 In one 54-month long study3 involving more than 422,800 healthy adults, those who were most deficient in vitamin D had an 88 percent increased risk of death from any cause. This is the kind of benefit I?m talking about when I say it would be wise to temper fears of melanoma?the deadliest form of skin cancer?and weigh that risk against other benefits, such as a significantly reduced risk of death from any disease. Moreover, by adhering to sensible sun exposure guidelines and making sure you do not get burned, you can maximize your benefits and minimize the risks of skin damage that could lead to skin cancer. On the whole, overexposure, not avoiding all sun exposure, is the real problem when it comes to raising your risk for skin cancer.4 Please Read This Important FTC Article! In a highly controversial action last week, the FTC had me stop selling our UV light systems which they classified as tanning beds but I was providing as a far more effective option for vitamin D to the hundreds of millions of people who don?t have access to enough sunshine. The legal battles with the FTC lasted a few years and required me to travel to Washington DC to meet with the FTC attorneys to work through these issues. I finally chose the lesser of all the evil options that were available to me. If you have not yet read my detailed rebuttal to the FTC?s action against me please do so now and let me know what you think about this important health freedom threat. I really am interested in hearing what your thoughts are on this important issue. Your input on this means a lot to me, Thanks for taking the time to respond. Higher Vitamin D = Lower Cancer Risk Previous research found that a vitamin D level of 50 ng/ml was associated with a 50 percent lower risk of breast cancer.5 Breast cancer patients with an average vitamin D level of 30 ng/ml were also twice as likely to survive compared to women with low levels (average 17 ng/ml). 6 Most recently, researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine report that raising your serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) to 40ng/ml can slash your risk of all invasive cancers by 67 percent..7,8,9 According to study co-author Cedric Garland, Dr.P.H.: 10 ?We have quantitated the ability of adequate amounts of vitamin D to prevent all types of invasive cancer combined, which had been terra incognita until publication of this paper? These findings support an inverse association between 25(OH)D and risk of cancer, and highlight the importance for cancer prevention of achieving a vitamin D blood serum concentration above 20 ng/ml, the concentration recommended by the IOM for bone health.? Improving Vitamin D Status is a Key Cancer Prevention Tool By pooling data from two previous studies?one randomized trial and one cohort study; the former of which showed a 77 percent lower cancer risk for women with a vitamin D level of 40 ng/ml compared to a baseline of 28 ng/ml11?they were able to get a much larger sample size with a broader range of vitamin D levels. This allowed them to more accurately determine the ideal vitamin D level for cancer prevention. The study included ALL invasive cancers, with the exception of skin cancer, and had a follow-up period of nearly four years. As reported by Science Daily:12 ?In the Lappe trial cohort, the median blood serum level of 25(OH)D was 30 nanograms per milliliter. In the GrassrootsHealth prospective cohort, it was higher: 48 ng/ml. The researchers found that the age-adjusted cancer incidence was 1,020 cases per 100,000 person-years in the Lappe cohort and 722 per 100,000 person-years in the GrassrootsHealth cohort. Cancer incidence declined with increased 25(OH)D. Women with 25(OH)D concentrations of 40 ng/ml or greater had a 67 percent lower risk of cancer than women with levels of 20 ng/ml or less... Primary prevention of cancer, rather than expanding early detection or improving treatment, will be essential to reversing the current upward trend of cancer incidence worldwide,? the researchers wrote. ?This analysis suggests that improving vitamin D status is a key prevention tool.? Research Needs to Be Translated Into Public Health Policy In a Creighton University press release, co-author Robert Heaney, M.D. highlighted the importance of sensible sun exposure for vitamin D optimization, and the need to modify public health policy with regards to sun exposure. As noted in the press release:13 ?Be sure you?re getting as much vitamin D as nature would give you under natural circumstances and you were wandering around outdoors exposing a lot of skin in the summer,? Heaney said. He refers to a study in which vitamin D levels were analyzed for native tribes in East Africa. They received nearly 10,000 international units per day of vitamin D and had lower cancer risk. In 2010, the Institute of Medicine recommended a vitamin D dosage of 600 international units per day. That?s not enough, says Heaney. But what is enough? For Heaney, he believes people should first discover how much vitamin D is in their blood levels? ?This is your blood level right now. You know how much you?re taking; if you want it higher, increase your dose. So then everybody is in control of their own vitamin D, nutritional status that way, instead of having to be dependent on lab tests and physicians,? Heaney said. Drawing on results from his study, Heaney believes vitamin D needs to be widely discussed. ?We have got to find a way to translate [these studies] into? public health policy,? Heaney said.? At the end of January 2016, President Obama established the ?Cancer Moonshot Task Force,? with the aim of creating a comprehensive plan to ?enable progress in treatment and care? of cancer.14 Optimizing vitamin D is one of the foundational recommendations that really need to be part of that plan, yet it?s not?at least not yet. How Does Vitamin D Help Protect Against Cancer? Vitamin D influences virtually every cell in your body, and is absolutely crucial to radically reduce your risk of cancer. Your organs can convert the vitamin D in your bloodstream into calcitriol, which is the hormonal or activated version of vitamin D. Your organs then use it to repair damage, including that from cancer cells. Vitamin D also triggers apoptosis (cell death) in cancer cells. According to Dr. Garland, in nearly all forms of breast cancer, vitamin D affects the structure of your epithelial cells. These cells are held together by a glue-like substance called E-cadherin, which provides structure to the cell. E-cadherin is made up of mostly vitamin D and calcium. If you don?t have adequate vitamin D, that structure comes apart and those cells do what they are programmed to do in order to survive ? they go forth and multiply. If this cell proliferation gets out of control, you may end up with cancer. If you have breast cancer in progress, the addition of vitamin D can help stop cancer cells in their tracks by replenishing E-cadherin. Once cancer growth is slowed, your immune system can begin to get ahead of the cancer cells, because it doesn?t have to deal with such an overabundance of them. It?s just disposing of the leftovers. Low Vitamin D Predicts Aggressive Prostate Cancer In related news, researchers at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine recently discovered that men diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer have vitamin D levels below 23 ng/ml. According to this study, vitamin D may actually be used as a biomarker to predict the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. As noted in a University press release:15 ?The relationship between vitamin D and prostate cancer may explain some disparities seen in prostate cancer, especially among African American men. Prior research?showed African American men who live in low sunlight locations are up to 1? times more likely to have vitamin D deficiency than Caucasian men. But because vitamin D is a biomarker for bone health and aggressiveness of other diseases, all men should check their levels, [lead investigator Dr. Adam] Murphy said. ?All men should be replenishing their vitamin D to normal levels,? Murphy said. ?It?s smart preventive health care.? Vitamin D Dramatically Improves Heart Function Yet another recent study found that vitamin D has ?nothing short of amazing? ability to improve heart function in those with chronic heart failure. The five-year long trial included 160 patients undergoing conventional treatment for chronic heart failure; half of them were given a vitamin D3 supplement, the other half received a placebo in addition to their standard of care. After one year, the vitamin D group experienced significant improvement in heart function compared to the placebo group. As reported by The Independent:16 ?Dr Klaus Witte, who led the?research project, told The Independent the improvements seen in patients taking the vitamin were ?nothing short of amazing,? and called his team?s findings a ?significant breakthrough?? Researchers made ultrasound scans of participants? hearts and measured the how much blood was being pumped with each heartbeat, to get a figure called ejection fraction. The ejection fraction of a healthy person is usually around 60 to 70 per cent, but it dropped to an average of 26 per cent among the patients enrolled in the study. For those who took vitamin D3, the ejection fraction was improved from 26 to 34 per cent, while the rest experienced not change. For some patients, this discovery means regularly taking vitamin D3 could lessen the need for them to be fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), which can correct dangerous heart rhythms.? The researchers note that even though they used a vitamin D3 supplement in this study, exposure to sunlight ?would likely produce the same results,? for the simple reason that it?s all about achieving a higher vitamin D serum level. Comparing our modern lifestyle to that of ancient humans who spent far more time outdoors, the researchers link our current deficiency epidemic to chronic sun avoidance. Current Advice to Avoid Sun Exposure Seriously Endangers Your Health Indeed, dermatologists have severely compromised the public health by fighting an irrational and dangerous war against UV exposure, be it from the sun or UV light devices. Disease statistics reveal the sun-scare campaign has really been taken too far. At present, the U.S. Surgeon General,17,18 the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), and many other cancer organizations recommend complete and total sun avoidance in order to prevent skin cancer. The AAD will not even acknowledge different recommendations based on skin type, even though it?s widely recognized that darker skinned individuals need far more UV exposure in order to produce vitamin D in their skin. Adding insult to injury, the U.S. Preventative Task Force suggests vitamin D testing is unnecessary, and both the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the American Medical Association (AMA) recommend vitamin D serum levels and vitamin D intake levels that are far below ideal based on the evidence in the medical literature. The IOM recommends taking just 600 IUs of vitamin D a day up to age 70. But as pointed out in a 2014 paper,19 the IOM underestimates the need by a factor of 10 due to a mathematical error. This error has never been addressed. Moreover, research20 suggests it would require 9,600 IU?s of vitamin D per day to get a majority (97.5 percent) of the population to reach 40ng/ ml. Meanwhile, the AMA uses of 20ng/ml as sufficient, but as shown in the featured study, this level significantly increases your risk for cancer; 40 ng/ml is really the cutoff point for sufficiency in order to prevent a wide range of diseases. Sun Avoidance Equals Smoking in Terms of Mortality Risk Sun avoidance actually increases your risk of death very similar to that of smoking. That was the conclusion of a recent ?competing risk? analysis by Swedish researchers, who found that while women with active sun exposure habits had a higher risk of melanoma compared to sun avoiders, they also had a lower risk of mortality from far more deadly diseases than melanoma, including cardiovascular disease. According to the authors:21 ?Nonsmokers who avoided sun exposure had a life expectancy similar to smokers in the highest sun exposure group, indicating that avoidance of sun exposure is a risk factor for death of a similar magnitude as smoking. Compared to the highest sun exposure group, life expectancy of avoiders of sun exposure was reduced by 0.6?2.1 years.? When you look at the overall picture, it?s clear to see that we are building the perfect storm for serious negative health outcomes due to vitamin D deficiency. The Role of Vitamin D in Disease Prevention A growing body of evidence shows that vitamin D plays a crucial role in disease prevention and maintaining optimal health. There are about 30,000 genes in your body, and vitamin D affects nearly 3,000 of them, as well as vitamin D receptors located throughout your body. According to one large-scale study, optimal Vitamin D levels can slash your risk of cancer by as much as 60 percent. Keeping your levels optimized can help prevent at least 16 different types of cancer, including pancreatic, lung, ovarian, prostate, and skin cancers. How Vitamin D Performance Testing Can Help Optimize Your Health Is it any wonder then that no matter what disease or condition is investigated, vitamin D appears to play a crucial role? This is why I am so excited about the D*Action Project by GrassrootsHealth. Dr. Robert Heaney is the research director of GrassrootsHealth and is part of the design of the D*action Project as well as analysis of the research findings. GrassrootsHealth shows how you can take action today on known science with a consensus of experts without waiting for institutional lethargy. It has shown how by combining the science of measurement (of vitamin D levels) with the personal choice of taking action and, the value of education about individual measures that one can truly be in charge of their own health. In order to spread this health movement to more communities, the project needs your involvement. To participate, simply purchase the D*Action Measurement Kit and follow the registration instructions included. (Please note that 100 percent of the proceeds from the kits go to fund the research project. I do not charge a single dime as a distributor of the test kits.) As a participant, you agree to test your vitamin D levels twice a year during a five-year study, and share your health status to demonstrate the public health impact of this nutrient. There is a $65 fee every six months for your sponsorship of this research project, which includes a test kit to be used at home, and electronic reports on your ongoing progress. You will get a follow up email every six months reminding you ?it?s time for your next test and health survey.?

The movie follows Williams' career from his breakthrough in the 1940s to his death from heart failure, slumped in the back of his Cadillac, at the age of 29 in 1953. British actor Hiddlestone attends the Evening Standard Theatre awards in London London-born ""Thor"" actor, Hiddleston, said one of the biggest challenges he faced was learning Williams' accent. ""He has a resonant tone of a gospel preacher, which comes from something deep in his southern roots,"" he told Reuters at the film's premiere in Los Angeles on Tuesday night. ""As soon as I started to listen to the cadence and the musicality of the way he spoke, that was when it clicked for me."" He described the singer-songwriter - whose hits included ""Your Cheatin' Heart"" and ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" - as ""a cornerstone in the development of American music"". ""Music is the most evocative, most immediately emotional art form, I think. My admiration for singers is huge and I think singing is the most naked means of expression, there's nothing to hide behind,"" Hiddleston said. The film also looks at Williams' relationship with his first wife Audrey, played by ""Avengers"" star Elizabeth Olsen, which grew more tempestuous as the singer relied increasingly on painkillers and alcohol. It is one of several music biopics, including ""Miles Ahead"" with Don Cheadle as Miles Davis and ""Born to Be Blue"" in which Ethan Hawke portrays Chet Baker, to be released this year. ""I Saw the Light"" opens in cinemas in Los Angeles, New York and Nashville on Friday.

Epub 2016 Jan 28. PMID: 27052923 Abstract Title: Habitual chocolate consumption and the risk of incident heart failure among healthy men and women. Abstract: BACKGROUND: We aimed to examine the association between chocolate intake and the risk of incident heart failure in a UK general population. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify this association.METHODS AND RESULTS: We used data from a prospective population-based study, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk cohort. Chocolate intake was quantified based on a food frequency questionnaire obtained at baseline (1993-1997) and incident heart failure was ascertained up to March 2009. We supplemented the primary data with a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies which evaluated risk of incident heart failure with chocolate consumption. A total of 20,922 participants (53% women; mean age 58 ? 9 years) were included of whom 1101 developed heart failure during the follow up (mean 12.5 ? 2.7 years, total person years 262,291 years). After adjusting for lifestyle and dietary factors, we found 19% relative reduction in heart failure incidence in the top (up to 100 g/d) compared to the bottom quintile of chocolate consumption (HR 0.81 95%CI 0.66-0.98) but the results were no longer significant after controlling for comorbidities (HR 0.87 95%CI 0.71-1.06). Additional adjustment for potential mediators did not attenuate the results further. We identified five relevant studies including the current study (N = 75,408). The pooled results showed non-significant 19% relative risk reduction of heart failure incidence with higher chocolate consumption (HR 0.81 95%CI 0.66-1.01).CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that higher chocolate intake is not associated with subsequent incident heart failure.",0

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the measure ended an """"absurd situation"""" whereby someone who """"supports terror"""" was allowed to serve in the Knesset.But critics said it was anti-democratic and aimed mainly at Israeli Arab MPs. The law would require three-quarters of the Knesset's 120 members to vote in favour of any impeachment motion. The move comes a week after the European Union warned that the Knesset had risked undermining democracy and freedom of speech by approving legislation that requires NGOs receiving most of their funding from abroad to declare so publicly. Blame and bitterness keeping peace at bay Israeli-Palestinian tensions return to boiling point A spokeswoman for the Association of Civil Rights in Israel expressed similar concerns about the new impeachment law, which was approved by 62 votes to 47 early on Wednesday.""""It harms the very building blocks of democracy - the right to freedom of expression, the right to vote and to be elected, and the right to representation,""""said Debbie Gilad-Hayo.

More than 200 Palestinians - mostly attackers, Israel says - have also been killed in that period. The assailants who have been killed have been shot either by their victims or by security forces as they carried out attacks. Other Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops.On Tuesday, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy was killed during a clash in the occupied West Bank town of al-Ram, the Palestinian health ministry said. Muhey al-Tabakhi died as a result of a wound inflicted by a projectile that struck his chest and caused heart failure, according to a ministry spokesman.

In addition, the negative sentiment around the British pound is showing few signs of abating, with investors fearing that the recent Brexit could cause the UK to enter another recession. As the sterling continues to decline, a steep rise in the cost of imports is likely to send inflation spiraling, which will then force the Bank of England to raise interest rates. In addition, 1.5 percentage points are likely to be knocked off the GDP growth in 2017, which will also negatively impact the growth rate in the country. According to Daniel Diehl, the head analyst at 23Traders, the GBP is likely to bear the brunt of the major adjustments that will now take place in Britain following the recent Brexit. He explained, ""The pro-Brexit outcome has pushed the GBP lower against other major currencies, such as the euro and the US dollar. Trading binary options on these currency pairs enables traders to profit from these declines since this form of trading allows traders to take advantage of markets movements, whether they are moving in an upward or downward trend."" Diehl went on to say, ""Since the discussion of the Brexit started in December, we have seen a decline of 12.5pc in the GBP against the euro and a decline of 6.8pc against the US dollar. In fact, in mid-February, after Boris Johnson's decision to join the Brexit campaign, the pound fell as low as $1.38."" He went on to explain, ""The traders at 23Traders have been able to profit on this consistent decline in the GBP and while the currency is likely to stabilize in due course, our traders can continue to maximize their profits on this downward trend. In addition, as the GBP stabilizes over time, 23Traders can then easily change their trading strategies to meet this market movement. Either way, it is a win-win scenario for traders.""

The answer is simple; they are the many illnesses the U.S. government has admitted are associated with the exposure to Agent Orange. Hopefully with time, our government will admit there are other diseases caused by their spraying of herbicides and defoliants than they originally admitted to. Some may ask what Agent Orange is and believe it or not, more and younger people have never heard of that term even though it has caused illnesses or deaths of thousands of people. What is interesting is I was at a doctor?s office not too long ago and a medical assistant ask me what Agent Orange was when I mentioned that it had caused most of my medical issues. The term Agent Orange is derived from the combination of code names for Herbicide Orange (HO) and Agent LNX. Agent Orange was one of the herbicides and defoliants used by the U.S. military as part of its chemical warfare program, Operation Ranch Hand, during the Vietnam Conflict from 1961 through 1971. And besides that, the 55-gallon drums the deadly toxins were shipped in had a big orange strip around it, thus where the name Agent Orange came from. During the Vietnam War, the United States military sprayed millions of gallons of deadly material containing chemical herbicides and defoliants in Vietnam, eastern Laos and parts of Cambodia. According to the worldwide web, the program?s goal was, ??to defoliate forested and rural land, depriving guerrillas of cover and to induce forced draft urbanization, destroying the ability of peasants to support themselves in the countryside, and forcing them to flee to the U.S. dominated cities, thus depriving the guerrillas of their rural support and food supply?? Many are unaware the U.S. government also sprayed Agent Orange in Korea. Many of the people exposed to Agent Orange, and I?ll call them poor souls, didn?t find out the true justification for their debilitating illnesses until later in life. And some never found out what caused their illnesses before they died. Another interesting fact is some Vietnam veterans who have had or now have diseases brought on by exposure to Agent Orange Dioxin is not alone and many of their children are also infected by Agent Orange. These children, through birth, are the second generation of people suffering from Agent Orange exposure and many wonder if there will there be a third or fourth generation? The U.S. Government has continued an attempt to downplay the effects of exposure to Agent Orange. The Red Cross of Vietnam estimates that up to one million Vietnamese people are disabled or have health problems due to Agent Orange, but the U.S. government has dismissed these figures as unreliable and unrealistically high. Many Americans are currently suffering or have died from the consequences of Agent Orange exposure without ever receiving medical care of monetary compensation. Conservative is estimates are that more than 2.4 million Americans (in addition to allied forces and the Vietnamese people) were exposed to the deadly brew of pesticides and defoliants. I guess I?m one of the more lucky ones who now receive medical care and monetary compensation from my illnesses due to my exposure to Agent Orange (for information purposes, I served in Vietnam during 1967, 68, 69 and 70). Just think, I left Vietnam in 1970, but the government didn?t admit my illnesses were not associated to Agent Orange until about 42 years later. The money is great, but the debilitating effects I suffer from my exposure to Agent Orange continues and each day. I look healthier than I really am. I have learned more about some of past illnesses and some from ones that are now surfacing. Here is my who?s who of illnesses I have either suffered or currently now suffer: Heart attack and quadruple bypass operation (yep I was cracked open like a walnut) in 2003; Congestive Heart Failure; Ischemic Heart Disease; Type II Diabetes; High blood pressure; Skin Cancer; Neuropathy; and They implanted a pacemaker in me last year. I am also suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, better known as COPD, but the U.S. government hasn?t yet admitted it is caused by my exposure to Agent Orange. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, an Agent Orange Settlement Fund was created by the resolution of the Agent Orange Product Liability Litigation ? a class action lawsuit brought by Vietnam Veterans and their families regarding injuries allegedly incurred as a result of the exposure by Vietnam Veterans to chemical herbicides used during the Vietnam Conflict (remember they never designated it as a war). The suit was brought against the major manufacturers of these herbicides. The class action case was settled out-of-court in 1984 for $180 million dollars, reportedly the largest settlement of its kind at that time. The Settlement Fund was distributed to class members in accordance with a distribution plan established by United States District Court Judge Jack B. Weinstein, who presided over the litigation and the settlement. Because the plaintiff class was so large (an estimated 10 million people), the Fund was distributed to class members in the United States through two separate programs designed to provide maximum benefits to Vietnam Veterans and their families most in need of assistance: A Payment Program that provided cash compensation to totally-disabled veterans and survivors of deceased veterans; and A Class Assistance Program that provided funds for social services organizations and networks for the purpose of establishing and maintaining programs for the benefit of the class as a whole. Applications for the Payment Program had to be submitted prior to December 31, 1994 and program operated over a period of 6 ? years distributing a total of $197 million in cash payments to members of the class action in the United States. Of the 105,000 claims received by the Payment Program, approximately 52,000 Vietnam Veterans or their survivors received cash payments which averaged about $3,800 each (not much for their suffering and/or death). On September 27, 1997, the District Court ordered the Fund closed, its assets having been fully distributed Another sad thing to come about was the Supreme Court put the preverbal skids on thousands of Americans who faithfully served their county during the Vietnam War and Korea, and who were exposed to the Agent Orange by making a ruling in 2009? The Supreme Court let stand a lower court rulings that the companies were not responsible for the implications of military use of Agent Orange because the war materials were supplied at the direction of the U.S. government. That decision basically made it impossible for individuals exposed to Agent Orange to be able to sue Dow Chemical and Monsanto. South Korea?s highest court upheld a ruling during July 2013, ordering two U.S. Agent Orange makers to compensate 39 Vietnam War veterans in one of the country?s most prominent lawsuits. The Supreme Court recognized the epidemiological correlation between the toxic defoliant Agent Orange and skin diseases for the first time, saying the 39 victims should receive a total of 466 million won (HK$3.21 million) from Dow Chemical and Monsanto. It isn?t too late for those U.S. military veterans and their families to receive medical care and financial aid. The Veterans Administration continues to attempt to help those military personnel and their families suffering from various illnesses brought on by their exposure to deadly toxin, but they can only do so much. Spouses and dependent children of living veterans also may be eligible for health care and other VA benefits and surviving spouses, dependent children and dependent parents of veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange or other herbicides during military service and died as the result of diseases related to the exposure may be eligible for survivors? benefits. If a military veteran, dependent of a veteran or a parent of a veteran believes their illnesses was caused by exposure to Agent Orange, they should contact their nearest veteran?s service officer, fraternal veteran?s service organization or Department of Veterans Affairs in order to learn more about applying for disability through the VA.",1

I would hope to have a similar experience during foundation years, though like you, I've been told it's terrible as a career and to steer well clear. I'm not that interested in the long term management of chronic conditions e.g. heart failure, asthma, etc, but I find learning about the acute exacerbations of the same conditions really interesting. Not a big fan of clinics or ward rounds either, but still really enjoy clerkings and presenting patients. I also really like learning practical procedures and the idea of being a generalist is appealing. All of the EM physicians I've been attached to have been great teachers, and I think it's a specialty which would lend itself well to clinical teaching. Not going to deny that it's physically tiring and whilst I don't mind night shifts, I don't like it when they yo-yo and leave you feeling jet lagged (new contract looks awful for this) - so I'll be interested to see what I'll make of it (hopefully) once I've qualified. How about you? Really similar reasons actually. I don't like the long ward rounds and constant irrelevant shuffling of treatment in medicine. But I'm certainly no surgeon either. I love seeing patients acutely, working out the problem, doing a wide range of, practical procudures, and then never having to see them again. Don't get me wrong, I love people, but I don't really like to get bogged down in complicated stuff. I like the fact that it's intense, tiring, and when you're there you have to be very present, and then when it's done it's DONE and you go home. Nothing better. I also don't mind working unsociable hours. In many ways I prefer them, I'm a definite night owl and will happily take the extra money and be awake at a time that suits me nicely. The unavoidable shift-work nature is something of a concern. But my ideal plan is to locum for half of the year, and travel the rest. Not sure how viable that is, and everything's up in the air right now. I don't know, I can't actually see myself doing anything else except maybe GP, and GP doesn't exactly enthuse me.",0

That's a start at least. It is an acknowledgement by you that pictures taken of dead people in a hospital don't have sufficient shock appeal as pictures of dead people in detention centres would. Now for the next question. Why would detention centres send bodies of their alleged victims to a hospital?? Do they think they can be cured?? Do they think the hospital is a crematorium?? For a handful of bodies one could see why perhaps, but for 1000s? when they are being killed on an industrial scale? pftt. Answer in your own time. All such issues were addressed in the 2014 HRW report following extensive investigations and verification You should read it before exposing your ignorance After a detainee died, security branch guards transported the body to military hospitals where they would place it in a morgue or, when the number of bodies outstripped a hospital?s capacity, in an open-air garage. According to two defectors who served in two different military hospitals, after their facilities collected a group of detainees? bodies, a forensic doctor would come to the morgue or courtyard and give each corpse a specific ?examination number? (which appears along with a detainee?s detention facility number and a detainee number assigned by that facility in the Caesar photographs). Then the doctor would write a medical report, allow the body to be photographed by a military forensic photographer, and order conscripts to wrap the body in plastic sheeting. According to Fahed al-Mahmoud, a defector who served in the Harasta military hospital, these medical reports typically cited the cause of death as heart failure. Caesar, according to the international legal team that interviewed him, also said that regardless of actual cause of death medical reports only cited two causes of death: heart failure or respiratory failure. Human Rights Watch reviewed three death certificates that listed one of these two causes, but none that cited other causes of death.",0

(Photo by Dean Musgrove/Los Angeles Daily News) By City News Service # Comments LOS ANGELES ? Relatives of former first lady Nancy Reagan gathered for a private memorial in Santa Monica today before her casket was placed in a hearse and driven in a solemn motorcade to her husband?s presidential library, where she will be laid to rest Friday. Reagan, who died in her sleep Sunday at her Bel Air home at age 94, will be buried within inches of her husband, an eternal continuation of her decades-long love affair with the nation?s 40th president and former governor of California. The former first lady helped plan many of the details of her memorial and funeral service, from the pallbearers to the guest list to the exact location of her burial at her husband?s side. Relatives gathered at the Gates, Kingsley & Gates Moeller Murphy funeral home in Santa Monica around 9 a.m. for a private gathering. Shortly before 10 a.m., Nancy Reagan?s casket was placed in a large black hearse to begin her final voyage to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley. Her casket was attended by eight pallbearers -- all U.S. Secret Service agents who worked for her or her husband over the years. Assistant Special Agent in Charge Michael Kinnersley was assigned to President Ronald Reagan after he left office, according to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation. The seven others all served Nancy Reagan: Supervisory Special Officer Christopher Cousino and special agents Thomas Feuerborn, Tim Yoshitake, Cory Chhiap, Steven Kulpaca, Nathan Judd and Melanie Lentz. As the motorcade made its way north on the San Diego (405) Freeway, onlookers could be seen on overpasses to watch the procession below. Los Angeles Fire Department displayed large American flags at a pair of locations along the route. When the motorcade fittingly transitioned to the westbound Ronald Reagan (118) Freeway, about a dozen LAFD firefighters stood at attention along the shoulder of the roadway and saluted as the hearse passed. Nancy Reagan will lie in repose at the Reagan Library from 1 to 7 p.m. and again from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Thursday, giving members of the public a chance to view her casket and bid farewell. People hoping to view the casket will not be able to drive to the museum but will have to park at the former Bank of America property at 400 National Way in Simi Valley and take a shuttle. Ronald Reagan Foundation officials noted that security will be tight and advised people not to bring large bags, cameras or strollers. Gifts and flowers will only be accepted at the bottom of Presidential Drive and at the shuttle pickup location. According to the foundation, Nancy Reagan requested that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to the Ronald Reagan Memorial Fund at www.reaganlibrary.com. Advertisement The Reagan library will remain closed to the general public until 10 a.m. Sunday. There?s no estimate of how many people will attend during the two-day visitation, but the museum is bracing for large crowds since Nancy Reagan?s funeral service at 11 a.m. Friday will be closed to the public. A trio of former first ladies, including Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, are among those expected to attend Friday?s funeral service, along with current first lady Michelle Obama, although President Barack Obama is not expected to be there. Former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, are also expected to attend, along with former first lady Rosalynn Carter, according to officials at the Reagan Library. Tricia Nixon Cox, a daughter of President Richard Nixon, is also expected. Other guests expected to attend, according to the Reagan Foundation are Capt. Christopher Bolt, the commander of the USS Ronald Reagan; Katie Couric; Sam Donaldson; Chris Matthews; Newt and Callista Gingrich; Wayne Newton; Anjelica Huston; Melissa Rivers; Tina Sinatra; and Mr. T, the burly actor who took an active role in Nancy Reagan?s ?Just Say No? anti-drug campaign in the 1980s. The Rev. Stuart A. Kenworthy, vicar of Washington National Cathedral, officiated today?s private family service in Santa Monica, assisted by the REv. Donn Moomaw, the Reagan?s family minister. Kenworthy will also lead Friday?s funeral service. U.S. flags on public buildings across the country -- and at the Reagan Library -- were lowered to half-staff in her memory Monday, following a directive from President Barack Obama. A fierce protector of her husband?s presidential legacy, the woman behind the ?Just Say No? campaign and the first lady known for tasteful glamour at the White House, Nancy Reagan died of congestive heart failure while asleep at the Bel Air home where she had lived since 1989. The Reagans were married in March 1952 and purchased a home in Pacific Palisades, where they lived until a move to Sacramento in 1966. They had two children together, Patti and Ron Jr., and she also helped raise Ronald Reagan?s two children with his first wife, Jane Wyman. Ronald and Nancy Reagan were both actors, but ?Hellcats Of the Navy? in 1957 was the only movie in which they appeared together, although she continued to act in TV and minor movie roles. Her biggest roles, however, were not on the screen, but as Ronald Reagan?s adviser, counselor and protector when he was in public life, and later, as his chief caregiver after he became stricken by Alzheimer?s disease. Reagan died in June 2004. Reagan?s daughter, Patti Davis, said in a statement on her website that her mother ?had been in poor health for quite a while, and recently had gotten markedly worse, so this wasn?t a surprise.? ?That said, death always feels like a surprise,? she said. ?I appreciate the attention and prayers of people I will probably never meet. Just as when my father died, there is comfort in feeling surrounded by gentle thoughts and kind wishes, often sent out by strangers. ?And just as when my father died, we will honor my mother publicly -- stand on the public stage and share as much as we can. Then, when that is completed, we?ll draw the circle in a little tighter and deal with the often complicated map of personal loss.?",0

So far the strategy has only been tested in mice, where it proved highly effective. But the results are promising enough that the researchers are planning to launch clinical trials in cancer patients within a year. The new work is ?very innovative stuff,? says Steven Libutti, a geneticist and cancer surgeon at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, who was not involved in the study. The treatment, he explains, works in three steps to place a conventional chemotherapeutic agent near the nucleus (or nuclei) of a metastatic cancer cell where the drug molecules are most lethal. ?It?s almost like a multistage rocket? that lifts astronauts off Earth, sends them to the moon, and returns them safely, he says. At the heart of the new therapy is a chemotherapeutic agent called doxorubicin (dox). The drug has been a mainstay of cancer treatment for years, as it jams up DNA in the cell nucleus and prevents tumor cells from dividing. But when it?s injected into the bloodstream, the drug can also kill heart muscle cells and cause heart failure, which often forces oncologists to either dial back the dose or discontinue it altogether. Delivering dox only to tumor cells is therefore highly desirable, but it has been a major challenge. Hoping to provide such cell specificity, researchers led by Mauro Ferrari, a nanomedicine expert, as well as president and CEO of the Houston Methodist Research Institute in Texas, have spent years developing porous silicon particles as drug carriers. The particles? micrometer-scale size and disklike shape allows them travel unimpeded through normal blood vessels. But when they hit blood vessels around tumors, which are typically malformed and leaky, the particles fall out of the circulation and pool near the tumor. That was step one in delivering chemotherapeutic drugs to their target. But just filling such particles with dox doesn?t do much good, Ferrari says. Even if a small amount of the drug finds its way inside tumor cells, those cells often have membrane proteins that act as tiny pumps to push the drug back outside the cell before it can do any damage. Silicon particles act as nanoparticle generators (iNPG) that carry stringlike polymers loaded with a chemotherapy compound called doxorubicin (p-Dox). Nature Biotechnology To get large amounts of dox inside the metastatic tumor cells and then past the protein pumps, Ferrari and colleagues linked numerous dox molecules to stringlike molecules called polymers. They then infused the dox-carrying polymers into their silicon microparticles and injected them into mice that had been implanted with human metastatic liver and lung tumors. As with the previous studies, the researchers found that the silicon particles congregated in and around tumor sites, and once there the particles slowly degraded over 2 to 4 weeks. As they did so, the silicon particles released the dox-carrying polymer strands. In the watery environment around tumor cells, the strands coiled up into tiny balls, each just 20?80 nanometers across. That size, Ferrari says, is ideal, because it?s the same size as tiny vesicles that are commonly exchanged between neighboring cells as part of their normal chemical communication. In this case, the dox-polymer balls were readily taken up by tumor cells. Once there, a large fraction was carried internally away from the dox-exporting pumps at cell membrane and toward the nucleus. Ferrari says at this point his team isn?t sure exactly why the dox-laden balls are ferried toward the nucleus, though this is exactly what they wanted. Not only is the region around the nucleus devoid of dox-removing pumps, but it typically has a more acidic environment than near the cell membrane. And Ferrari?s team used this to their advantage as well. They designed the chemical links between dox molecules and the polymer to dissolve under acidic conditions. This releases the dox at the site where its cell killing potency is highest. Up to 50% of cancer-bearing mice given the treatment showed no signs of metastatic tumors 8 months later , the researchers report today in Nature Biotechnology . In humans, Ferrari says, that?s equivalent to being cancer-free for 24 years. ?If this research bears out in humans and we see even a fraction of this survival time, we are still talking about dramatically extending life for many years,? Ferrari says. ?That?s essentially providing a cure in a patient population that is now being told there is none.? The new treatment isn?t the first nanomedicine to show promise. According to a recent nanotechnology working group study published in The Lancet , more than 50 nanomedicine compounds are now in clinical trials . However, the new work is promising, Libutti says, because the silicon microparticles tend to target tumors in the liver and lung, common destinations of metastatic tumor cells. The new work holds out hope for improving the effectiveness of other chemotherapy drugs as well, Libutti says. ?There?s no reason to believe you couldn?t make a version of these particles with any chemotherapeutic agent.?

So I've been trying to do as much research as I can before making the post, but I may as well make some inquiries since I'm hitting an impasse. Background: I had a 49cc motor that basically soft seized and was getting terrible compression. Eventually opened it up (6 months later now that I've got a little bit of time) and found that the piston certainly had its heyday is pretty much toast now, as you can see in the pic. The original thread I made is here, but I'll bring you guys up to speed in this thread either way so you don't have to read it all: viewtopic.php?f=2&t=27303 My old motor was getting super low compression (~30 on my *oh-so-world-renound* Harbor Freight compression tester), so instead of getting a new 49cc cylinder I opted to upgrade. So I bought an Athena 70cc kit and a Dellorto 17.5mm PHBN carb, with a set of jets from 80 to 88 (which I have not installed yet) and 5 BR9HS plugs to chop. Yesterday we removed the old cylinder and installed the new 70cc Athena. One disclaimer, however. We installed the new cylinder, piston, etc, properly lubed up and getting 0.9mm squish (as per the instructions), but we did not install this rubber o-ring here because we could not find a place for it and it wasn't covered in the instructions at all: In videos for other cylinder installations, the head has a place for this rubber ring, and you lube it up and place it there when installing the cylinder. But the head on my cylinder had no place for it (trust me, I checked every possible way that it could sit there). So we installed everything without it, and it has the proper squish and everything. But of course, it seems like I probably misunderstood where it's supposed to go and therefore put it all together without ever realizing I was skipping a step. However, we did everything as legitimately as possible so I'm not sure which step I would've missed. Maybe it's a totally critical piece, maybe it's a total non-issue piece, I literally have no idea. So the cylinder is installed, the reeds are installed, the new PHBN carb is installed, the new spark plug is installed, etc. I tried getting it to start without the exhaust attached, which I later realize may have been a mistake. So I attached the exhaust, but not the airbox, and have continued to try and get this thing started. Thus far to no avail. I don't have an electric start, so I'm working solely with kick starts. I used the compression tester again and it would give me a reading of ~90psi (as to be expected from a HF compression tester), but after more rigorous kicking it moves up to 110-115psi. With more rigorous kicking I honestly think I could get it up to 120, but the return spring on my kick starter is super shitty/weak, and I'm a small man so it's physically exhausting to keep kicking and kicking in this hot weather. So I think my compression is fine with the new motor. When we installed the PHBN carb, we used the needle assembly from the stock carb (also of Dellorto manufacture) because I don't know how to change them out. They appeared to be about the same, though. UPDATE: IGNORE THE UNDERLINED TEXT, I replaced the full carb . The air screw is set at 1 and 1/3 screws out, and I'm not sure what the fuel screw is at currently. I planned to tune the carb after it got running, but do you guys think I need to tune the carb ahead of time just to get the scooter running? I haven't touched the jets or the float at all on the new carb. I believe the carb is getting fuel, since the hose is wet when I pull it off the carb. The oil line, however, is dry thus far, and I'm pretty sure I need to get a new oil hose because the one I have is cracking really badly at the mouth, and I need to zip tie it to keep it on the carb nipple. I don't have ANY more slack on the hose, otherwise I would just cut the end and reattach it. So I need to replace the hose, I believe, so I've ordered parts #10 and #11 from here http://www.jerseyshorepowersports.com/f ... veh=175798 . It may not be the right hose, but I'm hoping it will be. In the meantime, with the zip-tied hose, how do I get the oil to travel into the carb? Until the time of writing this post, I think it has been attached too loosely and I just now went out and affixed it more firmly with the zip tie for a better seal, however temporary. How do I bleed the line to get rid of the air in the tube? The manual mentions bleeding the autopump, but when I unscrew that bleed screw, the oil just comes out right there by the fan cover and not down the hose at the carb end (obviously, given the physics of the bleed screw location). So how do I get oil down the line? I'm hoping I haven't done any damage yet by kicking it over so many times without realizing the oil line wasn't affixed firmly. I read in this post viewtopic.php?f=39&t=23158 that it mentions applying vacuum to the petcock to prime the carb, and I'm not sure how to do that (all of the pictures in the tutorial have expired). I'm hoping the scooter isn't starting simply because I haven't done enough to prime the new parts for proper ignition. But because I'm in an area where I haven't seen much literature, I'm no longer sure how to diagnose the situation. I haven't been able to find a whole lot of information about what I specifically need to do once the new parts are completely installed. The good news is that the issue ought not to be a problem with cylinder wear since it's brand new and has never fired before. And once it's running, I'll tune the carb so that wear on the engine is at a minimum. But I can't do that yet since I can't even get it to start. I read in this thread viewtopic.php?f=39&t=23516 that it took OP over 100 kicks to get it started, so I don't know if my issue is because I haven't given it enough kicks (trust me when I say I was kicking the stool out of that kick starter) on the new motor or what. But I would guess that it's because I'm skipping some important step for prepping a new engine setup. Any ideas? Thanks for reading, guys.

Results from the trial, called HOPE-3, could prod far more doctors to add a statin to blood pressure therapy for such patients who have no prior history of heart attack or stroke, researchers said. The data was presented on Saturday at the annual scientific sessions of the American College of Cardiology in Chicago. To enroll in the trial, patients had to have at least one risk factor for heart disease such as obesity or smoking, in addition to being over 60 for women and over 55 for men. ""Intermediate-risk people with hypertension had a clear benefit when taking both a statin and an agent that lowers blood pressure,"" Dr. Salim Yusuf, a professor of cardiology at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada who headed the 12,000-patient global study, said in an interview. Patients with systolic blood pressure of 140 and higher were deemed in the study to have high blood pressure. They experienced a 40 percent reduced risk of heart attack and stroke over a six-year period when taking AstraZeneca Plc's Crestor statin as well as a combination tablet containing blood pressure treatment candesartan and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide. Patients with normal or low systolic pressure had the same approximate 25 percent reduction in cardiovascular events as seen among patients in one arm of the study who took only statins. Yusuf said the trial underscores that if a patient at moderate heart risk has high blood pressure, defined as 140 or higher, ""give them both a statin and a blood pressure medication as a matter of course."" He said statins are not automatically given now to patients with hypertension that are at only moderate risk of heart attack or stroke. Yusuf's trial included research centers in China, India, Latin America, Africa and Canada, but not the United States because of far greater research costs there. The trial was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and AstraZeneca. A separate study published in November found that lowering blood pressure to below 120 dramatically reduced heart failure and risk of death in adults aged 50 and older. But the five-year U.S. government-sponsored study of more than 9,300 patients showed a higher rate of adverse side effects, including kidney damage, in the aggressively treated patients.

The problem is that the care gets so bogged down. For example, if a patient comes into the ED with a heart failure exacerbation, it's often because they didn't take a medication called Lasix. This is entirely preventable. But because this patient with a preventable problem is taking up an ED bed, that means we can't treat someone else who may need to be treated. This doesn't sound like that big of a deal until you take into account all of the little things that have to happen before this patient with a preventable problem is admitted from the ED to the inpatient unit to free up that ED bed for another patient. I have to see the patient (I have 10 other patients I also have to take care of), I have to interview the patient, do a physical exam and draw blood to see what's going on. The blood takes about 1-1.5 hours from the time that it was drawn to when I get the results. In the meantime I start treatment and call the internal medicine team to admit the patient. It takes the internal medicine team between 30-45 minutes to come see the patient and put in orders to admit the patient to the inpatient unit. Then I have to wait for the admissions nurse to find an inpatient bed for this patient to go to. Another physician in administration then reviews my notes and checks to see if the patient meets criteria to be admitted to the inpatient unit. About 4 hours after the patient is first put in an ED bed, they're finally moved up to the inpatient unit. All of this was because the patient did not take one medication.",0

No Comments According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 610,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year ? that's one in every four deaths. The impact of cardiovascular diseases is quite large. The University of Alabama at Birmingham is home to many talented investigators who study various aspects of heart disease within the School of Medicine's Division of Cardiovascular Disease, at the Comprehensive Cardiovascular Center and across UAB . A primary goal of both the division and CCVC is to actively promote innovative, interdisciplinary and translational cardiovascular research. Many distinct ? yet often complementary ? basic and clinical studies are ongoing at UAB. With Alabama's ranking among states with the most heart-related deaths, this innovative research is providing benefits to patients now and in the future. UAB researchers are focusing on five key areas with an ultimate goal of improving the care of CVD patients. Heart failure Heart failure is a chronic, progressive condition in which the heart muscle is unable to function adequately and distribute sufficient oxygen and nutrients to meet the body's needs. In other words, the heart cannot maintain its workload. Multiple researchers at UAB are investigating the mechanisms by which heart failure occurs, as well as searching for ways to prevent heart failure and devise improved treatment strategies. Heart failure can arise as a consequence of ischemic events, such as a heart attack ? indeed, heart attack survivors are at increased risk for heart failure development. Ongoing research is trying to uncover the nature of this relationship. During ischemic events, the immune system becomes activated, which is essential for the repair of the heart. However, inappropriate activation of immune cells results in chronic inflammation, which worsens damage to the heart, thereby contributing to heart failure development. Director of the UAB Cardiovascular Disease Division and the CCVC Sumanth Prabhu, M.D., is currently focusing on the role of specific immune cell populations in producing heart damage, and on finding a way to manipulate immune systems so they do not become hyperactivated. Similarly, research in the laboratory of Ganesh Halade, Ph.D., is studying novel lipid species, known as resolvins, which are able to reverse inflammation in the heart. Roger White, Ph.D., and his collaborator, G.M. Anantharamaiah, Ph.D., are exploring the anti-inflammatory properties of high-density lipoprotein mimetic compounds in atherosclerosis and other disease states. Other important areas of heart failure research involve energetics, regeneration, cellular survival and remodeling. Studies in the laboratory of Min Xie, M.D., are currently defining whether activation of self-preservation mechanisms such as autophagy promote survival of heart cells, thereby attenuating contractile dysfunction following a heart attack. In terms of remodeling, Louis Dell'Italia, M.D., is studying the mechanisms of extracellular matrix remodeling during heart failure, which can lead to stiffening of the heart. Both Xie and Dell'Italia have identified novel therapeutic targets that improve cardiac function in pre-clinical models. Heart failure research further extends to the clinic, with multiple active clinical studies assessing the intramyocardial delivery of mesenchymal stem cells as a novel therapeutic in patients with heart failure, genomic determinants of patient response to pharmacological therapy, immune cell activation in chronic disease, heart failure outcomes research using the INTERMACS registry, and testing of novel circulatory support devices and other therapeutics in patients with advanced heart failure. The studies are led by multiple investigators, including Prabhu, Salpy Pamboukian, M.D., Jose Tallaj, M.D., Britta Brott, Renzo Loyaga-Rendon, M.D., and Deepak Acharya, M.D. Clinical researchers including Massoud Leesar, M.D., Seun Alli, M.D., and Brott are examining interventional approaches to ischemic and valvular heart disease and associated cardiomyopathy. These include novel strategies for coronary intervention and stent design, outcomes after percutaneous structural (valvular) interventions, and developing paradigms for adjunctive anti-platelet therapy after interventional procedures. Nita Limdi, Ph.D., is leading an institutional precision medicine effort to uncover the clinical impact of genomic variation in the metabolism of anti-platelet drugs after coronary intervention. Hypertension research Hypertension, or high blood pressure, typically has no symptoms, but can have deadly health consequences if not treated. According to the American Heart Association, nearly 80 million U.S. adults have been diagnosed with high blood pressure. Suzanne Oparil, M.D., professor of medicine and past president of the American Heart Association , is part of a groundbreaking study called the SPRINT trial that suggests changing blood pressure guidelines could cause the falling death rate from heart attacks and stroke to drop even more. The trial found that a pressure below 120 was preferable for high-risk patients. A number of hypertension patients are unresponsive to conventional treatment strategies. These individuals, known as resistant hypertensive patients, require three or more anti-hypertension treatments, to help manage their blood pressure. David Calhoun, M.D., professor of medicine in the Division of Cardiovascular Disease, is a pioneer in translational studies designed to identify underlying mechanisms causing resistant hypertension, as well as in the management of this disease. Paul Muntner, vice chair of the UAB Department of Epidemiology in the School of Public Health, recently received a prestigious grant from the American Heart Association to study 24-hour patterns in blood pressure. Blood pressure usually decreases during sleep, an event termed dipping. However, in some individuals, blood pressure does not decrease during the night. This non-dipping event is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The study by Muntner and colleagues Calhoun, Orlando Gutierrez, M.D., Edward Inscho, Ph.D., Oparil, David Pollock, Ph.D., Jennifer Pollock, Ph.D., and Martin Young, Ph.D., is investigating the incidence of non-dipping in distinct racial groups, as well as the potential mechanisms leading to this condition.

A wet, mucus-producing cough may indicate pneumonia or a lung infection. heart complications: Blood flow through the lungs is negatively affected by emphysema and places the heart under increased strain. In time, heart failure may develop. lung cancer: While lung cancer does not develop as a result of emphysema, most emphysema sufferers are smokers, which increases their risk of lung cancer. Why do they say that asthma is copd,this frightens so many people who have never smoked and they feel like they are being branded,and start to feel guilty that they somehow caused this problem Ivanhoe news states; (Ivanhoe Newswire) ? Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, currently has no cure. However, European researchers see potential for a new treatment besides oxygen therapy and breathing techniques. A new study shows the antioxidant protein sestrin activates molecular pathways that cause some of the changes of the lung associated with COPD. Researchers were able to genetically inactivate this protein and improve the elasticity of the lung in a mouse model of emphysema. This suggests that patients of COPD could benefit from a treatment that blocks the sestrin protein, preventing accelerated breakdown of the elastic fibers in the lung.

Greaer, George - Pittsburg George William Greaer, 79, transitioned to his heavenly home on March 23, 2016 at 12:45 p.m. He died peacefully from congestive heart failure at his New Hope home surrounded by caring staff and friends. George was born December 27, 1936 in Nevada, Missouri to Ruth Sheets and George Greaer Sr. Both of his parents have passed. He also had a half-brother, Sonny Daum, who is also deceased. George was a long term resident of New Horizons in Pittsburg and transitioned to New Hope Services, where he happily remained until his passing. George's prize possession was his collection of records and he passed many enjoyable hours listening to a variety of music. He loved to sit on his front porch with his roommates when the weather was nice. His favorite food was liver and onions, with fried chicken and pie running a close second. He never passed up an opportunity to sneak food when his staff wasn't looking. He enjoyed watching wrestling on television. George loved to grow plants and flowers, especially Christmas cactus. When he was physically able, he enjoyed fishing, bowling, and trips with New Hope to places such as Branson, as well as going on a Mexican cruise. George was also a proud recognized Special Olympian. In 2011, he was honored by Special Olympics and was inducted into the Kansas Special Olympics Hall of Fame. This was one of the proudest moments in his life and from then on he served as a true inspiration to all disabled persons. In spite of his disabilities, George worked while he resided at Parsons State Hospital and Training Center, Connections, and New Horizons. He was employed by the Salvation Army from 1993 to 1995. He also participated in valued activities at New Hope as his medically fragile status would allow. An eternal tribute to George's life is the number of people who were fortunate to have known him and shared in his daily life. He could be blustery, stubborn, and cantankerous, which actually made him so loveable to all who knew him. He had an enormous smile and beautiful eyes that would twinkle with laughter. George really depended upon his house manager and staff in his later years. George's long time guardian, Lynda Rybnick, was very active in his life and he cared deeply for her, as she did for him. The romantic love of his life was Georgia Neal, also a New Hope resident. They shared many special occasions over the duration of a 25 year friendship. There was another truly remarkable person in George's life, that saved him from the life of a homeless person, John Lair. A high school student at the time, John noticed that George was always to be found on the same street in Pittsburg every day, obviously with no home. This amazing bond that developed between the two of them lasted and grew over a span of 26 years. George and John loved each other as family. The support and guidance John gave to George made his life worth living versus living the life of a homeless person. Services for George Greaer will be 1:30 p.m. Monday (March 28) at Brenner Mortuary with Rev. Dennis Johnson officiating. Burial will follow at Highland Park Cemetery where he will be laid to rest next to his mother. George, you will remain in the hearts of all at New Hope until we meet again. In lieu of flowers, please make DONATIONS TO New Hope Special Olympics. These may be left at or mailed to the Brenner Mortuary, 114 E. 4th St., Pittsburg, KS 66762.

BLOG,http://knowledgeclass.blogspot.com,http://knowledgeclass.blogspot.com/2016/02/continental-drift.html,2/15/2016,10:48:00,2/15/2016 15:48,Continental Drift,"Even casual inspection of a map of the Southern Hemisphere suggests that the coastlines of eastern South America and western Africa fit together like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. This same thought occurred to the naturalist-explorer Alexander von Humboldt who, during the early 1800s, found similarities between animal and plant fossils in South America and western Africa, and common elements between the mountain ranges in Argentina and South Africa. Subsequent explorers saw similarities between fossils in India and Australia. In 1912, the German geophysicist-meteorologist and polar explorer Alfred Wegener went a step further and proposed that the present continents were once fused into a single landmass, which he called Pangaea (?All-Lands?). Expanding upon this theory in his 1915 book, The Origin of Continents and Oceans, Wegener described how Pangaea subsequently split into two supercontinents, Laurasia (corresponding to the present-day Northern Hemisphere) and Gondwanaland, also called Gondwana (Southern Hemisphere)?an event now thought to have occurred 180 to 200 million years ago. Wegener could not provide an explanation for continental drift, and his concept was roundly rejected until after his death in 1930 from heart failure during an expedition to Greenland. The occurrence of continental drift was finally accepted in the 1960s, when the concept of plate tectonics?involving plates that are in constant motion relative to each other, sliding under other plates and pulling apart?was established. According to the theory of continental drift, a single giant landmass, Pangaea, split into the two supercontinents, Laurasia (Northern Hemisphere) and Gondwana (Southern Hemisphere). Long before continental drift was acknowledged by the scientific community, naturalists were finding ancient fossils of the same or similar plants and animals in continents thousands of miles apart and separated by oceans. Fossil remains of the tropical fern Glossopteris were found in South America, Africa, India, and Australia, while those of the family Kannemeyrid, a mammal-like reptile, were uncovered in Africa, Asia, and South America. By contrast, some living plants and animals on different continents are very different from one another. For example, all the native mammals in Australia are marsupials and not placental mammals, which suggests that Australia split off from Gondwanaland before placental mammals evolved.",0

Epidemiological studies have established these associations, and there are now numerous experimental and clinical studies which have provided information on the possible underlying mechanisms. Mechanistic proof-of-concept studies with surrogate endpoints have been performed to demonstrate that treatment of OSA by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has the potential to reverse or at least to attenuate not only OSA but also the adverse cardiovascular effects associated with OSA. However, no randomized studies have been performed to demonstrate that treatment of OSA by CPAP improves clinical outcomes in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and/or established cardiovascular disease and concomitant OSA. In the present review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of OSA as a potential cardiovascular risk factor, the impact of OSA on cardiac function, the role of OSA as a modifier of the course of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, and the insights from studies evaluating the impact of CPAP therapy on the cardiovascular features associated with OSA.

If you have a family history of heart disease, then you are at increased risk yourself. However, there is plenty you can do to decrease your risk whether you have a family tendency or not. Here are some proven changes you can start making today to reduce your risk of heart problems in the future... When it comes to keeping your heart as healthy as possible, there are some factors, such as genetics that you can?t change. If you have a family history of heart disease, then you are at increased risk yourself. Here, we reveal eight steps everyone can take to lower their risk 1. QUIT YOUR HABIT The obvious one is to stop smoking. Smokers die on average 10 years earlier than non-smokers as shown in a study of a million UK women published last year. If you can stop smoking before you are 40, you are 10 times less likely to have health problems than if you continue. As well as benefiting your heart, you will see rapid improvements in your breathing, mood and reduce your risk of stroke, diabetes, cancer, circulation problems and numerous other problems. WATCH YOUR WEIGHT The association between heart disease and being overweight is extremely strong ? not least because obesity puts you at risk of type 2 diabetes which, in itself, increases the risk of heart disease and multiple other conditions. If you carry more weight around your waist than your hips you are even more at risk. To calculate your waist to hip ratio, divide your waist measurement by your hip measurement. A high ratio (over 0.85 for women or 1 for men) means increased risk of health problems such as heart attacks, high blood pressure or diabetes, even if you aren?t that overweight. The link between heart disease and weight is extremely strong - not least because obesity increases a person's risk of type 2 diabetes which in itself increases the risk of heart disease 3. IS FAT-FREE BEST? You have probably been advised to cut out saturated fats and replace butter with unsaturated fat spreads. This is because a diet high in saturated fats is thought to be one factor that leads to high levels of bad cholesterol in the blood, which in turn may cause narrowing of the arteries and heart attacks. However, there is now some controversy as to whether these dietary changes make much difference to your risk of heart disease. A recent overview of multiple studies found no evidence that restricting saturated fat and increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption lowered the risk of developing heart disease. The jury is still out on this one, and it shouldn?t be used as an excuse to eat high fat doughnuts, pastries, chips and other sources of processed, saturated fat. However, butter, cheese and cream in small quantities may not be the complete villains they were thought to be. 4. SAY BYE-BYE TO BACON Reducing the amount of red meat is recommended as studies have shown that eating a large amount can increase heart failure by up to 24 per cent. However, recent evidence suggests that this is linked more to red meat that is processed (we?re talking ham, salami, sausages, bacon etc) ? with no definite association shown with the consumption of unprocessed red meat. The researchers calculated that for each 50g of processed meat eaten per day (about one or two extra slices of ham) the risk of heart failure increased by eight per cent and the risk of death by 38 per cent. These results require confirmation with further studies but as processing can increase the risk of stomach disease too, it seems sensible to limit processed red meat wherever possible. Reducing the amount of red meat is recommended as studies have shown eating large quantities can increase heart failure by up to 24 per cent. But recent evidence suggests this link is more pertinent with processed meats, such as bacon, salami, sausages and ham 5. EAT LESS SALT The British Heart Foundation is clear that too much salt can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease later in life. Adults should have less than six grams (one teaspoon) a day. Cutting back on salt doesn?t just mean keeping your hands away from the salt cellar when you are eating, there is also a lot of hidden salt in processed food. Check the labels and cook from scratch wherever possible ? then you are in control. 6. SAY NO TO SUGAR A large population study in the United States showed that people who consumed more than 25 per cent of their daily calories from added sugar had an almost three times higher risk of dying from heart disease than those who had less than 10 per cent, independent of other risk factors including weight. More and more evidence suggests that too much sugar is contributing to the obesity and diabetes epidemic too, and as it offers no nutrients whatsoever, it is time to cut back. Gradually reduce the sugar you add to your food or drinks, avoid fizzy drinks and look carefully at labels ? you will be amazed at how much sugar is added to all sorts of food, both sweet and savoury. A study in the US showed people who consume more than 25 per cent of their daily calories from added sugar had an almost three times higher risk of dying from heart disease than those who had less than 10 per cent of calories from added sugar 7. KEEP ACTIVE Don?t despair if you are a couch potato ? it?s never too late to start. As well as helping with that weight loss, a recent study showed that you could get the same heart health benefits if starting exercise such as running or cycling after 40, as you would have done if you had started before the age of 30. There are numerous other benefits from exercise too?what are you waiting for?! 8. STRESS LESS And finally, while you should be aware of keeping your heart healthy, don?t let it stress you out as stress doesn?t help your heart either. The stress hormone, ?cortisol? can increase unhealthy fat around the middle, raising your risk of heart problems, as well as leading to cravings for high fat and sugar foods, which only make things worse. So, for a healthy and happy heart, start making a few small changes today ? your heart will love you forever. It is vital to keep active if you want to sustain good heart health, but couch potatoes do not have to despair, for it is never too late to start, studies suggest. Recent evidence shows you get the same heart health benefits of starting exercise after 40, as you would have done had you started in your 30s",0

The mountain, which is found in northern Tanzania, has continued to be a popular tourist destination over the years. The mountain is a major challenge to conquer and requires adequate mental and physical preparation. To increase the chances of succeeding, you need to start training for Kilimanjaro early (at least two months before the hike). The type of physical routine that you get involved in should help you build cardiovascular endurance and your muscle strength. Weight training helps you improve your performance and helps protect joints such as the ankles, knees and the spine which tend to be strained when hiking. Your target should be to carry a backpack of about 20 pounds as you take a flight of stairs at a rate of 30 steps a minute. The amount of training that is required greatly depends on your initial fitness level. Persons that have not hiked before will, on average, require a longer duration of physical exercise than those that hike regularly. Beginners are advised to start by walking outdoors for short distances (such as a mile) and increasing the gradually to say, four or five miles. Take stairs as often as possible. It is important that you keep consulting with your doctor to ensure that you remain medically fit. The doctor will subject you to a full checkup to find out if you have any diseases that would make it difficult for you to go for the hike. Some of the conditions that may be a cause for concern include metabolic disorders such as diabetes, chronic respiratory conditions (such as asthma) and cardiovascular disorders such as heart failure and hypotension. Apart from being physically fit you need to also prepare your body physiologically. At high altitude the air is thinner and oxygen supply is markedly reduced. High altitude training helps your body to pre-acclimatize so that you can cope with such strenuous conditions. The best way of achieving this is to be involved in several shorter hiking exercises regularly. This can be easily done within Tanzania where there are a number of smaller mountains near Kilimanjaro to be used for practice. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced climber, you need to arrive a few days earlier. This will help you relax and shake off the jet lag. At the same time, it will give you an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the local climate and food. There is at least a 5% chance of making it to the peak if you arrive in good time. You need to carry with you a number of essential items. The technical clothing will typically include hiking pants, a long sleeved shirt, a waterproof jacket (with a hood), a pair of gloves and sports bra (for women). Important equipment specific to the exercise include a map, a compass (or GPS), sleeping bags and headlamps among others. Other accessories include a towel, toilet paper, soap and so on. Persons that are traveling to Tanzania need to ensure that they have the proper documentation that will allow them enter the country. Visa requirements apply to most countries outside the Commonwealth. Ensure that you find out in advance what is required for your specific case. It would be unfortunate to miss out on the opportunity after weeks of preparations.

Yet the amount of black on white murders and white on black murders is less than about 500 per year. So if your white and afraid of being murdered by black people, you're an idiot.

Two strangers met for the first time, but they will always share a special bond. Three years ago, Orrin Reed of Candia, N.H. contracted a virus that permanently damaged his heart. Six years ago, Delphine Andrews of Randolph developed heart failure that runs in her family. Both were on the transplant list and both received the call. Reed says when his wife came into the room and said the transplant doctor was on the phone he felt like he was going to be sick with excitement. ?I thought I was going to throw up,? he admits.

Abstract The treatment of acute thromboembolic limb ischemia includes well-established surgical thrombectomy procedures and, in recent times, also percutaneous rotational thrombectomy using Straub Rotarex? system. This modality not only enables efficient treatment of such thrombotic occlusion but also in rare cases may imply the risk of perforation of the occluded artery. Herein, we report the case of a perforation of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) in an elderly female patient with thromboembolic limb ischemia. The perforation was successfully treated by implantation of self-expanding nitinol Supera stents and without the need for implantation of a stent graft. 1. Introduction Peripheral artery disease (PAD) exhibits increasing morbidity and mortality during the last few decades [ 1 ] and is estimated to affect over 200 million people worldwide, including up to 30% of elderly primary care individuals [ 2 , 3 ]. Patients with symptomatic PAD exhibit a life expectancy of 80% within 5 years of follow-up [ 4 , 5 ], whereas patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) show significant poorer outcomes with amputation and death rates of 15?20% and 25%, respectively, within the first year after diagnosis [ 6 ]. Especially patients with acute thromboembolic limb ischemia are in high risk of major amputation and death due to sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction. Such patients are usually older than 75 years and show further comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation and history of heart failure [ 7 ]. The treatment of this limb- and life-threatening condition includes well-established surgical thrombectomy procedures and, in recent times, also percutaneous rotational thrombectomy procedures using Straub Rotarex system, if required in combination with local thrombolysis [ 8 ]. This method enables quick and efficient treatment of peripheral arterial thromboembolic occlusion. Despite the low complication rate of rotational thrombectomy, perforations of the occluded artery have been reported previously. Herein, we report the case of a perforation of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) in an elderly female patient with thromboembolic limb ischemia, which was successfully treated by implantation of self-expanding nitinol Supera stents. 2. Case Presentation An 85-year-old female patient was referred to our department with new onset of severe pain, paleness, and pulselessness of her left leg since 12 hours. Duplex-sonography revealed thrombotic occlusion of the left common femoral artery (CFA) (Figure 1 ) and the patient was immediately scheduled for digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The patient had history of arterial hypertension and heart failure but no history of clinically evident PAD. DSA confirmed the thrombotic occlusion of the CFA (Figure 2(a) ), and interventional treatment was initiated after injection of 500?mg aspirin and 5,000?I.U. of heparin. After insertion of an 0.018?? guide wire, Rotarex catheter (ab medica GmbH, DÅsseldorf, Germany) thrombectomy was performed in the CFA and in the proximal superficial femoral artery (SFA) (Figure 2(b) ), resulting in antegrade flow in both SFA, but with high remaining thrombotic burden in the CFA (Figures 2(c) and 2(d) ). After repeated Rotarex catheter thrombectomy a perforation of the SFA was noticed, which persisted despite prolonged inflation using a ?mm balloon (Figures 2(e) ? 2(g) ). Due to persistent perforation, the implantation of 2 overlapping ?mm nitinol Supera stents (Abbott Vascular, Illinois, USA) was performed, which resulted in complete repair of the vascular injury of the SFA (Figures 2(h) and 2(i) ). Local lysis was subsequently performed due to high remaining thrombotic burden of the CFA, using 10?mg bolus injection of Actilyse? (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany) and continuous infusion of 1?mg/h for further 16 hours. Repeated DSA was scheduled for the next day. In the mean time, pain symptoms of the patient improved, whereas she recovered from paleness of the lower limb except for the area of her distal foot. The next day, DSA revealed complete resolution of the thrombus in the CFA (Figure 3(a) ). However, reocclusion of the SFA was unfortunately noticed (Figure 3(a) , orange arrow), requiring repeated Rotarex catheter thrombectomy and implantation of 2 further self-expanding nitinol Innova ? stents (?mm and ?mm, Boston Scientific, Ratingen, Germany) in the SFA (Figure 3(b) ). Subsequently, good angiographic flow was shown in the SFA and in the popliteal artery with a 1-vessel run-off of the anterior tibial artery (Figures 3(c) ? 3(f) ). After the second angiographic procedure pain symptoms and limb paleness and paresthesia were completely resolved. In addition, holter monitoring revealed the presence of atrial fibrillation and the patient was put on treatment with aspirin (100?mg daily), clopidogrel (75?mg daily), and 5?mg subcutaneous FXa-inhibitor fondaparinux for 4 weeks. Ambulatory Duplex-sonography at 4 weeks of follow-up demonstrated a good triphasic flow pattern in the SFA (Figure 4 ) and the patient was put on treatment with coumadin. Figure 1: Thrombotic occlusion of the left common femoral artery (CFA). Absence of flow can be appreciated in the distal part of the vessel, associated with thrombus formation (red arrows). The origin of a collateral artery can be depicted proximally to the vessel occlusion (yellow arrow). Figure 2: Occlusion of the CFA is noticed by DSA (a). Rotarex catheter thrombectomy reestablishes antegrade flow in the CFA and SFA (b), but thrombotic burden remains high as it can be appreciated by the orange arrows in (c). Mid and distal parts of the SFA with thrombus formations can also be appreciated in (d). After repeated Rotarex thrombectomy a perforation of the SFA is noticed, with persistent despite prolonged balloon inflation (orange arrows in (e)?(g)). Subsequently, 2 overlapping nitinol Supera stents are implanted (h), resulting in complete cessation of the bleeding complication (orange arrow in (i)). Figure 3: During the second angiographic session, DSA reveals not only complete resolution of the thrombus in the CFA (a) but also reocclusion of the SFA (orange arrow in (a)), requiring repeated Rotarex thrombectomy and implantation of further self-expanding nitinol stents (b). Subsequently, good angiographic flow can be achieved in the SFA and in the popliteal artery with a 1-vessel run-off of the anterior tibial artery ((c)?(f)). Figure 4: Triphasic flow in the SFA at 4 weeks of follow-up. 3. Discussion To the best of our knowledge this is the first case reporting the placement of self-expanding nitinol Supera stent for the management of a perforation in a peripheral artery. In the past decades, significant technical developments have occurred with endovascular therapy of acute thromboembolism, which offer several advantages over open surgical embolectomy techniques for the treatment of peripheral arterial thromboembolic occlusion [ 8 ]. Although the Straub Rotarex system is widely available and well established for the treatment of such thrombotic lesions, perforations of the occluded artery have been described previously and in our case. In such cases, usually stent grafts are employed. However, such stent grafts are expensive and are usually deliverable using ?8F sheaths. This may require an additional arterial puncture under full anticoagulation or lead to additional time spent for changing the arterial sheath, which may aggravate bleeding complications. In our case, the SFA perforation could be successfully treated using self-expanding nitinol Supera stents, which are deliverable using a 6F sheath. 4. Conclusion Herein we report the placement of a self-expanding nitinol Supera stent for the management of a perforation in a peripheral superficial femoral artery. Further novel options of complication management as described in our case may shift the treatment from surgical to even more endovascular treatment procedures in the future.

Int J Cardiol. 2016 Feb 2;209:153-160 Authors: Armeni P, Boscolo PR, Tarricone R, Capodanno D, Maggioni AP, Grasso C, Tamburino C, Maisano F Abstract BACKGROUND: We evaluated the real-world cost-effectiveness of the MitraClip system (Abbott Vascular Inc., Menlo Park, CA) plus medical therapy for patients with moderate/severe mitral regurgitation, as compared with medical therapy (MT) alone. METHODS: Clinical records of patients with moderate to severe functional mitral regurgitation treated with MitraClip (N=232) or with MT (N=151) were collected and outcome analyzed with propensity score adjustment to reduce selection bias. Twelve-month outcomes were modeled over a lifetime horizon to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis, in the payer?s perspective. Costs and benefits were discounted at an annual rate of 3.5%. RESULTS: After propensity score adjustment, the average treatment effect was -9.5% probability of dying at 12months and, following lifetime modeling, 3.35?0.75 incremental life years and 3.01?0.57 incremental quality-adjusted life years. MitraClip contributed to a higher decrease in re-hospitalizations at 12months (difference=-0.54?0.08) and generated a more likely improvement in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class at 12months versus NYHA at enrollment. Incremental costs, adapted to five possible scenarios, ranged from 14,493 to 29,795 ? contributing to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranging from 4796 to 7908 ?. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to MT alone and given conventional threshold values, MitraClip can be considered a cost-effective procedure. The cost-effectiveness of MitraClip is in line or superior to the one of other non-pharmaceutical strategies for heart failure. PMID: 26894467 [PubMed ? as supplied by publisher]",0

Programs at Vanderbilt and Aurora St. Luke?s Medical Center join the initiative in care of ?the other high blood pressure.? Silver Spring, Md. (PRWEB) March 30, 2016 The Pulmonary Hypertension Association (PHA) has announced two newly accredited Centers of Comprehensive Care (CCC) as part of the Pulmonary Hypertension Care Centers (PHCC) initiative. Now found in 23 states in the contiguous United States, increased numbers of CCCs provide more options for adult and pediatric patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH is increased pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs that can lead to death from right heart failure. Common symptoms of PH can include shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain. The disease is often misdiagnosed and treated as another illness, such as asthma or COPD. Delays in diagnosis and treatment cost patients valuable time. Because patients go months, sometimes years, believing they have something other than PH, the average length of survival for the progressive disease is only 2.8 years after diagnosis. However, the good news is that with early and accurate diagnosis, PH treatments extend and improve the quality of life for many patients. The PHCC initiative is designed to create an accreditation program to raise the level of care for patients living with PH. Criteria are based on key measures of care for PH patients, including the program?s overall commitment to PH patients, scope of services provided and expertise of care team. The two newly accredited CCCs are: 1. Vanderbilt Pulmonary Vascular Center ? Nashville, Tenn.2. Pulmonary Hypertension Clinic at Aurora St. Luke?s Medical Center ? Milwaukee, Wis. The PHCC program helps to advance PHA?s mission of extending and improving the lives of people living with PH. Anticipated outcomes of the PHCC initiative include better informed patients and medical professionals, improved access to Centers with expertise in PH, and increased opportunities for research collaboration between Centers. PHA?s Scientific Leadership Council (SLC) and the PHCC Oversight Committee set the criteria for PHCC accreditation. The SLC is composed of global leaders in the field of pulmonary hypertension including healthcare professionals and research scientists in medical centers recognized for excellence in care for patients with PH. Since the launch of the PHA-accredited PH Care Center (PHCC) program, a total of 34 Center of Comprehensive Care (CCC) programs have been accredited, including 30 adult centers and four pediatric centers. As Centers are accredited, they also agree to contribute to the Pulmonary Hypertension Association Registry (PHAR). This patient registry will collect data used to evaluate outcomes for people living with PH and help researchers learn more about the rare disease, leading to the possibility for new breakthroughs in treatment and quality of care. For more information on PHCC, go to http://www.PHCareCenters.org or email PHCC@PHAssociation.org. About the Pulmonary Hypertension Association: Headquartered in Silver Spring, Md., with a growing list of chapters across the country, the Pulmonary Hypertension Association (PHA) is the country?s leading pulmonary hypertension organization. Its mission is to extend and improve the lives of those affected by PH; its vision is a world without PH, empowered by hope. PHA achieves this by connecting and working together with the entire PH community of patients, families and medical professionals. Among its programs, PHA facilitates more than 245 support groups around the country and delivers continuing education for medical professionals through PHA Online University. Now celebrating its 25th anniversary, PHA has provided more than $17 million in PH research commitments.

Researchers have found that when mice are exposed to chronic, ongoing stress, their lymphatic systems undergo physical changes that make it quicker and easier for cancer to spread throughout their bodies. And if you have cancer, stress is an understatement. Doctors have a drug that seems to stop this activity and are testing it now on breast cancer patients. But seeing how stress physically helps tumors progress should be a big wake-up call about how strongly stress may impact other diseases or areas of your health. Scientists already knew that stress hormones could increase blood vessel formation, giving cancerous cells more potential escape routes, but until now it wasn?t clear whether they also influenced the lymphatic system. To test that theory, mice were restrained to create stress. The researchers found that the stressed-out mice had a higher rate of cancer spreading than their relaxed peers, and were able to show that this was because the stress hormone adrenaline was activating the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) to amp up the rate of lymph formation. Not only that, the stress hormone actually physically changed the lymph vessels draining out of tumours, allowing cancerous cells to escape to other parts of the body faster. ?So not only do you get new freeways out of the tumor but the speed limit is increased and so the tumor cells can flow out of the tumor much more rapidly,? said Erica Sloan from Monash University in Australia. The drug that holds promise at slowing spread of cancer from stress is a beta blocker known as propranolol. ?When tracked over about seven years, it turned out that those that had been taking beta-blockers also showed far less evidence of tumor cells moving into the lymph nodes and then disseminating to other organs like the lung, so it provides clinical support for what we see in the mice,? Sloan told ABC. There are concerns that some beta-blockers can cause and worsen heart problems, even congestive heart failure. 1 A decision to use this medication would need to be carefully considered by patient and doctor. Healthy ways to handle stress Because we are learning more about the physical affects of stress on disease, health and our bodies through research, it may be time to change how we perceive stress. For many people it?s a minor annoyance. For others, like those suffering with cancer, it?s a huge burden. And learning how to handle stress in a healthier way is best done when it doesn?t have such a stronghold on you. Breathing exercises have been used for centuries by Indian yogis to calm the mind, relax the body and restore health. Adopting this daily practice that just takes minutes a day could have positive health benefits that extend from peace of mind to possibly disease preventing.

Our bodies have evolved to move, yet we now use the energy in oil instead of muscles to do our work.? ? David Suzuki, Canadian academic, science broadcaster and environmental activist IT'S BEEN almost three weeks since Paul was taken my ambulance to Mercy Hospital's ER with his heart pounding erratically, and two weeks to the day that he was released from the hospital after having a catheter ablation to correct atrial flutter. (Click on this link to read that story.) It's been an up and down journey since. Paul had a procedural followup appointment Monday of this week. Between the ablation and this appointment, he'd had a couple of bad spells ? although nothing even remotely close to that which took him to the ER in the first place, but concerning nonetheless. We learned from Craig Hoffman, the physician's assistant who saw Paul, that flutter ablation is about 95% to 98% effective. Naturally we're hoping that Paul isn't in the 3% to 5% for whom it's ineffective. If the flutter procedure has been successful, then what he's experiencing when his heart is misbehaving is probably atrial fibrillation, but he's on a medication for that, so after thorough discussion, we collectively decided Paul should wear a heart monitor for a couple of days to make sure there's no flutter and see how frequent and how severe the fibrillation is. We learned, however, that there's a third component in the mix: sleep apnea (also know as obstructive sleep apnea). Wow, was I ever ignorant about this condition! Previously I thought, ""Well sure you don't want to stop breathing altogether when you're sleeping, but if it's just a little pause that always passes, no harm, no foul."" Wrong. (At the bottom, I've included an article from the National Institutes of Health National Heart, Lund and Blood Institute explaining what sleep apnea is and the dangers it poses.) So Paul is going to have a sleep study done in the next few weeks. We'll figure out what to do from there. What Is Sleep Apnea? Sleep apnea is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour. Typically, normal breathing then starts again, sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound. Sleep apnea usually is a chronic (ongoing) condition that disrupts your sleep. When your breathing pauses or becomes shallow, you?ll often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep. As a result, the quality of your sleep is poor, which makes you tired during the day. Sleep apnea is a leading cause of excessive daytime sleepiness. Overview Sleep apnea often goes undiagnosed. Doctors usually can't detect the condition during routine office visits. Also, no blood test can help diagnose the condition. Most people who have sleep apnea don't know they have it because it only occurs during sleep. A family member or bed partner might be the first to notice signs of sleep apnea. The most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea. In this condition, the airway collapses or becomes blocked during sleep. This causes shallow breathing or breathing pauses. When you try to breathe, any air that squeezes past the blockage can cause loud snoring. Obstructive sleep apnea is more common in people who are overweight, but it can affect anyone. For example, small children who have enlarged tonsil tissues in their throats may have obstructive sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea is a less common type of sleep apnea. This disorder occurs if the area of your brain that controls your breathing doesn't send the correct signals to your breathing muscles. As a result, you'll make no effort to breathe for brief periods. Central sleep apnea can affect anyone. However, it's more common in people who have certain medical conditions or use certain medicines. Central sleep apnea can occur with obstructive sleep apnea or alone. Snoring typically doesn't happen with central sleep apnea. This article mainly focuses on obstructive sleep apnea. Untreated sleep apnea can: ? Increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, obesity, and diabetes ? Increase the risk of, or worsen, heart failure ? Make arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), or irregular heartbeats, more likely ? Increase the chance of having work-related or driving accidents (Note from me: Other research indicates that sleep apnea can also damage the brain. The below excerpt is from The Sleep Foundation.) Researchers have found yet another reason why people with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) should get tested and treated for the disease. According to a recent study published in the journal SLEEP, patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome demonstrated reduced brain gray matter concentration. (Gray matter refers to the cerebral cortex, where most information processing in the brain takes place.) And here from WebMD is how OSA causes or is correlated to increased risks. Here are seven health problems you might face if you have OSA: 1. High blood pressure. If you already have it, obstructive sleep apnea can make it worse. Waking up often during the night can cause your hormone systems to go into overdrive, which boosts your blood pressure levels. When you can?t breathe well in your sleep, the level of oxygen in your blood drops, which may add to the problem. Treatment does make a difference, though. Some people with high BP who get help for sleep apnea can cut back on their blood pressure medications. 2. Heart disease. People with OSA are more likely to have heart attacks. The causes may be low oxygen or the stress of waking up often. Stroke and atrial fibrillation ? a problem with the rhythm of your heartbeat -- are also linked with the condition. Sleep apnea disrupts how your body takes in oxygen, which makes it hard for your brain to control how blood flows in your arteries and the brain itself. 3. Type 2 diabetes. Sleep apnea is common among people with this condition -- up to 80% of them have OSA. Obesity raises a person?s risk for both disorders. Although studies haven?t shown a clear link between sleep apnea and type 2 diabetes, not getting enough shut-eye can keep your body from using insulin properly, which leads to diabetes. 4. Weight gain. Extra pounds raise your chances of getting sleep apnea, and the condition also makes it harder to slim down. When you?re overweight, you can have fatty deposits in your neck that block breathing at night. On the flip side, sleep apnea can make your body release more of the hormone ghrelin, which makes you crave carbs and sweets. And when you're tired all the time, you might not be able to turn the food you eat into energy as efficiently, which can lead to weight gain. 2. Heart disease.

Science hasn?t proven a link to OSA, but people who get sleep apnea treatment may find they have fewer asthma attacks. 6. Acid reflux. There?s no proof that sleep apnea causes this kind of heartburn that doesn?t get better, but many people say that it?s a problem. Treating it seems to improve apnea symptoms, sleep doctors say. 7. Car accidents. When you feel groggy, that can raise your risk of falling asleep at the wheel. People with sleep apnea are up to five times more likely than normal sleepers to have traffic accidents.",0

Clinicians can try evidence-based protocols for treating tobacco users or customize their own Million Hearts? Tobacco Cessation Protocol [PDF-432KB] template. What Is Heart Disease and Stroke? Heart disease and stroke are cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) diseases (CVDs).1 Heart disease includes several types of heart conditions. The most common type in the United States is coronary heart disease (also known as coronary artery disease), which is narrowing of the blood vessels that carry blood to the heart.2,3 This can cause: Chest pain2 Heart attack (when blood flow to the heart becomes blocked and a section of the heart muscle is damaged or dies)2,4 Heart failure (when the heart cannot pump enough blood and oxygen to support other organs)2,5 Arrhythmia (when the heart beats too fast, too slow, or irregularly)2,6 A stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is blocked or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, causing brain tissue to die.7 Stroke can cause disability (such as paralysis, muscle weakness, trouble speaking, memory loss)8 or death. Top of Page How Are Smoking Related to Heart Disease and Stroke? Smoking is a major cause of CVD and causes one of every three deaths from CVD.9 Smoking can:10 Raise triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood) Lower """"good"""" cholesterol (HDL) Make blood sticky and more likely to clot, which can block blood flow to the heart and brain Damage cells that line the blood vessels Increase the buildup of plaque (fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances) in blood vessels Cause thickening and narrowing of blood vessels Top of Page How Is Breathing Secondhand Smoke Related to Heart Disease and Stroke? Breathing secondhand smoke also harms your health. Secondhand smoke is the smoke from burning tobacco products.9,11,12 Secondhand smoke also is smoke breathed out by a smoker.11,12 Breathing secondhand smoke can cause coronary heart disease, including heart attack and stroke.9,11,13 Know the facts:9 Secondhand smoke causes nearly 34,000 early deaths from coronary heart disease each year in the United States among nonsmokers. Nonsmokers who breathe secondhand smoke at home or at work increase their risk of developing heart disease by 25?30%. Secondhand smoke increases the risk for stroke by 20?30%. Each year, secondhand smoke exposure causes more than 8,000 deaths from stroke. Breathing secondhand smoke interferes with the normal functioning of the heart, blood, and vascular systems in ways that increase your risk of having a heart attack. Even briefly breathing secondhand smoke can damage the lining of blood vessels and cause your blood to become stickier. These changes can cause a deadly heart attack. Top of Page How Can Heart Disease and Stroke Be Prevented? Heart disease and stroke are major causes of death and disability in the United States. Many people are at high risk for these diseases and don't know it. The good news is that many risk factors for heart disease and stroke can be prevented or controlled. The federal government?s Million Hearts? initiative aims to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. It?s important to know your risk for heart disease and stroke and to take action to reduce that risk. A good place to start is with the ABCS of heart health:14 Aspirin: Aspirin may help reduce your risk for heart disease and stroke. But do not take aspirin if you think you are having a stroke. It can make some types of stroke worse. Before taking aspirin, talk to your doctor about whether aspirin is right for you. Blood pressure: Control your blood pressure. Cholesterol: Manage your cholesterol. Smoking: Quit smoking, or don?t start. In addition to your ABCS, several lifestyle choices can help protect your heart and brain health. These include the following:13,14 Avoid breathing secondhand smoke. Eat low-fat, low-salt foods most of the time and fresh fruits and vegetables. Maintain a healthy weight. Exercise regularly. Limit alcohol use. Get other health conditions (such as diabetes) under control. Top of Page Additional Resources Brian, one of the 2016 Tips campaign participants, had a heart attack at age 35.

A retrospective review of records for 20 consecutive patients presenting with MAC at the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, found global systolic dysfunction in 14 patients and a ?reverse Takotsubo? pattern in the remaining six. The reverse Takotsubo patients were nearly all female, had a short history of abuse of either ?ice? or ?speed? and relatively high troponin-I and creatine kinase levels. These patients all had normalisation of systolic function within 6 weeks. But patients with global systolic dysfunction did not fare so well, with only two of the 14 having normalisation of their left ventricular ejection fraction on follow up echocardiography. The six patients presenting with the reverse Takotsubo pattern ?is the largest group reported [with this pattern] in the literature to date,? say the authors, led by Professor David Kaye. The study is also the first to find evidence of mid-wall fibrosis in humans abusing methamphetamines, in two thirds of nine global systolic dysfunction patients who underwent cardiac MRI. ?One may postulate that methamphetamine abuse elicits a heterogeneous response, with some patients developing a chronic fibrotic process, while others present with an acute stress (?Reverse Takotsubo?) cardiomyopathy, the authors say.

Surprisingly, the increased risk of heart failure was found in men who were within the normal body weight range (a body mass index of 18.5 to 25) in adolescence, with an increased risk starting in those with a BMI of 20 and rising steeply to a nearly ten-fold increased risk in those who were very obese, with a BMI of 35 or over.Research that followed more than 1.6 million Swedish men from adolescence onwards between 1968 and 2005 has shown that those who were overweight as teenagers were more likely to develop heart failure in early middle age. Surprisingly, the increased risk of heart failure was found in men who were within the normal body weight range (a body mass index of 18.5 to 25) in adolescence, with an increased risk starting in those with a BMI of 20 and rising steeply to a nearly ten-fold increased risk in those who were very obese, with a BMI of 35 or over. The study, which is published today (Friday) in the European Heart Journal [1], found that in men with a BMI of 20 and over, the risk of heart failure increased by 16% with every BMI unit, after adjustments for factors that could affect the findings, such as age, year of enlistment into the Swedish armed forces, other diseases, parental education, blood pressure, IQ, muscle strength and fitness. Annika Rosengren, Professor of Medicine at the Sahlgrenska Academy (Gothenburg, Sweden), who led the research, said: ""Although most studies define a normal weight as having a BMI between 18.5 and 25, this is probably not an appropriate definition in the young, most of whom are naturally thin. This may be why we see an increase in the risk of heart failure starting at a fairly low BMI level. However, it was surprising to see the very steep increase in risk with increasing body weight above a BMI of 20. ""Given the global trend for growing numbers of teenagers to be overweight and obese, our findings suggest that heart failure, which in this study occurred at the relatively early average age of about 47 may well become a major threat to health worldwide. This serves to underline the urgent need for action worldwide to curb the obesity epidemic. Action needs to be taken by governments as well as by individuals, for instance by creating an environment that does not promote overweight and obesity, and that encourages people not to be sedentary and not to eat more than they need. This is more important than hassling people into dieting whatever shape they are. Once established, overweight and obesity is much harder to tackle."" Until recently, Swedish law required all 18-year-old Swedish men to enlist in the armed forces, and between 1968 and 2005 a total of 1,810,348 men enlisted and underwent standardised physical and cognitive examinations. For this study Professor Rosengren and her colleagues analysed data on 1,610,437 men from the Swedish Conscript registry. They followed the men from the time they enlisted at 18, for between five to 42 years (an average follow-up time of 23 years). During that time, 5,492 men were admitted to hospital for heart failure, with an average age at diagnosis of nearly 47. Compared with men who had a BMI of between 18.5 and 20 at the time of conscription, men with a BMI of 20 to 22.5 had a 22% increased risk of heart failure, after adjusting for factors that could affect the results. The risk nearly doubled for those with a BMI between 22.5 and 25, and more than tripled for those with a BMI between 25 and 27.5. The risk increased more than six-fold for those classified as obese with a BMI between 30-35, and was nearly 10-fold for the very obese with a BMI of 35 or more. The researchers say their findings suggest that preventive action needs to be taken earlier in life. Prof Rosengren said: ""Current prevention guidelines are meant to guide doctors treating patients with factors that may put them at increased risk of heart and blood vessel problems within the next decade or so. The overwhelming majority of young people have an extremely low risk of any such problems and so are not in need of preventive measures on an individual basis, except for firm anti-smoking advice. However, our findings show the importance of body weight in adolescence and suggest that more emphasis should be placed on the maintenance of a healthy body weight from an early age as a preventive measure."" The researchers point out that limitations to the study include the fact that their findings are only applicable to men and that, overall, women have a lower risk of heart failure than men; nor did they have any information on weight gain after the men were conscripted at 18, so that a slightly greater weight at 18, might be an indicator of an increased risk of subsequently becoming overweight or obese, which in itself, would be a risk factor for heart failure. However, the strength of the study is its large size, with over 1.6 million participants.",0

Taking steps to recover from depression and boost vitamin D levels may improve heart health, according to new research out Saturday. The findings were contained in two studies presented at the American College of Cardiology conference in Chicago. The first focused on depression, a known risk factor for heart attack, stroke and even death. Researchers at the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Salt Lake City studied a registry of more than 7,500 people, and found when depressed patients get effective treatment, they can lower their risk of heart damage to the same level as a person who never suffered from depression. ?Our study shows that prompt, effective treatment of depression appears to improve the risk of poor heart health,? said Heidi May, a cardiovascular epidemiologist with the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute. However, those who remained depressed had higher rates of heart problems ? at a rate of about six percent, compared to around four percent of people without depression. ?The key conclusion of our study is: If depression isn?t treated, the risk of cardiovascular complications increases significantly,? May said. A second study, also led by May, focused on two measures of vitamin D, which when too low can predict the likelihood of heart attack, stroke, heart failure or death. Some 4,200 people aged 52 to 76 were studied. Most already had coronary artery disease (70 percent) and one quarter were diabetic. For doctors who treat these patients, the most important measures of vitamin D are known as total vitamin D and bioavailable vitamin D, since both were ?the most accurate in predicting harmful cardiovascular events,? said the findings. ?Our study found that low levels of both total vitamin D and bioavailable vitamin D appear to be associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes,? said May. ?And evaluating usable vitamin D could mean the difference on the amount of vitamin D prescribed, if it?s prescribed at all.? May added that more research was needed to examine Caucasian and African-American patients, since these groups are known to be affected differently by vitamin D. source: technology.inquirer.net",0

During the induction phase of a Ketogenic Diet, most people experience a horrid ?flu? that often makes people believe from the start that it isn?t right for our bodies. Consider it the first of your many trials to come. The flu is a manifestation of your mental and physical dependence on carbohydrates and the body is essentially going through a phase where it has to learn to use fat as fuel. Keto flu can be treated by replenishing your electrolytes. (See next section.) The flu-like symptoms should dissipate in a few days or weeks. But be warned: For as long as you eat low-carb, if you don?t take care to get enough sodium, potassium and magnesium (a.k.a. electrolytes) in your diet, you may experience fatigue, muscle twitching, headaches, muscle cramping, and in severe cases, arrhythmia. Leg cramps may be the most common sign that your electrolytes are out of balance. How do I replenish electrolytes? Even if you go out of your way to eat lots of table salt and foods containing potassium and magnesium, you may find you need to take supplements. The minimum daily intake for the three electrolytes is given by Lyle McDonald as: 5000 mg of sodium (salt)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride) 1000 mg of potassium, in the form of potassium chloride or potassium sulfate 300 mg of magnesium You can track the intake of these minerals with a tool such as myfitnesspal.com. Most of us will not reach these suggested totals with food alone, but there are several ways to ingest extra electrolytes: Drink 1 or 2 cups of bouillon or broth daily Measure salt and/or salt substitute to add to your food over the course of the day. Take a multivitamin containing magnesium and/or potassium Take a magnesium supplement. Use salt or salt substitute to meet the minimum daily intake, over the course of the day. Don't take large amounts, e.g. >250mg of salt substitute (potassium) at once to avoid adverse effects. Spread it out over the day instead. Potassium supplements in capsule/tablet form are limited to 99mg per dose for safety and convenience. Note: Unfortunately, many potassium-rich foods are not keto-friendly. For example, don?t eat bananas unless you want to get knocked out of keto. Several companies make low-sodium salt substitutes (LoSalt, Lite Salt, AlsoSalt, etc.) for people trying to reduce their sodium intake. Luckily for keto dieters, these products tend to contain lots of potassium, which we need as a supplement. Read the product label to see how much of which minerals it contains. People with kidney failure, heart failure or diabetes should not use salt substitutes without medical advice",0

I'm sorry about the problems you're experiencing. After taking a medication for a long period of time, it is normal for it to stop working as well for you and for you to have to switch to something else, or adjust the dosage. As to starting the new one, no, if you get things under control, you may be able to lower the dosage or stop taking it in the future. That is something you can discuss with your doctor, if/when things improve. For example, when I had congestive heart failure , after spending a week in the hospital, when I was discharged I was on 11 different medications to get it under control and lower my blood pressure , but after diligently watching my diet, getting exercise and taking care of myself, I am now down to taking just 2 medications. The U.S. FDA lists the typical side effects of the medications that have been prescribed for you as possibly including nausea , dizziness, headache, flatulence and hypoglycemia . Some people actually manage to completely control their diabetes via diet and exercise, so eventually, you may not need any medications, if you are diligent.

If we are here to talk about obesity in a symbolic manner, let me offer a different spectrum. Could obesity be representative of a privileged life with access to an abundance of food which correlates to economic prosperity? Is it not indicative of a first world physique?   We have individuals who are suffering from malnutrition in regions of Africa, who we emphatically donate to for 'the greater good' and for 'humanity' and rightly so. Yet we move onto the opposite spectrum and see individuals who have no solid control over their eating habits and we suddenly correlate such thing with 'artistry'? No, that isn't fair and by blending artistry with obesity doesn't negate the negative impacts it may have.   There's a big difference between being overweight and being morbidly obese. It is the latter that should not be treated in a positive life. The underlying contention of having a positive body image is certainly admirable, but we must be able to realise the reality we live in. In the end, we are human beings who have the capacity to suffer chronic illnesses and heart failure due to a myriad of injuries. Rampant obesity could certainly be correlated with unhealthy eating which correlates to possible clogging of arteries leading to a possible heart attack (as one example). These health effects are often not cognisant with the unwary until it happens to them, which I have had the personal unfortunate experience of knowing someone with such illness. It's not a pretty face.   I don't necessarily disagree with the premises of body image and reducing depression, but I'm also a realist and that individuals have the opportunity to lose weight.   There is a fine line between being overweight and being morbidly obese, which should not be forgotten.""",0

Effective treatment of depression seems to reduce a person?s risk of heart disease, according to a new study. Depression is a known risk factor for heart disease, but how treatment for depression affected that risk was unclear, researchers said. This study of 7,550 people found that effective treatment for depression could lower a patient?s heart risks to the same level as those who never had depression, reducing their chances of stroke, heart attack, heart failure, and death. The risk of major heart problems was: 4.6 percent among those successfully treated for depression: 4.8 percent among those without depression; 6 percent among those with depression who did not respond to treatment; and 6.4 percent among those who developed depression during the study. The findings from the researchers at the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Salt Lake City were to be presented Saturday at an American College of Cardiology meeting in Chicago. Studies presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. ?Our study shows that prompt, effective treatment of depression appears to improve the risk of poor heart health,? Heidi May, a cardiovascular epidemiologist, said in medical center news release. ?With the help of past research, we know depression affects long-term cardiovascular risks, but knowing that alleviating the symptoms of depression reduces a person?s risk of heart disease in the short term, too, can help care providers and patients commit more fully to treating the symptoms of depression,? she said. ?The key conclusion of our study is: If depression isn?t treated, the risk of cardiovascular complications increases significantly,? May said. Further research is needed to determine which types of depression treatment are most effective in reducing heart risks, the researchers said.

However, given the stock finally had a huge bounce on Thursday it is time to revisit the investment case on the company for a larger audience in our Spotlight feature to end the week. The company's primary drug candidate ""Veltassa"" was approved by the FDA to treat hyperkalemia in the United States late last year. The drug is officially being marketed by the company and Relypsa is beefing up its sales force to take advantage of its first mover advantage. This is the first new product to treat hyperkalemia in decades. Sales have been picking up momentum since the initial Veltassa rollout in January. The company just announced Veltassa scripts in February more than doubled over January. Hyperkalemia involves elevated concentration of the electrolyte potassium and symptoms can include malaise, muscle weakness and palpitations, among other symptoms. Hyperkalemia can be potentially fatal and frequently is triggered by other medicines and frequently happens in a hospital setting. There are three to four million patients in the United States alone with hyperkalemia, the vast majority of who have underlying heart failure or kidney disease as the approximate cause of their hyperkalemia.

The study found that those who lose a partner are at an increased risk of developing an irregular heartbeat, also known as atrial fibrillation, which in itself is a risk factor for stroke and heart failure. The researchers noted that the risk appears to be greater in younger people after the death of their loved one, compared to older generations. What's more, the risk of an irregular heartbeat also increases when the death is least expected. Danish researchers collated data from almost 89,000 people diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat between 1995 and 2014 and compared it to 886,000 healthy people. A total of 17,478 of those diagnosed with atrial fibrillation had lost their partner, compared to 168,940 of the comparison group. After taking into account a number of lifestyle factors, the researchers calculated that the risk of developing an irregular heartbeat for the first time was 41% higher among those who had been bereaved. The authors cautioned that no cause and effect can be inferred from the observational study but said that bereavement is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, mental illness, and even death. ""The loss of a partner is considered one of the most severely stressful life events and is likely to affect most people, independently of coping mechanisms,"" the study authors said, according to the Press Association. ""In this large population-based study, the severely stressful life event of losing a partner was associated with a transiently increased risk of atrial fibrillation, which lasted for about one year. ""The elevated risk was especially high for those who were young and those who lost a relatively healthy partner. ""Bereavement is a major life event, which is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, mental illness and death. ""The underlying causal mechanisms for the association between the loss of a partner and AF is unclear, but acute stress may possess direct arrhythmogenic properties by alternating autonomic control, influencing heart rate variability and enhancing pro-inflammatory cytokines."" Maureen Talbot, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, added: ""The bereavement of a partner is a devastating event in anyone's life but the effect can be even worse when a death is sudden or premature. ""Our research has shown how emotional stress can have an adverse effect on the heart but this study also highlights a significant physical effect - a greater risk of developing atrial fibrillation when recently bereaved. This risk appears even greater the more sudden the death or younger that person is. ""Studies to increase understanding of the cause of this finding are needed but it is important to ensure the newly bereaved, regardless of their age, are monitored and supported by their loved ones and to see their GP if they experience any symptoms."" -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

I was 45 on diagnosis but had a 10 year old daughter, so there were a lot of issues that I faced also. 10 years on, my brick has saved my life 5 times by shocking me out of Cardiac Arrest, it has kept my heart going through a lot of other illnesses, not related to heart disease. It even saved me when anyone else without an ICD would have died from Septicemia. I have been through Cancer, Gall Bladder disease and Septicemia, a mitral valve replacement as a result of the septicemia, and more recently appendicitis all in the past 4 years. Through all of these illnesses I have felt assured that I will not die as a result of a Sudden Cardiac Arrest, and as my arteries are still good, I felt that I was protected through all these issues. My heart function is not that good at the moment, my ef has dropped and I am back in CHF again, but honestly the last thing I worry about is the ICD. It has proved that it is a life saver to me. Mind you the first few years I had the device it really didn't need to do much, but in the last 4 years I would be dead if it wasn't there to protect me. I look at all the other people out there in the community who could drop dead from a SCA and know I am protected. Just look at the young athletes that drop dead whilst playing or running, the tragedy of this is that if they were protected with an ICD they would have been able to get up and continue on with their lives. So yes it is a very big procedure to come to terms with. It also is a sign that you are not physically well, that you have heart disease. You are faced with your own mortality and the realization that your world has changed. But once you go through the grieving process regarding these issues, you will come out the other side with a certainty that you are protected by your little in your chest. So glad you have come on here for support, this is a brilliant group, you will not get any of the normal platitudes from us, we speak the truth and from experience. Nothing like peer on peer support as I am sure you realize as a psychologist.",1

Reuters/Vincent West LOS ANGELES British actor Tom Hiddleston explores the short life of country music star Hank Williams in ?I Saw the Light?, and performs the singer?s hits himself in the new biopic. The movie follows Williams? career from his breakthrough in the 1940s to his death from heart failure, slumped in the back of his Cadillac, at the age of 29 in 1953. London-born ?Thor? actor, Hiddleston, said one of the biggest challenges he faced was learning Williams? accent. ?He has a resonant tone of a gospel preacher, which comes from something deep in his southern roots,? he told Reuters at the film?s premiere in Los Angeles on Tuesday night. ?As soon as I started to listen to the cadence and the musicality of the way he spoke, that was when it clicked for me.? He described the singer-songwriter ? whose hits included ?Your Cheatin? Heart? and ?I?m So Lonesome I Could Cry? ? as ?a cornerstone in the development of American music?. ?Music is the most evocative, most immediately emotional art form, I think. My admiration for singers is huge and I think singing is the most naked means of expression, there?s nothing to hide behind,? Hiddleston said. The film also looks at Williams? relationship with his first wife Audrey, played by ?Avengers? star Elizabeth Olsen, which grew more tempestuous as the singer relied increasingly on painkillers and alcohol. It is one of several music biopics, including ?Miles Ahead? with Don Cheadle as Miles Davis and ?Born to Be Blue? in which Ethan Hawke portrays Chet Baker, to be released this year. ?I Saw the Light? opens in cinemas in Los Angeles, New York and Nashville on Friday.

One warning requires Janssen Pharmaceuticals to amend the Invokana label to reflect FDA concerns over kidney injuries. The other alert involves an increased risk of amputations. A May 18, 2016 FDA alert reported that patients in a clinical trial studying Invokana and Invokamet, a combination drug containing canagliflozin, were about twice as likely to undergo amputations as patients taking a placebo. Interim analysis of study data showed that the equivalent of five of every 1,000 patients taking a 300-milligram daily dose of the active ingredient canagliflozin needed amputations, according to Law360 . The equivalent of seven of every 1,000 patients taking a 100-milligram daily dose needed amputations, compared with only three of every 1,000 patients taking a placebo. People with diabetes are already at risk of amputations because the disease can cause nerve damage and impair blood circulation, according to the Mayo Clinic. The amputations affected legs, toes, and feet. FDA officials said they are working to determine whether canagliflozin is responsible for the elevated risk of amputation, but the agency stressed that because of the dangers of uncontrolled blood sugar, patients should not stop taking Invokana without first consulting a doctor. The FDA said ?[p]atients taking [canagliflozin] should notify their health care professionals right away if they notice any new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers, or infections in their legs or feet.? The clinical trial in question is examining how canagliflozin affects cardiovascular health. The trial, which is expected to continue, has followed patients for 4.5 years. Another trial, which followed patients for nine months, did not find an elevated risk of amputation, the FDA said. Officials for Janssen Pharmaceuticals, the maker of Invokana and Invokamet, say they ?remain confident that canagliflozin is an important treatment option for people with Type 2 diabetes,? according to Law360 . The other FDA warning for Invokana was issued on June 14. The FDA announced that Invokana label warnings for kidney disease and kidney injuries would be strengthened. Invokana (canagliflozin) and other diabetes drugs can cause life-threatening kidney injuries. The new warning also includes Farxiga and Xigduo XR (dapagliflozin), drugs in the same class as Invokana. The FDA said these medications could cause worse acute kidney injury than previously known. From March 2013 to October 2015, there were 101confirmed cases of acute kidney injury. One-fifth of those cases required hospitalization in intensive care. Four people died, Law360 reports. The changes to the drug labels will ?include information about acute kidney injury and added recommendations to minimize this risk,? the FDA said. In acute kidney injury, the kidneys suddenly stop working. Signs of acute kidney injury include ?decreased urine or swelling in the legs or feet,? the FDA said. As with the May alert, the FDA said patients should not stop taking the medication because of serious risks if blood sugar is not properly controlled. Anyone who experiences kidney symptoms should seek immediate medical attention and should ask the doctor about continued use of the diabetes medication. In addition, the alert recommends that doctors carefully evaluate the patient?s predisposition for kidney issues ? ?decreased blood volume; chronic kidney insufficiency; congestive heart failure? and use of other medications that may increase the risk through interaction?before prescribing Invokana or a drug in its class.

Congratulations on your good response initially to chemo radiation and now to crizotinib. I?m sorry to hear of the symptoms your pleural effusion is causing, but as Dr. West has stated: ?By the formal criteria used in clinical trials to assess for response or progression, a change in a pleural effusion does not constitute a significant change in disease status. This is because inflammation or infection, or even heart failure, can cause an effusion, and it?s also a product not just of production of fluid but also the draining ability. There are enough variables that we prefer to see it decrease or resolve, but we don?t consider a worsening effusion as clear evidence of progression.? ? http://cancergrace.org/topic/chronic-cough-and-difference-of-opinion#post-1261710 Perhaps you can get symptom relief by draining the effusion, or further intervention may be possible and desirable, such as a pleurodesis, a procedure in which a substance is inserted into the pleural space in an effort to cause the layers of the pleura to stick together, eliminating the friction which causes the fluid to build up.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should rule out cardiac cause for symptoms. Left sided chest pain, left arm numbness, sweating, breathing difficulty etc are commonly seen with heart diseases like coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure. So better to consult doctor and get done 1. Blood pressure monitoring 2. Ecg 3. 2d echo 4. Stress test (trade mill test). You may need cardiac supportive drugs on the basis of these reports. If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright but first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",0

Biology is weird and messy. I get it. But geez! Admittedly I'm assuming the physicists behind ITER have done their work and it is a fundamentally sound concept for generating electricity, even if it hasn't actually been finished yet, where as the artificial lung machines that are currently used are large, stop-gap measures that brute-force the gas exchange problem - some pretty spectacular leaps in nanotech will be required to create something implantable that actually solves the problem efficiently. The current models linked to above have known, severe side effects such as heart failure and only reason they're going to clinical trials now is because half the people on the transplant waiting list are dying anyway - anything is better than doing nothing. Seriously, I would love to be wrong about this stuff, so how about this: If an artificial lung gets invented before I die (I'm 33), that is as good or better than the real thing*, I will run butt naked down the main street of my city (St George's Terrace, Perth, Australia) and post photo evidence here (assuming this site still exists), and be fine with that, because hooray! Artificial Lungs. *Conditions: 1. Implantable and does not impede reasonable physical activities or substantially increase risk of other conditions such as heart failure. 2. does not require constant/recurring pharmaceuticals to avoid rejection. 3. good for the average lifetime of the patient (caveat: I'm assuming regular battery replacements/charging a la cochlear implant) or 25 years, whichever is the lesser. I'd add that I used to work with one group that was developing an artificial pancreas, but the non-invasive methodology they were using had limitations so others beat them to the punch. Also, pancreas is probably not a great organ to base your hopes on - it is considered """"low-hanging fruit"""" among the organs (because we already know how to make synthetic insulin - itself a relatively simple molecule), so while I'm glad diabetics have that going for them, there's a pretty large leap in knowledge required between being able to do a single level readout on blood and inject a presynthesized molecule in a corresponding manner, versus actually replicating biochemical processes.",0

But most we would never want to live through ourselves. Two hundred families showed up Saturday at Stanford University for a conference called ""Affairs of the Heart: Living with Inherited Cardiomyopathy."" One of its more common types is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM. The disease, borne of an inherited gene mutation that causes over-contraction of the heart muscle, was the thread that linked everyone here -- the doctors and nurses from Stanford's Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease, experts and industry pioneers sharing the latest research on a malady that can cause critical heart failure and even sudden death in young people, as well as HCM patients and their parents. ""HCM sometimes comes with the growth spurt of the teenage years,"" said Dr. Euan Ashley, the center's director and an internationally renowned expert in the disease that affects about one in 500 people. ""And while it can also show up with older people, it's also among the most common causes of death in young athletes.'' Advertisement Early symptoms include chest pains and shortness of breath caused by decreased blood flow through the ventricles. And the disease, if diagnosed in time, can sometimes be treated by medication, implanted devices and, in the most dire cases, surgery and heart transplants. In about half the cases, Ashley said, genetic and other tests can help doctors determine the exact cause of the HCM. But that's often just the beginning: ""When we screen other relatives, including mother, father, brothers and sisters,'' he said, ""we find a 50 percent chance of someone else sharing the diagnosis.'' The Bingham family from eastern Oregon knows all too much about those perilous odds. Stacy Bingham, who was at the conference, said her 16-year-old daughter, Sierra, suffers from a related heart disease known as dilated cardiomyopathy and has already undergone two heart transplants after her body rejected the first heart. Sierra's younger sister, who also has the disease, received a new heart at Stanford. And their younger brother is now at the same hospital, awaiting a transplant of his own. ""After the first transplant, I thought I was doing great,'' Sierra said during an interview outside the conference room. At the time of the first operation, when Sierra was 6, Sierra was too young to fully grasp what was going on, her mother said. ""Before the transplant, she asked us, 'How long will it take them to make a new heart for me?' "" When that organ was rejected, Sierra recalled, ""I kind of freaked out that I'd have to have a second transplant."" Sierra, who had that surgery a year ago, now says that prayer helps and ""even though you can never see the future, I feel great; I think this one will work out.'' These days, she helps comfort her brother Gage, who had a pacemaker put in when he was 4 and now, at age 7, is waiting for a transplant of his own. ""Sometimes my brother get scared,"" Sierra said. ""He asked me: 'Does it hurt to get a new heart?' "" While medications such as beta blockers can sometimes relieve symptoms and prevent further complications, they're not always enough. Conference attendee Sef Samatua, a 43-year-old tatoo artist from San Jose with two young daughters, was diagnosed with HCM in 2009 after he experienced an irregular heartbeat while working out at the gym. After several years and several invasive heart procedures, Samatua has changed his diet and takes medication, ""but I still feel the palpitations more as I get older. It feels like my heart's skipping a beat."" While testing revealed that both his kids carry the genetic makeup associated with HCM, neither has been diagnosed. The family works together on keeping everyone healthy. ""We steer the girls away from sports,"" he said, ""while they help remind me to be careful to not eat too much salt and fats.'' Samatua said that because the beta blockers aren't enough to fully treat his HCM, he'll soon make an appointment to receive a surgically inserted ICD, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, which will monitor his heart rhythm. If the battery-operated device detects an abnormal heart rate, it delivers energy to the heart muscle to make it beat normally again. In the meantime, Samatua said, he remains upbeat and devotes much of his time to ""spreading awareness of this condition."" ""When people talk about a disease like this, they think they can't do anything about it,"" he said. ""But my diagnosis uplifted me. I want to help others who've lost hope and share my story to show them that you can still lead a good life, even with HCM.""

Researchers aren't sure exactly what makes some players susceptible to the disease and others not. Factors such as genetics and age of first impact may play a role. But what is clear for many researchers is that it occurs because of repeated head trauma that results in a buildup of an abnormal protein called tau. The tangles of tau can overtake parts of the brain that control for memory, mood and aggression. The symptoms are similar to Alzheimer's but begin much earlier. There are four stages of the disease, and the most severe cases can result in suicidal thoughts. 5 things to know about CTE Fred Jr. remembers hearing the headlines of other players. Dave Duerson , Junior Seau and Mike Webster all seemed to have parallels to his father's life. ""That's when you start to realize -- OK, yeah, the rage, the forgetfulness, the identity crisis,"" he said. Gavin even talked to his father about suicide, and his dad brushed it off. ""'I'm not going to do that, nah, nah,' just joking around,"" Gavin recalled. It's a conversation no son should have with their father. All Gavin could say was, ""I hope you wouldn't. I love you. Just know that. If you hear me, hear that first."" CTE has no cure. It can only be diagnosed with an autopsy. Tia McNeill had no idea at the time what her husband's future looked like, but she knew that when he passed, she would have Omalu evaluate his brain. ""We wanted to know,"" she said. Diagnosing the living In 2012, Omalu approached the McNeills with a new technology that he had helped developed and is invested in. Called TauMark , it uses a radioactive ""tracer"" called FDDNP to bind to tau proteins in the brain. The tau proteins can then be seen on a positron emission tomography, or PET scan. Omalu explained to CNN that this technology could only be licensed to corporations and that his motive behind it is not profit but research. When Omalu and his team examined the scan, there were angry red splotches all over Fred McNeill's brain. His wife wasn't surprised. Living brain scans of five former NFL players, including Fred McNeill. Critics say the test is too early. It's only been used on 14 former football players . But more importantly, they say it isn't precise enough. It binds to tau as well as amyloid proteins, a signature for Alzheimer's. Omalu said it's not just what the marker is highlighting, but where the highlights are. Tau has a distinctive pattern in CTE, and Omalu said his test is tracing the tau in the same places he's found it in autopsies. Meanwhile, McNeill's dementia continued to worsen. His outbursts became more extreme. Ultimately, the family moved him into an assisted living facility. ""It was more for his safety,"" Tia McNeill said. A different kind of care Fred McNeill found a home at the Silverado Beverly Memory Care Community in Los Angeles a few blocks from Gavin's office and minutes away from his wife's home. Silverado is one of the NFL's two preferred providers of memory care. It was the best care they could find, but Tia McNeill said it was never a perfect fit. There were 70-, 80-, 90-year-olds at the facility, and Fred McNeill was just in his early 60s, still relatively fit. He wanted to walk, throw around footballs. He loved music and karaoke. Former NFL players need a different kind of care, Tia McNeill contends. Sylvia Mackey, wife of Hall of Famer John Mackey , agrees. She wrote a letter to then-NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue about caring for her husband's dementia. The letter was the impetus to form the 88 Plan , the NFL's benefit plan for players experiencing dementia, Lou Gehrig's disease and Parkinson's. Sylvia Mackey gets calls from NFL wives all the time about what to look for and what they can do to help their husbands. She recalled when her husband entered a nursing home, surrounded by folks in wheelchairs, who could barely get around. She remembers him pushing the other residents in their wheelchairs. She said it wasn't just the age difference, but the pure physical difference of the former football players. They need larger beds and larger equipment. ""As the disease progresses and they become less mobile, they need lift chairs, things they need to help them move around. And the staff can't shoulder that physically themselves. They need equipment to help,"" Mackey said. Fred McNeill was a linebacker for the Minnesota Vikings. She also said the former athletes still identify as players, brothers of a certain bond. Tia McNeill agrees. She said her husband lit up when he found out Manfred Moore, a former pro football player, was also at Silverado. The two had played college football against each other when Fred McNeill was at UCLA and Moore at rival USC. It's not clear how many former players are now in assisted living facilities. In 2014, Loren Shook, president and CEO of Silverado, told the Chicago Sun Times, ""We have treated about 20 NFL players -- we have about a dozen right now."" CNN has reached out to the NFL Retired Players Association but has not heard back. However, through the NFL Alumni Association, Sylvia Mackey is now working with Validus Senior Living to open an assisted living facility in all 33 NFL cities. Each facility would work with a younger, and healthier, population, dealing with dementia. ""There's no road map. There's no support for this,"" Tia McNeill said. ""There's no protocol when you're afflicted with CTE -- what it looks like and how to care for that person best."" She wants there to be more. A final blow In March 2014, Fred McNeill was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Studies have found that former professional football players are four times more likely to suffer neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. McNeill's hands had become shaky; he was losing control from the waist up. He eventually was put on feeding tubes because he couldn't eat. On November 2, McNeill's family brought him home from the hospital. They wanted him to enjoy his last days in peace. ""We brought him home on a Monday morning, and he passed. ... He wasn't here 24 hours,"" Tia McNeill recalled. 19 photos: Athletes and CTE Former Minnesota Vikings linebacker Fred McNeill died in November 2015 at the age of 63, due to complications from ALS. However, an autopsy confirmed that he suffered from CTE. What makes McNeill's case even more remarkable, though, is that he was potentially the first to be diagnosed while alive. Doctors used an experimental new technology to examine his brain.Scientists believe repeated head trauma can cause CTE, a progressive degenerative disease of the brain. Symptoms include depression, aggression, and disorientation, but so far scientists can only definitively diagnose it after death. Here are a few of the former athletes who have been diagnosed with CTE.

Abstract: Crataegus laevigata is a medicinal plant most commonly used for the treatment of heart failure and psychosomatic disorders. Based on previous experimental findings, this double-blind placebo-controlled study was aimed at finding beneficial effects of C. laevigata on biomarkers of coronary heart disease (CHD). The study included 49 diabetic subjects with chronic CHD who were randomly assigned to the treatment for 6 months with either a micronized flower and leaf preparation of C. laevigata (400 mg three times a day) or a matching placebo. Blood cell count, lipid profile, C-reactive protein, neutrophil elastase (NE) and malondialdehyde were analyzed in plasma at baseline, at one month and six months. The main results were that NE decreased in the C. laevigata group compared to the placebo group. In the C. laevigata group, baseline figures (median and interquartile range) were 35.8 (4.5) and in the placebo group 31 (5.9). At the end of the study, values were 33.2 (4.7) ng/ml and 36.7 (2.2) ng/ml, respectively; p",0

""Prior to the funeral service, there will be an opportunity for members of the public to pay their respects at the Library,"" its statement said. ""Details will be announced shortly.""

Born Anne Frances Robbins on July 6, 1921 -- and given the name Nancy by her mother -- Mrs. Reagan's father left the family when she was young. Her mother, Edith Robbins, toured the country as an actress. Mrs. Reagan later married Dr. Loyal Davis, and the family settled in Chicago. Having caught the acting bug from her mother, young Nancy pursued the profession in New York and Hollywood, where she met with fellow actor Ronald Reagan. The two married on March 4, 1952. The former Nancy Davis made 11 films in all, her last one coming in 1956: Hellcats of the Navy, co-starring her husband. After her husband's election as governor of California in 1966, Mrs. Reagan began projects to assist wounded Vietnam veterans, prisoners of war, and service members missing in action. As first lady of the United States, Mrs. Reagan made drug abuse a central focus for her ""Just Say No"" program. The library said that Mrs. Reagan is survived by her brother, Dr. Richard Davis; her two children with Ronald Reagan -- Patti Davis and Ronald Prescott Reagan -- as well numerous nieces and nephews. In lieu of flowers, Mrs. Reagan had requested that memorial contributions be made to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Foundation, the announcement said. ??

In the same week her divorce was to be final, she was scheduled as an outpatient for an ablation (a type of heart surgery) on Wednesday and replacement breast implant surgery on Friday. The post-surgical recovery would have most people flat on their backs for more than just a few days. Imagine my surprise when she answered her door for a manual lymph drainage massage the day after the heart surgery. The immune system does not react well to being over-stressed. Margarette was experiencing a very stressful time in her life. She had swelling in her right leg from the malfunctioning valve in her heart. The collapsed breast implant left her chest feeling heavy. As a medical massage therapist, I suggested she relieve some of the discomfort with a medical massage modality called Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD). This specialized technique is designed to stimulate the immune system and help the lymphatic system achieve healing in the body. Margarette received MLD both before and immediately after her surgeries. Pre-operative MLD cleans the area so that there is little bleeding, creating an environment that decreases pain levels and the chance for infection. This primed her lymph system to start moving toxins out of her body before the surgeries. The effects of MLD last up to 72 hours, depending upon the duration of the massage. The result is that it slows the amount of bleeding during surgery and causes the body to begin detoxifying the chemicals from the anesthesia and other medications immediately. The post-operative session kept the process going, diminishing pain levels to the point where Margarette didn?t need any medication. She recovered so quickly, she was back at work by the following Wednesday, missing only five workdays. MLD uses very gentle, precise strokes to promote the release of fluid build-up in the body called edema. Any interruption in lymph circulation can impair the functioning of the body?s immune system, its ability to repair damaged tissue, and cause chemical imbalance in the body. If left untreated, the swelling could potentially lead to a more serious medical condition called lymphedema. Edema is a condition defined as swelling that occurs when interstitial fluid builds up in the muscles of the body. Lymphedema is a build up of fluid in the lymph system. Unlike edema, lymphedema can become a chronic condition that has consequences for the whole body. Swelling, pain, numbness, sensation of pressure, increased susceptibility to infection, loss of mobility, and impaired wound healing are all a result of chronic lymphedema. Chronic swelling has four levels of manifestation: micro edema, mild or pitting edema, non-pitting edema, and severe hardening. The first two can be reversed and usually completely alleviated with MLD. The last two cannot be reversed but MLD may help relieve the symptoms. Some reasons why the lymph system will respond with edema include illness, lack of exercise, injury (i.e. sports, surgery, disease) and being on an airplane flight. MLD helps both acute and chronic conditions. Types of conditions that MLD cannot help include kidney disease (nephritis), leaking blood vessels, varicose veins, third degree burns, congestive heart failure, untreated high blood pressure, obstructions in the circulation system (thrombosis or clots), and active cancers. Most people learn about the effects of lymphedema when they experience cancer. Based on client feedback, very little information is disseminated to non-cancer patients about how to take care of the swelling they experience after a sports injury, accident, or surgical procedure. Not very many people are told about the benefits of MLD prior to surgical events or the impact on healing after surgery. I have discussed MLD with heart surgeons, podiatrists, chiropractors, and orthopedic and plastic surgeons. It is my concern that few know how to fully utilize MLD or pay any attention to the role that edema plays in healing. Doctors don?t seem to be addressing the impact chronic swelling has when treating conditions that won?t heal appropriately. I have used MLD to treat clients who have experienced injuries from sports (acute and chronic), accidents or surgeries; cancer patients in remission, Parkinson?s patients, pregnant women, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, allergies and sinus problems. I recommend MLD for breast cancer prevention and maintenance. If you knew that this natural, non-invasive treatment was available and it works, why wouldn?t you do it?

(Reuters) - Nearly 1,000 guests, led by first lady Michelle Obama and representatives from nine former White House families, assembled on Friday for a memorial tribute to Nancy Reagan at her late husband's presidential library in Southern California. Funeral services for the former Hollywood actress and first lady capped two days during which thousands of mourners filed past her flower-bedecked casket at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, north of Los Angeles. She is to be buried beside her husband in a private grave side service on Friday evening, following a 90-minute televised ceremony. Dignitaries expected to attend the service include former first lady and now Democratic front-runner in the 2016 presidential race Hillary Clinton, and celebrities Frank Sinatra's daughter, Tina, and Oscar-winning actress Anjelica Huston. The Santa Susana High School choir are performing now. #nancyreagan #SimiValley A photo posted by Michael Coons (@michael_coons) on Mar 11, 2016 at 10:42am PST The service brought together Republicans and Democrats alike to pay final respects for a woman especially admired by political conservatives at a time when deep partisan rancor has reverberated through Washington and the 2016 presidential campaign. Organizers said 950 guests in all were expected for the invitation-only memorial, held inside a large white tent on the south lawn of the library, and they began arriving by shuttle bus at 8 a.m. PST (1600 GMT) under sunny skies and light clouds. Always fiercely protective of her husband, Nancy Reagan was regarded as one of the most influential presidential spouses in U.S. history during his Republican administration from 1981 to 1989. Guests are starting to arrive for Nancy Reagan's funeral. #SimiValley A photo posted by Michael Coons (@michael_coons) on Mar 11, 2016 at 10:39am PST She died on Sunday of congestive heart failure at age 94. Ronald Reagan died in 2004 after a long struggle with Alzheimer's disease, the progressive brain disorder that destroys memory. He was 93. ""They truly loved each other,"" Edwin Meese, the longtime Reagan aide who served as attorney general in his Cabinet, told reporters. ""Her life really was devoted to encouraging and supporting him, and that carried on even after he went into total seclusion and even when he was no longer capable of really sometimes even responding to that love."" Biographer Craig Shirley recalled that Nancy Reagan also played a direct role at times in the political affairs of her husband, such as having a hand in the firing of campaign manager John Sears in 1980 and the dismissal of chief of staff Donald Regan in 1987. The funeral was scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. PST with music performed by a choir from the nearby Santa Susana High School and a U.S. Marine Corps band. A photo posted by Freddy Ford (@kyfredchicken) on Mar 11, 2016 at 11:16am PST The program also includes a letter from Ronald to Nancy Reagan, to be recited by former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and eulogies by Reagan's chief of staff, James Baker, former NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, and two of Reagan's children - her daughter Patti Davis and son, Ron Jr. Leading the roster of VIP mourners slated to attend is Michelle Obama, joined by close relatives of all of President Barack Obama's nine immediate predecessors, including former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura. The list of those expected to attend the service include Jimmy Carter's wife, Rosalynn, Caroline Kennedy, daughter of the late President John Kennedy, children of Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. Others expected include television news veterans Katie Couric, Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer, as well as such showbiz figures as Anjelica Huston, Wayne Newton, Gary Sinise and Mr. T, who was a supporter of Nancy Reagan's anti-drug campaign. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

We have the answers to a variety of common vein problems, including varicose and spider vein treatments. Always have an Ultrasound performed before allowing ANY procedures to test for reflux disease, as further complications could arise if undetected and the varicose veins could return. When was the last time you paid any attention to your veins? Maybe when you gave blood? And yet they are an integral part of the vascular system that keeps us alive-day in and day out-whether we think about it or not. Veins are the blood vessels that carry blood back to the heart and into the lungs to be replenished with the oxygen and nutrients the body needs to function and stay healthy. For the blood to get to the heart from the legs it must travel upwards, against gravity. It does this with the help of the veins and the muscle that surrounds them. When we stand and walk, the muscles constrict, squeezing the veins and pushing the blood toward the heart through a system of valves. When we sit or at rest, the muscles relax and valves within the veins close to prevent blood from flowing back into the legs and feet. About 90 percent of our blood returns to the heart by way of the deep veins-veins that lie deep within the body. The other two types of veins are superficial and connecting. Superficial veins are the ones you can see through your skin. They carry blood from tissue closer to the surface of your skin to the deep veins where the blood flows to the heart. Connecting veins carry blood from the superficial veins to the deep veins. Unfortunately, our veins can also develop problems. The following chart lists and describes the most common vein problems that can develop in the legs. Some are more serious than others, but all are worth discussing with your doctor. Type of Vein Problem Description Thrombosis A blood clot in the vein. Blood clots can block blood flow or break free and travel through the blood stream to the heart and lungs (pulmonary embolism). Thrombophlebitis Swelling caused by a blood clot in the vein. It can occur in the superficial or deep veins. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) With DVT, blood clots form in the large veins deep within the legs, pelvis, and sometimes in the arms. DVT strikes about 1 in 20 people over the course of a lifetime. Pulmonary Embolism (PE) When a blood clot breaks free from a deep vein and makes its way into an artery in the lung, it is called a pulmonary embolism (PE). PE is life-threatening condition that can cause heart failure. It is important to call 911 if you have trouble breathing or if you are coughing up blood. Post-Thrombotic Syndrome (also known as post-phlebitic syndrome and venous stress disorder) In this condition, the symptoms of pain, heaviness in the leg or foot, cramps; itching; tingling; bluish or brownish, flaky skin; sores; and varicose veins caused by DVT continue after treatment, either because the blood clot is still there or the blood clot caused other damage to the vein. Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) venous reflux high blood pressure in the vein (venous hypertension) varicose veins spider veins CVI is damage or weakness in the vein wall or vein valve that allows blood to flow backl down into the vein (venous reflux). The backflow of blood accumulates in the veins and causes inflammation (phlebitis) and more clotting. Clotting can block or slow blood flow through the vein raising the blood pressure and possibly causing more damage. Varicose and spider veins are caused by the accumulation of the blood from venous reflux. Phlebitis Swelling in the deep or superficial veins is called phlebitis. Venous Sores When pressure in the veins continues for a long time, it can break down healthy tissue, which causes ulcers or sores. Congenital Vascular Malformation (includes birthmarks) This is a catch-all term for the very few people, less than 1 percent, who are born with veins that are defective in some way. For example, the veins may not have valves. This category also includes birthmarks that are a mass of veins close to the skin.

Calculation of the sample size was based on mortality from cardiovascular causes. We estimated that we would need to follow approximately 8000 patients for 34 months, with 1229 deaths from cardiovascular causes, to provide the study with a power of 80% to detect a relative reduction of 15% in the risk of death from cardiovascular causes in the LCZ696 group, at an overall two-sided alpha level of 0.05. On the basis of these calculations, we estimated that the primary end point would occur in 2410 patients, which would provide a power of 97% to detect a 15% reduction in the risk of this outcome. Death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure (the primary end point) occurred in 914 patients (21.8%) in the LCZ696 group and 1117 patients (26.5%) in the enalapril group (hazard ratio in the LCZ696 group, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.87; P<0.001 [exact P=4.0?10-7]) (Figure 2AFigure 2Kaplan?Meier Curves for Key Study Outcomes, According to Study Group. and Table 2Table 2Primary and Secondary Outcomes.). The difference in favor of LCZ696 was seen early in the trial and at each interim analysis. A total of 558 deaths (13.3%) in the LCZ696 group and 693 (16.5%) in the enalapril group were due to cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.89; P<0.001) (Figure 2B and Table 2). Of the patients receiving LCZ696, 537 (12.8%) were hospitalized for heart failure, as compared with 658 patients (15.6%) receiving enalapril (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.89; P<0.001) (Figure 2C and Table 2).

I share this in honor of all veterans, especially in view of the coming memorial day. (X-post from /r/askreddit - physicians, work related stories)","About 30 years ago I completed my Internal Medicine training in Upstate, New York, which included a weekly outpatient clinic, and ward rotations at the local VA hospital. I love military history, and enjoyed the opportunity to talk to many WW II veterans back then. (There were even a few WW I soldiers still around in those days). These were everyday, working class, even humble men who quietly lived common lives, but had participated in some of the most storied and celebrated battles in the last century. They were part of a generation that made tremendous sacrifices, and embodied many of the values that made America great. It was my privilege to hear some of the stories of this so called ?greatest generation? first hand. One WW II veteran was in my clinic for over two years. So, I was his physician for an extended period time. He was a tall, large man with a long grey beard, and he always wore a confederate cap. I always thought the hat reflected a bit of his gentlemanliness demeanor with just a hint of a rebel in him. He was a simple man, who, although I was so much younger, basically a kid in those days, always treated me with the utmost respect, and called me, ?doc? but never with my last name. We got to know each other fairly well, as he was in severe chronic heart failure, so I was seeing him in my clinic on a frequent basis to adjust his medications. One day he told me his own personal story about the war. It turned out he had served under Patton in North Africa. He described the scene of his last battle in that war, and in my minds eye, I felt I was there. He was on a high hill and the Germans had overrun and nearly surrounded his position. Most of his company had been killed or retreated. From his position he could see the enemy advancing on three sides. It was rock and gravel and sand, like the moon. There was dust, and the smell gunpowder, and the smoke and odor of burning diesel and oil. The Germans could not see his exact location and so were firing indiscriminately up the hill. On the other hand, from his vantage point, he could see the terrain well, and was systematically picking off enemy soldiers one at a time with well placed rifle shots. He was apparently, incredibly deliberate and collected under the most intense circumstances. His own foxhole buddy was already down, but he thought still alive; it was only a matter of time before they were both either dead or prisoners. Suddenly, the enemy stopped firing, and my friend knew that the Germans were sending a scout to ascertain his precisef location to better target his position. He also knew that he only had a few moments left. So he picked up his buddy in a fireman?s carry and started running away from the enemy positions. Had he not been carrying his friend, he would have been able to move much faster. He was nearly over the crest of the hill that would have put him, temporarily out of sight and gun range, when he was knocked down. A bullet tore through his left shoulder and upper chest. He fell heavily to the ground with a gaping chest wound. His friend rolled a short distance completely inert. It was only much later he would find out his buddy did not survive. My friend was bleeding heavily, but his next breath collapsed his lung, and much of the bleeding must have slowed. He lost consciousness, and awoke in the dark. He was unable to get up, and drifted in and out of consciousness all night. The next day, he was picked up by American forces that had reclaimed that territory of the battlefield. His wounds were severe and his recovery prolonged, but he survived; though he never fought in uniform again. He was awarded the Purple Heart, but other more prestigious metals of distinction would never come, because no one else lived to testify about his heroism. He had not told the story to many people he said, because he just never enjoyed talking about the war. A lifetime of cigarettes and alcohol had taken a toll on him as he fought other ?inner? battles; not the kind of fights that were won by guns or violence. When I met him, as I mentioned, he was also battling severe health problems. Remarkably, I was able to keep him out of the hospital for a fairly long time. However, eventually things fell apart, and he was hospitalized and started a down hill spiral. He had been in for a few weeks, and just not getting better. During that time he had no visitors, and he never spoke of family, so I suspected he was alone in the world. I was on call every third night, which typically meant working 36 hours straight. It was after midnight, and I visited him in the ICU. The room was dark, and we could only see from the dim lights in the hallway. He knew that he only had a short time left. He thanked me for the care I had given him, and then started talking about the war again; ?You know doc, I never regretted the things I did, or those Germans I killed. I knew if I didn?t kill them, they would kill me. But lately, in my dreams, I?m seeing the faces of all those young German boys I killed.? I thought to myself, ?their faces?? I pondered if this was a trick of his memory, but didn?t ask how close quartered his combat experience had been. Generally, you see an enemy?s face in hand-to-hand combat. I had always presumed the enemy was far away, and never really knew exactly how many there had been. Now, in his final battle, he was going back to one of his first battles. Death is the final enemy, and my friend knew he was going to the same place to which he had sent others to years ago. He died that night, alone with his memories, and ?dreams.? He was a soldier, a patriot, a hero, and had become my friend. Many of us don?t really understand the physical and mental burdens our veterans carry with them, often for their entire lives. It was my honor to know and serve this true hero. Thank you friend for your service and sacrifice; and also thanks to all the countless others who have served in uniform, fought, killed and even died for our safety and freedom.",0

Two years later on June 17, 2016 I had my second and a small third one a month later. I was hospitalized for the first two. They performed a stress test on 6/17/2016. Stress test findings were: """"There does not appear to be any increase in lung uptake. Review of the images shows no evidence of significant decreased tracer uptake suggesting ischemia. Review of the gated images shows the right ventricle to be normal in size, wall motion and wall thickening. Ejection fraction at 71%. IMPRESSION: Normal gated Lexiscan Tc-99m scan without any overt evidence of ischemia. ECG portion of the study was negative for ischemia. Left ventricular function is normal with an ejection fraction of 71%"""". Echo results performed in sinus rhythm on 6/17/2016: 1. LV ejection fraction is estimated to be 55-60%. 2. Doppler filling pattern indicates no diastolic dysfunction. 3. Mild to moderate thickening/calcification of anterior and posterior mitral leaflets. 4. Calculated mitral valve area by pressure 1/2 time is 3.06 cm. 5. Moderately decreased mitral posterior leaflet mobility. 6. Mild mitral stenosis ... mean gradient 5 mmHG. 7. Mild-moderately left dilated left atrium (4.30 cm). 8. Mild mitral valve regurgitation. 9. Mild mitral annular calcification. 10. Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation. 11. Mild pulmonary hypertension. How do these findings affect my AFib? Will the dilated left atrium cause eventual heart failure? Does it increase in size with every episode? Am I a candidate for ablation with these mitral valve issues? I am scared now to do anything...don't know when next one will hit. I have lived with extreme anxiety all my life. I just want to find some peace with this. I don't see the cardiologist until November. I am on metoprolol and warfarin (also an 81 mg aspirin). I want the ablation if at all possible. Thanking anyone who responds in advance. Just an after thought...I had a knee replacement on 5/10/2016.",1

I do. Well, the so-called anti-scientists had it far more right than their accusers. Adult stem cells from patients' own bodies have been shown in studies to halve deaths from heart failure in comparison to patients receiving placebo. From the Telegraph story: Stem cells can repair a damaged heart and potentially halve the number of people dying from heart failure, scientists have shown, in a major breakthrough for regenerative medicine... Now, in the largest trial ever conducted, doctors in the US have proven that even the most serious cases of heart failure can be repaired using stem cells harvested from a patient's own bone marrow. End-stage patients, whose only hope was a heart transplant, were treated with stem cells in a single operation. Doctors found the group were 37 per cent less likely to have been admitted to hospital in the 12 months following the operation and half as likely to have died than those on placebo. I did a Google search and found very few stories covering this wonderful breakthrough. How telling about media bias, still in the tank for the embryonic approach. Indeed, if this had been an embryonic stem cell breakthrough, you would have heard the headlines. Don't be surprised if the next embryonic stem cell animal study brings greater news coverage than this very hopeful story of an ethical technique now alleviating great human suffering.

Beta-blockers, such as propranolol, act by blocking beta-1 and beta-2 receptors throughout the body. beta-1 receptors, when stimulated, cause an increase in heart rate, among other effects. beta-2 receptors, when stimulated, cause a whole bunch of other things such as vasodilation (relaxation of blood vessels), relax bronchioles, etc Now, beta-blockers are usually given to someone in heart failure or with atrial fibrillation. In these states, the heart is working to hard at rest and is doing damage to itself because of this work. Because it is working so hard, it is becoming ischemic (a lack of oxygen and other nutrients). Beta-blockers block beta receptors and cause the resting heart rate to decrease. This causes the heart to not work as hard at rest, which increases the survival for people with these conditions. Now, beta-blockers block a certain amount of beta-adrenergic stimulation, but not all of it; that would be very dangerous. So when you exercise, even if you are taking your beta-blockers, there is such a flood of acetylcholine, the molecule that stimulates beta-blockers, that it can bind to receptors even in the presence of the drug and cause an increase in heart rate. Therefore, even if you are on the drug, you still get increases in heart rate with higher than normal levels of stimulation.",0

It started Christmas Day 2014. I made dinner for the family and was exhausted by 6pm. I did too much throughout the day and by 8pm my right ankle was very swollen and painful. I spent last year having steroid injections which eased it a little. My orthopaedic surgeon said it was my tendon and prescribed orthotic insoles. I came off Humira in December 2015 due to side effects and my rheumatologist went back to India in January. I started to flare badly and the nurse increased prednisolone to 20mg from 6. I've been on pred for 3 years now without a break (they're causing a whole new set of problems). It took time to see a new rheumy who put me on Cimzia in April. It's working really well for my RD but my foot is still very painful. For the past 3 weeks my ankle and metatarsals have swollen. I saw my orthopaedic surgeon last month and he said I need to see my rheumy as he thinks it's RD but I'm not convinced as it doesn't feel like it is. I don't see my rheumy until October and the specialist nurse in August. I'm a bit worried as the skin on my toes have white and purple patches where I think the swelling is obstructing blood flow. I saw my GP last week and she sent me for a BNP blood test to rule out heart failure. One of the symptoms is being breathless and I have been but put it down to the heat and weight gain.

Bleacher Report?s Jeremy Botter would later report the Ohio State Buckeye legend was hospitalized with pneumonia before suffering heart failure. Randleman (17-16) first emerged onto the mixed martial arts scene in 1996, winning the UVTF 4 one night tournament with three straight stoppage wins. ?The Beast? eventually made his way over to the UFC, debuting at UFC 19 as a entrant in the Road To The Heavyweight Title Tournament. After earning a unanimous decision over former champion Maurice Smith, Randleman dropped a split decision in the tournaments final round to future UFC Hall of Famer Bas Rutten. The judge?s decision remains one of the most controversial decision in MMA history. Randleman later rebounded with a unanimous decision over Pete Williams, earning the vacant UFC heavyweight champion in the process. He would later defend it one time before suffering a third round TKO to Randy Couture, another future Hall of Famer. Randleman fought just two more times under the UFC banner, suffering a first round KO to Chuck Liddell and earning a decision over Renato Sobral, before jumping over toe Pride FC in Japan. It was here Randleman took part in many of his most famous bouts, including a thrilling first round KO victory over MMA legend Mirko Cro Cop. For his performance, Randleman earned both Upset and Knockout of the Year. His follow-up performance would eventually go down as one of the most iconic scenes in MMA history. In front of a sold out crowd at the Saitama Super Arena, Randleman dropped pound-for-pound great Fedor Emelianenko on his skull with a powerful suplex. However, Emelianenko quickly recovered and finished Randleman with a first round kimura. Randleman would close his career with losses in eight of his next 10 bouts, including submission setbacks to Cro Cop, Mauricio ?Shogun? Rua and Roger Gracie. In his last professional bout, fans saw Randleman suffer yet another submission loss, this time at the hands Baga Agaev in May 2011. He finished his career with nine stoppage wins, including five by way of knockout.",0

Thank goodness. So Monkeyman went in on Thursday early morning, without complaint because he couldn't eat or drink or had to wake up early just to go and sit and wait and wait and wait at hospital. He is such a sweet, sweet boy. Having an aspergers child in the house, I can't help but appreciate his cooperation and non-defiant behaviour so very, very much. It makes his and our life soooo easy. I know, it's unfair that I compare him and his sister, but hey, they're siblings. It's impossible NOT to notice when one child screams her head off about everything, and another says ""yes mom, of course mom"" to every thing you demand of him. :-) So Monkeyman got to the hospital and entertained himself on his tablet for hours and hours. And watched a bit of tv. We got to talk to all three the doctors before the op. The pediatric gastro-enterologist (GE) answered some of our questions, and really calmed my nerves. The ph-doctor came to discuss the procedure and what GERD is, etc. And was really surprised when she realised not only do we exactly know, and that our whole family has it, but that SHE was the one that did my, my eldest daughter and eldest son's ph-studies 10 years ago as well. :-) Then came this really, really young looking anaesthesiologist. It scared my husband a bit, to trust our son who has had anaesthesia problems into the hands of someone looking like he hasn't even finished medical school, let alone specialised already! But somehow, I was ok with it. Thinking that maybe as a young dr, he would be up to date on all the newest things. And it turned out to be true!! Before the operation, my husband went to a lot of trouble to contact the previous 3 anaesthesiologist that took care of Monkeyman (the GE doctor asked him to). My husband requested a list of all the medications they used, and we put all of it together on one page, which we presented this newest anaestheologist with. He listened carefully to the symptoms and progression that Monkeyman experienced every time he received anaesthesia. It was always the same. He would wake up confused (like any normal child), screaming, fighting, crying. Then, in time, he calmed down and sometimes would fall asleep. When he had the pulmonary hypertension, he slept for 3 hours after the anaesthesia!! Still, this is all normal. Then, about 3-4 hours after the anaesthesia, everytime, the vomitting starts. Doesn't matter how strong the anti-nausea meds they give him during the anaesthesia. This continues for the rest of the day. Gagging and vomitting. Inbetween nausea. Then the physical tiredness. He can barely lift his head. Walking to the bathroom is too much to bear. He just lies down on the couch and doesn't move for hours and hours. About 6 hours after anaesthesia, the fevers starts. This continues for about 24 hours. Around this time, or a bit earlier, his nose starts to run, and it clogs up, with his eye(s) tearing. Exactly like a cold. The worst isn't the symptoms, but the fact that you can SEE this is an ILL child. That something really is wrong. But when you try to tell someone, they all say ""oh, but it's normal to not feel well after anaesthesia"". Yeah. I know. But this was different. The first time, he was a small child of 2-3 years old, and we thought that he must've come down with a bug unrelated to the fact that he had anaesthesia. Just by chance having it at the same time as he wokes up from anaesthesia. The second time it was very fishy to see the exact same progression of symptoms. But again, I thought he must've came down with a bug at the same time as the procedure, or that maybe the pipe down his throat was to blame. He was 4. Then, age 6, he was really, really ill. We wrote it partly off due to the fact that he had pulmonary hypertension and an enlarged heart. But still, it really bothered us seeing him so very, very ill. So whenever someone just mentions a possible gastroscopy, we back-pedalled. We just didn't want to face the anaesthesia again. Our instinct was to protect our child, and putting him through anaesthesia went through everything we knew was good for him. Our instincts screamed. But we knew at some stage it just simply HAD to be done, so when this dr said it's needed, we told her about our fears and experiences. So she asked us to get a list of all the medications used in his previous anaesthesia. I didn't even think it possible, but all 3 doctors came through for us. And when we presented the newest anaesthesiologist with the list, he said he believe that it's the gas that makes Monkeyman so ill. After the gastroscopy, the gastro-enterologist came to talk to us for quite a while. She's such a sweet, caring doctor. Anyway, she said that the anaesthesiologist believes that Monkeyman may have Malignant Hyperthermia. She said it 3 times! Accentuating it. Sounds like the anaestheliologist really wanted us to know that he thinks that's what it is. Which makes sense to me, when I googled it. Malignant really does mean Malignant! It scares me big time, but at the same time I have this huge relief in me! One less puzzle to try and figure out!! A possible diagnoses. Basically, it means that a gene on one chromosome mutated, and makes the body unable to handle gas (inhalant) anaesthesia. The body basically kills itself within hours. Fortunately, Monkeyman haven't had a bad case of it (yet). Just the start of the symptoms, like the fever and exhaustion and nausea. He must just never, ever get gas again, then he'll be fine. Also, no cocaine, ecstasy or such. Which I don't really see as a concern at this point. ;-) I know it'll be strange for people to understand the relief of knowing my child probably has malignant hyperthermia. But we had this sword hanging over our heads, fearing Monkeyman's next anaesthesia. It feels like we have removed that sword now. It's an enemy we could deal with, and we dealt with it. It makes me happy and relieved and grateful. Makes sense? So, how was Monkeyman after the gastroscopy? Well, he was confused for about 30 minutes directly after the operation. He fought and tangled all the wires something terrible. Then he woke up properly, watched tv for an hour, ate, stood up and walked out of the hospital. :-) Such a trooper!!! No nausea until late the night. No vomitting. No fever. Unfortunately, still the runny nose, clogged sinusses and red and teary eye. So, so much better, but not all symptoms gone. No lying down all day, no abnormal tiredness, nothing. He ate and drank normally, unlike the previous times. Just a normally tired little boy who had 30 minutes of anaesthesia. Really just NORMAL. Of course, he only got IV anaesthesia, not gas. But he barely flinched when they put the IV in, so all-in-all, such an easy child. He asked for daddy to go in with him!!! I was really so happy about that. It's wonderful to see their bond. And I had more than my share of seeing my babies made to sleep. The only thing is now just this runny nose and teary eye and clogged sinusses. Why would anaesthesia do that to him? Is it still an allergy? Is it a reaction similar to the malignent hyperthermia? Is it because his immune system is lower than the average child? The gastro-enterologist was very happy with everything during the operation. She found no structural abnormalities like constriction or growths or such. No clear signs of issues, except that the stomach was quite red. Abnormally, but non-specific red. She took biopsies of the throat, tummy and intestine. She also took a lot of bloods. She's gonna get a new baseline for him, since the last ones was over a year ago. And then when she was done, the ph doctor inserted the ph study while he was still under, so that he was saved that trauma at least (thank goodness for caring doctors). He didn't like the little pipe at all. It bothered him quite a bit. As much as it did me. Shame man. But again, he was a trooper. I kept him at home, and after 24 hours we went to the ph doctor to take it out. She only gave us some prelimenary results, she'll send the full report to the GE dr. The news wasn't good. :-( Even despite being on high doses of meds 2x a day already, he STILL had a positive GERD test. He refluxed 40x during the day and 20x during the night. 7 of those events didn't just rise up into the throat, but the contends of the stomach (very little acid due to the medication) moved right into his mouth. Poor little boy. No wonder he complains about nausea, and aspirated his stomach contends when he was on less medication. So ya, our hopes of lowering his medication dossage was dashed. She said we simply cannot do that to him. It will damage his lungs to the point where it can kill him. :-( She said after 10-20 years of aspiration, it looks like smokers lungs. Now we wait for the GE's call next week, to tell us what the biopsies and bloods shows, and her opinion on the reflux report. Ah well. I'm so good with waiting these days. ;-) Boeboe's long road has taught me at least that, hahaha. No really, I'm ok with the waiting. I remember how I used to complain on this blog about the waiting. But I've come a long, long way. I have learned patience and perserverance. And I know nothing ever gets to the point of being ""fixed"". So no point in being impatient. It's not a destination, it's a road with rest-stops along the way. Maybe, come to think about it, that was the lesson I needed to learn? Maybe that answers the why? So many people have asked or mentioned this past few years how come one family could have so many little rare issues they deal with? Well, maybe that was so that I could reach this point of acceptance, and just founding the joy in the here and now. Enjoying every day we as a family have together.",0

The cause of death was heart failure. He was 83 years old. Known as Hansi, Prince Johann Georg was a renowned fine art expert. He was the Director General of the Bavarian State Picture Collection from 1992 and also 1998 and also served for many years as the director of Hypo-Kunsthalle, a part of the Hypo Cultural Foundation in Munich. He was the sixth of seven children of HH Friedrich, Prince of Hohenzollern and HRH Princess Margarete, daughter of King Friedrich August III of Saxony and Archduchess Luise of Austria. HSH Prince Johann Georg Carl Leopold Eitel-Friedrich Meinrad Maria Hubertus Michael of Hohenzollern was born at Sigmaringen on July 31, 1932. He married HRH Princess Birgita of Sweden, second child of HRH Hereditary Prince Gustav Adolf of Sweden and HH Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

My son started developing migraines approx. 5 months ago. He would get a normal headache here and there but then started getting migraines with vomiting. He has had ct scans, mri's, eeg's and numerous blood tests. I started giving him 2 alleves the last time he had one and it did ward it off. He has had around 6 bad migraines with vomiting within the last 5 months. One night he woke up and said ""my head, my head"", vomited and then went back to sleep. The last 2, he gets white as a ghost, very bad pain in the head, vomits and then after sleeps for approx. 4 hours. His head doesn't feel OK for a day or two after the migraine but the pain does stop. Brought him to a pediatric neurologist who did all the tests and she pretty much said, give him motrin and write a diary. Motrins do nothing to help. He is not changing his diet, since he is a pretty picky eater, nothing else different. He is a bit high strung and I think external stimuli (noise, smells, bright light) do bring on headaches in him. Looking for another doctor that might be able to give him stronger medication or something to prevent them. Any one else have this issue? Thank you Click to expand... I saw that you thought you found the issue. However, if he keeps having migraines, I would suggest having an echo. When I was in high school, I started developing severe migraines to the point that I would pass out. It kept up, and I eventually developed some other symptoms (rapid heart beat, etc.) I spent literally years of doctors telling me it was stress from school, or not enough water, or exercise-induced asthma, or my thyroid before I found a doctor that would listen and sent me to a cardiologist. It turned out I had a congenital heart defect and and was heading into heart failure in my early 30's. After I had open heart surgery to correct the defect, I rarely get migraines anymore (only when they are triggered by my scent allergy to specific things).",1

Another example of what I cite as a huge factor in rising costs. A perfect example of this BS is the Beta-Blocker standard. When I was using ether a resident, it was common practice to hold beta blockers (Inderal, eg) for two weeks before elective surgery. These meds, though lowering blood pressure, also ""depressed"" the heart, and along with general anesthetics, that could lead to heart failure or worse. Then...some time in the 90's, a study showed that continuing beta-blockers was beneficial! So, for the last 15 years, I've had to tick a checkbox that either the patient took his beta-blocker, or I administered it intravenously. If I didn't give it, I had to document why. Guess what? Quote n the 2014 joint guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology and European Society of Anesthesiology (ESC/ESA), the new recommendations state that beta-blockers are not recommended in patients without clinical risk factors, given that the drugs do not decrease the risk of cardiac complications and ""may even increase this risk."" A retrospective cohort study also suggested beta-blockers in these low-risk patients might increase the risk of death.""

Hospital, Paris, has implanted more SynCardia Total Artificial Hearts than any other medical center in the world.","by AZBio World?s Leading Artificial Heart Center, La Piti? Hospital, Paris, Celebrates 30 Years and 249 Implants of the SynCardia Total Artificial Heart In 1986, under the pioneering leadership of Prof. Christian Cabrol, La Piti? performed the first Total Artificial Heart implantation in France and has implanted more SynCardia Total Artificial Hearts than any other medical center in the world. La Piti? accounts for 16% of the 1,586 SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart (TAH-t) implants and those of its direct predecessors. France is responsible for 357, or 23% of all TAH-t implants worldwide. Prof. Christian Cabrol implanted the first Total Artificial Heart in France on Sunday, April 13, 1986 at La Piti?- Salp?tri?re Hospital. He also performed the first heart transplant in Europe (1968) and the first heart-lung transplant (1982). The leadership and work of La Piti??s Cabrol, Prof. Alain Pavie and Prof. Pascal Leprince are recognized worldwide for their major contributions to cardiac surgery and patient care. La Piti? accounts for 16% of the 1,586 SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart (TAH-t) implants and those of its direct predecessors. France is responsible for 357, or 23% of all TAH-t implants worldwide. Currently, SynCardia TAH-t implants in France are conducted at 13 SynCardia Certified Centers. The country logged a 71% increase in SynCardia Heart implantations in 2015 over 2014. While the SynCardia Heart was developed in the United States, it has been the work of La Piti? that helped further refine use of the device, patient-care protocol and recovery,? says Michael P. Garippa, President and CEO of SynCardia Systems. ?La Piti??, Bad Oeynhausen and Duisburg in Germany have mentored Top SynCardia Certified Centers worldwide.? Leprince directs SynCardia Heart implantations at La Piti?. On December 23, 2014 he implanted the first 50cc TAH-t in the world which is the smaller version 70cc SynCardia Total Artificial Heart. Early worldwide statistics and historical data reveal that the percentage of females receiving a 50cc SynCardia Heart is over 500% greater than females getting the larger 70cc SynCardia TAH-t. Pediatric patients, ages 21 and under, represent 11% of 50cc TAH-t implants. This is 175% more than the number of pediatric patients who make up 4% of all implants of the 70cc TAH-t. Though the 50cc numbers are small, they demonstrate significant trends. The new 50cc SynCardia TAH-t is approved for use in Europe through the CE Mark and separately by Health Canada. The 50cc is available in the United States through an FDA-approved Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) clinical study and for compassionate or emergency use at SynCardia Certified Centers. (CAUTION ? In the United States, the 50cc SynCardia Total Artificial Heart is an investigational device, limited by United States law to investigational use.) Like a heart transplant, the TAH-t is the only approved device that eliminates end-stage biventricular (both sides) heart failure. This fatal condition results when the native heart?s two ventricles can no longer pump enough blood for a patient to survive. Together, the 70cc and 50cc versions make SynCardia TAH-t technology available to almost all adults and more adolescents. The weight of a human heart varies by body size and gender. It ranges between 250 and 350+/- grams. The 70cc and 50cc SynCardia Hearts each weigh less than 250 grams. The SynCardia TAH-t and its direct predecessors are by far the most used total artificial hearts in the world. Of the 1,649 implants representing 13 designs from 1969 through April 7, 2016, the SynCardia accounts for 96% of all Total Artificial Heart implants. About the SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart SynCardia Systems, Inc. in Tucson, Arizona is a medical technology company focused on developing and manufacturing the SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart (TAH-t). The SynCardia TAH-t is an implantable system designed to assume the full function of a failed human heart in patients suffering from end-stage biventricular (both sides) heart failure. The SynCardia TAH-t is the only total artificial heart that is commercially available in the United States, European Union and Canada for use as a bridge to donor heart transplantation. More than 1,580 implants of the SynCardia Total Artificial Heart account for over 530 patient years of life on the device. Since January 2012 more than 600 SynCardia Hearts have been implanted. The youngest patient to receive a SynCardia Heart was 9 years old; the oldest was 80 years old. The longest a patient has lived with a SynCardia Heart and received a successful donor heart transplant was nearly four years (1,373 days). SynCardia Systems also manufactures the Freedom? portable driver, which powers the SynCardia Heart while allowing clinically stable patients to be discharged from the hospital and live at home and in their communities. The Freedom? portable driver has been used by more than 275 patients, accounting for over 180 patient years of support. Media Contact: U.S.A.",0

So we sigh, and pick up our buckets, and shift a little up the shore, only to have the waves soon reach our toes again. The tide that threatens to pull us out if we stay frozen. I'll never forget the first time I got swept. The doctor said my blood clot was large. The biggest he'd ever seen. But, I had a newborn baby. But, I was only 36. But, I really wasn't ready... They said it could be fatal, and suddenly their eyes looked at me different. As I called my family to tell them they needed to come, I looked at a picture of my four daughters. Before long, as they whisked me away to the hospital, I prayed, ""Please, God. Let me be back to raise them."" At that time, while I was terror stricken, the doctors implanted a metal filter in my main vein leading to my lungs to prevent any clots from breaking off and traveling there to kill me. I remember being awake as they threaded a tiny metal basket down through my neck, through my heart, down into my abdomen. A safety net, they told me. Until I formed another clot above it, And that clot became fear in the form of my own body. The months after that were beyond harrowing. I was scared to be alone in case I collapsed and the kids were left alone. I was scared to drive, for fear that they clot would travel, and kill me, and I'd cause an accident in the process. I was literally scared to move. I had talks with the girls about how much I loved them. They needed to always know. Talks with Justin about if he was faced with raising them alone. Please be gentle. Please surround them with loving women. Please remind them of me. Fitting everything you want to say in is even harder than it sounds. Constant appointments, several ambulance rides, blood tests, genetics testing, all to later find that the reason I'd gotten the clot in the first place was because of a cluster of events including a genetic condition called Factor V Leiden. My body, once triggered to clot, would have a difficult time shutting off that process. A chain effect. But, even though that was the most terrible time in my life, through God's grace, I recovered. Slowly, and timidly. Nervous to put my toes back in the water. The girls grew. I was grateful to be there to watch it, and never took it for granted. Time marched on, but never far from the ""What ifs"" of if it ever happened again. The fear has stifled. Imprisoned. Taunted. It has whispered to me in dark rooms, and been my alarm clock many mornings. I had just started getting counseling for what my therapist thought was PTSD from it, when suddenly, a month ago, completely out of the blue and four years almost to the day, I felt that familiar pain again, and the panic returned. Surely it was just anxiety. Surely I just needed to breathe deeper. Calm my thoughts. Surely. But, unable to let it go, I called the doctor, and almost collapsed when after an ultrasound they told me I had a clot once again. The room spun, I rung my hands, I can barely remember leaving that place. HOW could this be my path again? God, didn't I suffer enough? And the waves were up to my waist. Fear had returned with his ugly face to whisper, ""See. I told you so. You'll never be able to get away. I own you."" But as fear tried once again to take over, God's voice reminded me that what Satan lays out for evil, God re-weaves for good. Now I've had weeks of tests, blood work, and appointments. Back to the same seat in the clinic waiting room that still somehow feels warm from when I left. The doctor, in order to verify there was no further clotting up higher, ordered a CT scan. He said ""just to be sure."" I went, and I shook, and tears dripped into my ears as I lay there on my back being prepped. I prayed in that tube staring up at the light painted to look like a beautiful sky. As if a painted cherry blossom and a cloud was going to calm me. I was done soon enough, and I went home. And then I waited. And waited. And waited. A week went by with no word. Surely that was good news, right? Surely they would have contacted me by now if something was there they weren't expecting. By this Friday I was praying a prayer of thanks as I pulled into my mom's group at church. Thankful for the grace of each new day. Thankful for what was obviously good. But then I got the message. The CT scan results had not showed any further clotting, but incidentally had seen fluid around my heart. A note said I needed to call my cardiologist right away. The message said, ""Try not to worry."" It should have also said, ""Definitely do NOT Google."" But of course I did, and the findings were so SCARY that the water around me looked like mud. There are many reasons one could develop fluid around their heart, and many different levels. You could have a small effusion, caused by a virus, or illness, You could have a medium sized one caused from trauma or autoimmune issue, or, in the worst scenario, you could have a large effusion that could be life threatening, and often had a very high mortality rate, caused from cancer, or bleeding from the heart. Surely mine was a small, then, I told myself. I felt OK. They would have called me to come in right away if it were more serious, right? I spent my weekend in on/off fear. Crying often. Laughing some. Thinking constantly. The waves slowly moving up further, and Now around my neck. This morning before I could even call her, the phone rang. It was my cardiologist. Her voice sounded serious as she laid out the next steps to diagnose the whys of this new finding. I'd need an echocardiogram and some blood work to start. Once they figured out the reason and actual amount of fluid, they would know how to treat it. She said she had seen the report, but would need to know more before she could know how to move forward. And then I asked it. Even though I didn't want to. I asked ""What size are we talking? I've been looking online."" And she said the thing I didn't even think could be. ""Well, it looks like it's large."" And now I was underneath. The undertow was so strong. Heels pitched above my head. She said words after that I barely heard, other than to go to the ER if I wanted to expedite things and not wait any more days to begin being treated. So I went. Barely able to move my eyes side to side. I knew from my reading that sometimes the large effusions are caused by Warfarin, which I'm on for the clot. That often in that case the fluid they are seeing is blood. That it makes it very complicated to even know how to treat because the blood thinners make the fluid dangerous to drain because you could bleed out, but to go off of my blood thinners at this point could cause wide spread clotting from the Factor V, which could also kill me. From the minute I got to the hospital it was clear my doctor had called ahead. I was taken in quickly, and by a half an hour later, I had had an EKG, an IV started, 11 tubes of blood taken, blood pressure cuff placed, history gone over, and a chest x-ray done. The nurse entered and said that what they were concerned about was an enzyme indicating impending heart failure. That I would most likely be admitted soon. The doctor came in and repeated what the nurse had said, with the addition of indicating I'd most likely be undergoing a trans-esophageal echo, which would require sedation and was an in-patient procedure. *Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death* I asked to please use the bathroom, and when I closed myself in, I stood and begged God. I begged for a miracle. And then I heard it: ""Be anxious for nothing, but in all things with prayer and thanksgiving, make your requests known to God."" I was forgetting the thanksgiving. Because isn't that just what Satan loves? To draw our eyes, and hearts away from the good that we've been granted to pull us into something that stifles? To call from the dark bushes, ""Hey! Look over here!"" With thanksgiving.... Thankful that they'd at least caught this. Thankful for a quick moving diagnosis. Thankful I knew that no matter what was about to come, He held all of my days in HIs hands and nothing could separate me from them. I went back to the room where my mom waited, looking concerned. I asked her if she'd pray specifically for complete healing. Specifically, I said, for the issue to disappear. Those were the words. And then something happened. Five minutes later, The doctor appeared with something in his hands. ""Do you want the good news, or the bad news?"" He said. ""Not the bad,"" I replied, covered in tape, and tubes, and monitors. ""I really don't want the bad news at all."" ""Well, that's good,"" he said. ""Because there isn't really any."" I held my breath. What was he about to say? He said he didn't really know how, but there appeared to have been... a typo? That it looked like the report had eluded to a large pericardial effusion, but that for some reason there was no mention of it in the conclusion portion of the report he was seeing. He said it should have been highlighted as the number one thing, but it wasn't even mentioned. He thought this was strange when reading it, so he had asked to have the scans sent to him, and he had called in the hospital radiologist to help him review them. He said that after looking at the scans carefully, they both agreed that not only was the effusion not large, but there was NO evidence of ANY fluid around my heart, and my heart was perfectly healthy. I could hear the second hand tick. Silence. Could this even BE?! Furthermore, he said, there was also no evidence of additional clotting, and my filter was still in place. I was free to go home. A gasp above the surface. I cried in that moment like a crazy person. Sobbing. Laughing. Laugh sobbing. And that went on for over an hour, as the doctor, and nurses, and techs came in to say they just couldn't believe it, and congratulations. I heard him calling my doctors with the news. And suddenly I was laying on the shore. Clothes wet. Face down. But alive, and grateful that sometimes when the tide is pushing in, it's bringing you back in with it. Because He asks us to trust and keep our eyes fixed, and He will quiet the storm. Because ""Never fails"" actually means NEVER. God did a miracle for me today. In my physical heart, and in the heart at my core. The one from where my real life stems. Two doctors had seen that report and been alarmed enough to have me admitted. But suddenly, There was nothing there. The beautiful sky I was looking up at was the real one. Because He perfects all that which concerns us. Because the promise is that though we walk through the fire, we will not be burned. I lift my eyes up to the mountains. Where does my help come from? It comes from the maker of heaven and earth. The maker of hearts, and blood, and bodies. From the maker of futures. The maker of a plan for me, And the one who sets my feet over and over on solid ground. I don't know what is planned for me because of the strength I've gained through these things. I don't know the people I'll meet who might need to hear that I've been there, too, and made it out alive, and they will too. I don't know what lies over the dunes and out into the world beyond this ocean of trial. What I do know is that my faith was strengthened today after seeing that I have faced fear, and possible death multiple times, and each time have been spared, and ever moved up to the dry parts of the shore.",1

I have a plate in my neck with 4 or more screws holding my spinal canal off my spinal cord. I'm supposed to go in for major back surgery for rods and screw to be put in to my back.  I've had a block in my colon and part of it removed. I have pancreatitis and am in a lot of pain. I have one kidney (from birth) on my right side which I get a lot of bladder/kidney infections cause I have only one tube exiting from my kidney. I have Factor Five Liden, a blood clotting disorder that has cause a Pulmonary Embolism. I have bleeding ulcers that cannot be treated cause I ended up in a 1 week coma with my family being told there was no hope of regaining consciousness. But I did, and there's no harder job in life than trying to get well. I was not able walk, talk, write, went from 150 to 115 in a matter of about a few weeks as well as I lost all my hair. I've had confusion, blankness and scared especially when I get infections, cause I can be driving in the most familiar area and I get so scared cause I don't know where I am, so now my license has been taking away here and there. I'm told that the fluid and swelling from the coma was so traumatic that I may never be where I was before it. Along with SLE Lupus, I am fighting DRESS syndrome which is a fatal allergic drug reaction if not caught in time. It happened because having lupus, I had an endoscopy done, in I think February 2015, where bleeding ulcers were found and I was put on ulcer antibiotics and that's what put me in the coma along with unbelievable burning rash from my head to my toes. It burned so bad and was so painful just trying to take a bath or shower was horrible. My heart, I stay in heart failure almost all the time, due to SLE Lupus and Cardiomyopathy. I fight weakness more than I've had to any time of my life. Of course I am tired a lot just from Lupus, but I now recognize when my heart is giving me problems. I'm tired and am extremely weak and to make it from my bed to my bathroom is extremely hard! I had to use a walker after the coma, they wanted me to use a wheelchair, then I guess I said no cause I got myself to a cane for many months and got tired of having to carry that around, that I was determined to get rid of that to. I was told to go into a nursing home, but I'm so independent that it scared me. So I thought that there was nothing else I could do but to get better and fight. I still have a lot of problems that send me to the doctors that I've had to see, neurologists, Rheumatologist, cardiologists, endocrinologist. I have problems with swallowing, even just water, I choke on. It gets lounged in my throat and is hard and scary to clear. The cancer of my thyroid, caused me to loose my thyroid and be on levothyroxine and those are a very small pill, but I have choked so many times trying to take them. I am an anemic because I have had a lot of bleeding in my urine and they're not sure from where. I am on prescription Iron pills but even with those i still am anemic. I have a hard time breathing at times cause my lungs are not as strong any more due to cardiomyopathy and Pleurisy.  I have found myself fighting every day more than ever, with having to be on pneurontins, to help me rest and meds to try to keep rashes, clotting, swelling, breathing, exhaustion and many other stuff away. I have a now 17 year old son, whom turned 16 in Sept. 2014 and was forced to become from a child, to a teen to a boy and a parent, all in a matter of a very few months. I'm living cause of my son, my sister, and my brother and a very dear friend whom works but never cared of the time when she was called by my family that I was in the e.r., she comes out right away and never has left me till I left the e.r. or was put into a room. The time never mattered to her, all hours of the night and very early mornings, she was there. My son has saved my life so many times, I can't count. I never knew when or how but, he many many times have had to call 911, after talking to my sister, cause I'd fall out of bed, not know where I am, go completely blank without me knowing and in doing this a lot in the past year, he was calling 911 at least once a week for a long time. I'd wake up in my bed scared and would call my sister and ask her why did I have a hospital band on and places where it looked like iv sites. She'd tell me and it's the most scariest thing in life, to have no clue where, what or who you have seen every day. My son was the parent taking care of me, it didn't stop for him just there, he fixed my food, helped me to the bathroom, got my drinks and everyday got my meds together. My 16 year old was not a teen but thrown into being a parent that he didn't want to loose. He is my biggest angel on earth!, he now is 17 and will be graduating this June. I wanted to buy him a $7000, car so bad a few months ago, but knew that I cannot afford for him. I just wanted to say thanking for his, tears, love, care and prayers, cause I would not be here at all without him taking care of his mom! I didn't and couldn't get him anything, but my heart hurts cause I can't help him now.  My ex walked out from my (our) son and I cause of having an affair and didn't want me complaining to him that I was sick all the time. When I asked him about Morgan, and support, my ex responded to me that it was my problem, he didn't care! But,  I took care of my ex, helped him for about 20 years build a meaningful career by paying for him to go to school, not work and then helped him get a govt contracting job, I was forgotten about and he walked away from his son and me, once he got the higher pay.  I am on disability and have been since 2004. Through the years, I have gotten Social Security and a long term disability check. But I have not had a wage increase several times and I am having a very hard to now meeting my bills, more than ever. I have $35 in the bank today and won't get my Social Security check till next Wednesday. I get it every 3rd Wednesday of each month. I have an old 88 Toyota truck, no payments but is breaking down some and a 2014 Camaro.  Having the Camaro gives me comfort in knowing that I can get to doctor appointments, without breaking down. I purchased my very small 900 square home in I think 2007, on my own, . after my ex father in law didn't want it anymore cause we had been renting from him since 1996. My ex did not want to buy it with me and has spread rumors around that I owed him money from it. My lawyer laughed at him and said that he walked out of his son and wife's life and he refused to be on the loan and I didn't owe him one cent. My monthly payment is $837.00, which includes $200/extra to pay for the insurance and property taxes every year, so it's actually about $637/month.  But I am scared, I can't move cause there's no where you can rent a 2 bedroom place anymore for this 800/month. I need help paying for my electric and water, usually together about $200/month. I have many times tried to get help, but not allowed cause there's only my son and I and with the SS and long term disability check, I cannot get help.  I don't know where or who to turn to. Can you please help me or guide me. I owe $33,000 on the car and realize that the payment is high, but I want to work and never will be allowed again, and am pleading for help of where I can turn. I'm very very scared and frightened to continue going backwards. I want to work so I don't have to ask for help, but the drs have said I never could again.  I have worked so hard especially with just starting to get my hair back and have gained weight to where the doctors say that if I were to go into another coma, my weight will help. This has taken over a year to gain both. But the drs are worried that I can fall into a coma again at anytime because my body is still fighting and is weak. I cannot talk at times now, I slur my words, reading is hard and writing is very hard cause though I know what I want to write I have to struggle writing the letters. My hearing is going and pray to God every day for help and a small miracle cause I don't know how I can continue on with no monetary help which is stressing me horribly! I'm pleading to find monetary help, cause everything is getting costlier but my pay is about the same since 2004. Please, I've tried everywhere for help and always turned down.  I have $35.00 in my bank, I have no savings and this is all I have till next Wednesday, for my son and I.  May I please get help and guidance on where I can turn! Please. Thank you so much! Sincerely, Ren? (540)219-3413""",1

Read those two articles you just posted, holy shit... Quote Symptoms of [diverticulitis] include; fever, lower left abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea. Quote The most common symptoms of a bicuspid aortic valve are: Shortness of breath, during exercise or when you are lying in bed Constant tiredness or fatigue Coughing at night or when in bed Rapid or fluttering heart palpitations Swollen ankles Chest pain (tightness, angina) Feeling dizzy But Brock's poor little tummy hurt I've probably told you this before, but just because you want something to be true, that doesn't mean that it's true. Diverticulitis is nowhere near as serious a health issue as a bicuspid aortic valve--and that's not even mentioning the other serious heart conditions struve had, including an enlarged heart and a leaking valve, which could lead to sudden heart failure... The worst thing about Brock's disease was the possibility of infection, which didn't happen. Struve was blacking out in his house after training and couldn't breath right while Brock had a belly ache and couldn't poop right. Most people with a bicuspid aortic valve are diagnosed at age 4-5 when they start becoming more physically active because it makes it very difficult for them to keep up with other kids while playing soccer. Not only did Struve keep running around like all the other kids, the man became a professional fighter, got to the ufc, and fucking knocked out the current heavyweight champion with 2/3 a regular human heart, ha what a weak faggot, right? You said that he had heart surgery in 2013, but that's not true. He opted out of surgery because they probably wouldn't have let him fight with a titanium tube in his fuckin heart lol. His heart shrank back down to normal size, but he still has a bicuspid aortic valve, that's not something you get better from, it's not like his heart can up and decide to create a new valve suddenly. Stefan Struve is a fucking badass, every day that he gets out of bed and goes to training he's overcoming more adversity than you've probably seen in your life. Quit talking shit about people you know nothing of.",0

Respiratory Disease Respiratory Disease is defined as medical conditions, affecting the breathing organ and tissues including Inflammatory lung disease, Obstructive lung diseases, Restrictive lung diseases, Respiratory tract infections, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli, the nerves and muscles breathing , etc,. Pleural disease: Pleural effusion The pleura is a thin tissue covered by a layer of cells (mesothelial cells) that surrounds the lungs and lines the inside of the chest wall. Pleural effusion is a condition of collection of fluid within the pleural cavity as a result of heart failure, bleeding (hemothorax), infections, excessive or decreased fluid volume, etc. Types of Pleural effusion Depending to fluid accumulations B.1.1. Hydrothorax Pleural effusion as a result of Serous fluid accumulation. In many case, it is a result of cirrhosis. According to the study by the Harvard Medical School, patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension often have abnormal extracellular fluid volume regulation, resulting in accumulation of fluid as ascites, oedema or pleural effusion. These complications carry a poor prognosis with nearly half of the patients with ascites dying in the ensuing 2-3 years(1). Other cases may be result as a complicating peritoneal dialysis. According to the study by The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hydrothorax complicating continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) appears in approximately 2% of all patients(2). B.1.2. Dyspnea Pleural effusion as a result of blood accumulation within the pleural cavity. In most cases, it is a result from a injury to the thorax resulting to ruptured blood to spill into the pleural space. According to the study by the Medical Centre Alkmaar, haemothorax is a problem commonly encountered in medical practice and is most frequently related to open or closed chest trauma or to invasive procedures of the chest(3).There is a report of two cases where seemingly insignificant low-energy trauma precipitated massive haemothoraces in elderly patients with underlying osteoporosis, ultimately resulting in their immediate causes of death(4) and a case of haemothorax is described which occurred after the removal of a small pig-tail chest tube (8.5 F) that was inserted in the second intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line, for primary spontaneous pneumothorax management(5). B.1.3. Chylothorax Pleural effusion as a result of lymphatic fluid accumulation within the pleural cavity. 1. Chylothorax congenital According to the study of University of Erlangen-Nuernberg, Chylothorax after surgery on congenital heart disease in newborns and infants may appear due to injury of the thoracic duct, due to venous or lymphatic congestion, central vein thrombosis, or diffuse injury of mediastinal lymphatic tissue in association with secondary chest closure(6). Other in the study of Chylothorax after congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair indicated that severity of preoperative cardiopulmonary derangement and not anatomical or technical factors predicts chylothorax occurrence after CDH repair(7). 2. Acquired chylothorax a. Postoperative chylothorax Chylothorax may also be a rare but severe complication of thoracic and esophageal surgery. At an early stage, chylothorax can lead to severe cardiorespiratory and volemic complications. In case of chronicization, malnutrition and immunologic complications can occur, responsible for a mortality rate of up to 50%(8). b. Tumors Chylothorax in paediatric age is a life-threatening clinical entity that cause serious respiratory, nutritional and immunologic complications. Chylothorax in the absence of trauma or tumour is uncommon and lymphangiomatosis of the bone, although extremely rare, has been associated with these condition, according to the study by Azienda ospedaliera-Universit? di Padova(9), B.1.4. Pleural empyema (Pyothorax) Pleural effusion as a result of accumulation of pus within the pleural cavity. According to the study by the Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Pyothorax-associated lymphoma (PAL) is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma of exclusively B-cell phenotype developing in the pleural cavity of patients after more than 20-year history of pyothorax resulting from an artificial pneumothorax for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis or tuberculous pleuritis.10). They also report a rare case of an 82-year-old woman with pain on the left side of the chest a PAL with dual genotype, i.e., simultaneous immunoglobin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TcR) gene rearrangement(11).

ACE stands for angiotensin converting enzyme. Lisinopril is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) or congestive heart failure. It is also used to improve survival after a heart attack. Mechanism Of Action Renin, synthesized by the kidneys, is released into the circulation where it acts on a plasma precursor to produce angiotensin I, which is converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that also causes release of aldosterone from the adrenals. Lisinopril blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to decreased BP, decreased aldosterone secretion, a small increase in serum potassium levels, and sodium and fluid loss. Indications 1. Hypertension 2. Congestive Heart Failure 3. Myocardial Infarction 4. Diabetic Nephropathy Contraindication 1. Kidney disease (or if you are on dialysis) 2. Liver disease 3. Diabetes 4. High levels of potassium in your blood.

The Fresno State wrestler learned the school was dropping the sport, a victim of Title IX and budget considerations. After Bulldogs coaches broke the devastating news, Halsey and his teammates were left to figure out where to finish their college careers. It was like a punch in the stomach. Brandon Halsey, on Fresno State dropping wrestling in 2006 ?It was like a punch in the stomach,? Halsey said. ?What am I going to do now?? Halsey transferred to Cal State Bakersfield, where he wrestled from 2007 to 2009. Then he turned his focus to mixed martial arts, eventually signing with Bellator in 2012. And that has brought Halsey full circle. The middleweight will take a 9-1 record back to Save Mart Center, where the Bulldogs wrestling team competed, against John Salter (11-3) on Friday night in Bellator 156. Preliminary fights begin at 4:45 p.m., with the main portion at 6 p.m. (tape-delayed on the West Coast at 9 p.m. on Spike TV). ?Great to be back in the Valley and be back in fight action at the Save Mart Center,? Halsey said. ?I wrestled against Illinois there back in 2006.? With the Bulldogs, Halsey was 3-2 in 2004-05 but finished the season as a redshirt. In 2005-06, he was 2-3 while dealing with injuries. Halsey was 28-9 for the Roadrunners in 2006-07 and won a Pacific-10 championship. After sitting out 2007-08, Halsey finished seventh at the 2009 NCAA Division I national championships at 197 pounds. While Halsey mulled his next move, friends suggested MMA. He said, why not? Cal Poly hosted a ?Fight for Wrestling? MMA fundraiser at Mott Gym, spearheaded by World Extreme Cagefighting co-founder Scott Adams and supported by UFC legend Chuck Liddell. Halsey participated and afterward was invited to train with Bellator?s Quinton ?Rampage? Jackson and UFC?s Michael Bisping in Huntington Beach. ?I moved down there, and the rest is history,? he said. ?Here I am fighting for Bellator.? Halsey signed in 2012 but put his debut on hold until 2013 after a bike accident left him needing reconstructive shoulder surgery. Save Mart Center has hosted several Bellator events, but none with Halsey. He expects to have plenty of support Friday, including ex-Bulldogs coach Dennis DeLiddo, who on Wednesday watched Halsey work out at Fresno?s Dethrone Mixed Martial Arts. He?s a good kid. He had a career in amateur wrestling before transitioning into MMA. Former Fresno State wrestling coach Dennis DeLiddo, on Brandon Halsey ?I keep in touch with him quite a bit,? DeLiddo said. ?He?s a good kid.? Halsey said wrestlers adjust well to MMA ?because they have that ? foundation of balance and awareness and where their position is and to adapt to striking.? ?It?s like a dangerous mixture,? he said. Returning to the arena where he wrestled as a collegian has long been on Halsey?s mind. He plans to make the most of the chance, and it means that much more coming in the year Fresno State has hired a coach to reinstate the wrestling program. Bringing wrestling back to the Valley is going to be huge for MMA as well. Brandon Halsey ?It?s huge,? he said. ?This area, all through the Valley, it?s a fight town, too.

Cece was with me for only a few years, but she was my lil girl...my companion and when she left me I as devastated. But I had to be strong for pepper, and I had to force myself to move forward because I did not want my pepper to suffer like I was suffering. Find comfort in Your other pups, because I'm sure they need you as much as you need them. Get pictures of Pepe and put them around the house. I have pictures of my pups on the kitchen counter, I talk to pepper when I do dishes. I have his picture on my phone, its my wall paper.

The findings, published in the journal Cell Stem Cell, came from researchers from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. ?Our past work brought hope that we could one day improve heart function in people with heart failure by converting scar tissue into beating heart muscle,? said Li Qian, PhD, assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and the study?s senior author. ?But that was more of a proof-of-principle study, and the conversion rate was quite low. Now we have found the barrier to conversion, and by removing it, we have been able to significantly increase the yield of muscle-like cells.? Heart failure has no cure and currently affects an estimated 5.7 million people in the United States. Common symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling, all of which often worsen as the heart weakens over time. ?Our hope is that this approach could extend the lives of people with heart failure and markedly improve their quality of life in the future,? said Qian, who is also a member of the McAllister Heart Institute at UNC. In 2012, Qian and her colleagues created a ?cocktail? of proteins capable of converting fibroblasts, which create scar tissue, into cardiomyocytes ? heart muscle cells that beat on their own exactly the way regular heart muscle cells do. Notably, the team?s approach did not require converting fibroblasts into stem cells, which is typical of other tissue regeneration techniques. Qian?s approach lowered the likelihood of uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation. In experiments using mice, the cocktail proved successful at shrinking the size of scar tissue and improving heart function. But the process had remained disappointingly slow ? until now. ?We wanted to have a better yield and shorten the conversion time so in the future this process could be fast, easy, and efficient for disease modeling or for treatment,? Qian said. The new breakthrough came when the team discovered that a gene called Bmi1 interfered with the expression of other key genes needed to convert fibroblasts into heart muscle cells. Bmi1 previously had been investigated for its role in neural stem cells and cancer cells, but this is the first study to pinpoint a role in its interaction with cardiogenic genes. When the team depleted Bmi1, the conversion rate sped up markedly; the percentage of fibroblasts that transformed into heart muscle cells increased 10-fold. Repressing Bmi1 also allowed Qian?s team to simplify the cocktail by reducing the number of different proteins in it.",0

Where is the ?Kingdom of God?? Is the ?Kingdom of God? just another word or synonym in the Gospels for Heaven? ?The Kingdom of God? sparks many questions and rightly so. When searching the Gospels for ?Kingdom of God? or ?Kingdom of Heaven (which appears more often in the Gospel according to Saint Matthew),? one is amazed by the numerous references. Throughout the centuries, believers have pondered the meaning and implications of ?the Kingdom of God? and scholars certainly have grappled with the phrase and filled library shelves with volumes of thought-provoking commentaries. What can and must we do with the reality of ?the Kingdom? in our day? In 1975, Pope Paul VI penned the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi (On Evangelizing in our Day). Early in the Exhortation, the Bishop of Rome states: ?As an evangelizer, Christ first of all proclaims a kingdom, the kingdom of God; and this is so important that, by comparison, everything else becomes ?the rest,? which is ?given in addition.? Only the kingdom therefore is absolute and it makes everything else relative. The Lord will delight in describing in many ways the happiness of belonging to this kingdom (a paradoxical happiness which is made up of things that the world rejects), the demands of the kingdom and its Magna Charta, the heralds of the kingdom, its mysteries, its children, the vigilance and fidelity demanded of whoever awaits its definitive coming (Evangelii Nuntiandi, 8).? Clearly, Pope Paul VI sees ?the Kingdom of God? has the central experience of Jesus? Public Ministry; so central that everything in His ministry is grounded in ?the Kingdom.? Similarly, the Catechism of the Catholic Church (paragraphs 541 through 556) examines the manifold depth of ?the Kingdom? in Jesus? Public Ministry. Based on these texts as well as other Catechetical Documents, the Roman Missal and the Sacred Scriptures, I have compiled a working description (note: not a definition) of ?the Kingdom of God? that has been helpful to undergraduates, deacon candidates, seminarians and believers. There is certainly much room for discussion in this description and is in no way intended to be exhaustive. 1. ?The ?Kingdom of God? is God our Father intervening definitively in the created order.? The Kingdom is not necessarily or strictly a specific place, although ?place? will be a dimension of the Kingdom as a way of living. The Kingdom is a way of living, an ongoing activity initiated by God the Father in loving concern for beings that have been created in His image and likeness. We have become addicted to sin in such a way that we cannot break free from its grip by our own power. We have come to enjoy sin too much. Sin?s tentacles have woven deeply into our lives that often we cannot see or think clearly. We may from time-to-time have great desires to rid ourselves of sin, desires that are marvelous but desires that do not contain within themselves the power to effect what is desired. More often than not, however, sin has dulled our senses to Divine Love. Sin has numbed us into complacency and entitlement to the point that we even approach the things of God and Church from a selfish point of view with no regard to the life of faith as engagement with the Divine Persons who call me as an individual and as a community to ongoing conversion manifesting charity and service to the Body of Christ. So powerless over sin, so addicted to the false self we have become that an intervention is needed: the ?Kingdom of God.? 2. This intervention is a work of power, a power that transforms and surpasses the power of Creation. God the Father?s work is quintessentially a work of restoration, not annihilation. Ask anyone in construction and he or she will tell you that it is often easier to raze a building and start over than to renovate or restore. Renovating an existing structure that does not have a level, plumb or square line in it makes restoration tedious and time consuming, not to mention the ?surprises? lurking behind old plaster and lathe. Yet ask any restorer when the project is complete and most likely she or he will tell you that in spite of its challenges and frustrations, it was and continues to be a labor of love. Such is the Kingdom. Neither Creation nor humanity is destroyed. The Creator does not raze the created order and begin anew. Even though humanity makes continuous choices reinforcing the addiction to sin, the Father ? with eyes of loves ? gazes upon each human person in such a way that each of us are declared ?precious.? So precious are we in the sight of God the Father, that none of us are disposable, expendable or useless. Each of us has a particular vocation in the Father?s plan of salvation and our very being is so precious to the Father that the loving, transforming power of His Kingdom calls us from the addiction to our false selves to our true selves as icons of the Father?s love. 3. This transforming power becomes a way of living, hence not a specific ?place? that one can absolutely pinpoint. You cannot use Google Maps or a GPS device to find the Kingdom. The Kingdom is God the Father?s way of living. It is a way of living that is the Son, Jesus. He lives each moment of His life attentive to His Father?s word and will. Spending nights in communion with His Father, Jesus teaches with His life that Kingdom living is living joined, connected, related ? whatever words you wish to use ? to God the Father. As a way of living, the Kingdom is a radical embrace of the First Commandment: no one nor no thing nor anything we deem important comes before the Father or interferes with our relationship with Him. Kingdom living is life that provides the essentials to a sister or brother in need (Matthew 25) and celebrates, praise and thanks the Father for all that He is doing in life (cf. Luke 1, the Magnificat). It is in this sense that one can speak of the Kingdom as ?a place.? Wherever one is when living as the Father commands, there is the Kingdom. 4. The Kingdom, as a way of living, has been prepared by the prophets of Old. Many of the prophets called Israel to authentic worship, a message that is still quite valid despite present, misguided and weak arguments that attempt ? erroneously ? at a division between religion and spirituality. For the prophets, the spiritual relationship formed by the covenant necessarily bound one (religion) freely to observe and practice a continuous, ongoing change-of-heart. The prophets knew that the ?energy? required to live justly as a covenant person did not come from within a person by himself or herself. Such living depended upon the mercy of God celebrated and experienced in authentic worship. Such worship then propelled one to be an instrument of charitable service in the world acting, not on one?s own initiative and power, in the name of God. 5. The Kingdom, as a way of living, is now definitely revealed and embodied in Jesus. Here, all ambiguity concerning the Kingdom is erased. The Kingdom is essentially a Person, the Person Jesus: ?only He can lead us to the love of the Father in the Spirit and make us share in the life of the Holy Trinity (Catechism of the Catholic Church, paragraph 426).? The Incarnation makes the Kingdom a reality in the created order to effect the Father?s loving transformation of everything, most especially the human heart. Responding and living the love revealed to us in Christ Jesus is the essential work and live of the ?Kingdom of God.? Is there more to be said about the Kingdom? Certainly ? but more importantly the Kingdom is not intended for study but for living. While some of these reflections may give us some insight, such insight is always directed to worshipping God the Father and serving one another in the name of Jesus Christ with the gifts and power of the Holy Spirit. As Jesus? teaching on prayer is proclaimed today at Mass, consider ... I have thought that the ?Kingdom of God? is ... What does it mean to ?seek the Kingdom of God and His righteousness?? In view of the ?Kingdom of God,? I am thankful for ...? Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit: as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be forever. Amen Top",0

""Our study found that low levels of both total vitamin D and bioavailable vitamin D appear to be associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes,"" said lead author Heidi May, PhD, MSPH, a cardiovascular epidemiologist with the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute. The study evaluated 4,200 participants between the ages of 52 and 76. A quarter of the study participants were diabetic and 70 percent had coronary artery disease. Clinicians tested participants' vitamin D metabolite levels, which included components of vitamin D that are formed during metabolism, to determine the metabolites' association with future major adverse cardiovascular events. Bioavailable vitamin D results from vitamin D being absorbed into the blood stream without binding to surrounding proteins. During metabolism, only 10-15 percent of total vitamin D is available in the body to act on target cells, as most are bound to vitamin D binding proteins. Therefore, evaluating whether the proportion of vitamin D that can be used may be important, as only unbound vitamin D, such as bioavailable vitamin D, is available to act on target cells. The study tested many different types of vitamin D, but found that measuring total vitamin D and bioavailable vitamin D were the most accurate in predicting harmful cardiovascular events. ""This study is the first research that evaluates the association of vitamin D metabolites with cardiovascular events,"" said Dr. May. ""And evaluating usable vitamin D could mean the difference on the amount of vitamin D prescribed, if it's prescribed at all."" The study expands on the results of several observational studies, including some performed at Intermountain Healthcare, but researchers recommend conducting more studies on non-Caucasian populations because past research shows vitamin D metabolites affect Caucasian and non-Caucasian races differently. Results of the study will be presented at the American College of Cardiology Scientific Sessions in Chicago, on Saturday, April 2, at 2:45 p.m., CST.

The tired and drowsy can come from some medications, but also, tired and drowsy can come from COPD itself. Or breathing difficulties themselves, just by the fact of not getting good aeration of the lungs and perhaps, in your case, according to your medications you look to have some issues with the heart...these can all contribute. Are you abe to take any exercise and if so, what do you do for this? Also, in a previous post, you had mentioned not wearing your oxygen right on your face during the night...this concerns me as I am wondering if you are not keeping oxygen levels high enough during sleep...if it is not on your face or under your nose, there is no guarantee once you nod off that it would be adequate.

Vericel Corporation (NASDAQ: VCEL), a leading developer of patient-specific expanded cellular therapies for the treatment of severe diseases and conditions, today announced the presentation and publication of results from the company?s Phase 2b ixCELL-DCM clinical study of ixmyelocel-T in patients with advanced heart failure due to ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The data were presented today by Timothy Henry, M.D., at the Late-Breaking Clinical Trial Session and press conference at the American College of Cardiology?s (ACC) 65th Annual Scientific Session and published in The Lancet. Dr. Henry is director of cardiology at Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute, principal investigator of the study and co-author of the Lancet publication. ?The ixCELL-DCM study met its primary endpoint of demonstrating a reduction in the total number of all-cause deaths, cardiovascular hospitalizations, or unplanned outpatient and emergency department visits to treat acute decompensated heart failure during the 12 months following treatment with ixmyelocel-T compared to placebo,? said Dr. David Recker, Vericel?s chief medical officer. ?From a safety perspective, the incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events, in patients treated with ixmyelocel-T was comparable to or lower than patients in the placebo group. We are very excited about the results of this clinical trial and greatly appreciate the contributions of the patients, investigators and dedicated personnel who participated in this study.? ?We have a major unmet need in the treatment of class III and IV heart failure,? said Amit N. Patel, M.D., director of clinical regenerative medicine and associate professor of surgery at the University of Utah and the Chair of the ixCELL-DCM Steering Committee. ?Based on these positive results, we are encouraged that ixmyelocel-T has the potential, if approved, to represent an important new option for patients with class III and class IV heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy.? The ixCELL-DCM clinical trial is a multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ixmyelocel-T compared to placebo (vehicle control) when administered via transendocardial catheter-based injections to subjects with end-stage heart failure due to ischemic DCM. A total of 126 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure were randomly assigned to receive either ixmyelocel-T or placebo, and 114 patients were treated at 28 sites in the United States. All clinical events in the primary and secondary endpoints were adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an independent adjudication committee. The trial met its primary endpoint with patients in the ixmyelocel-T group having a 37 percent reduction in all-cause deaths, cardiovascular hospitalizations, or unplanned outpatient and emergency department visits to treat acute decompensated heart failure during the 12 months following treatment compared to the placebo group (p=0.0344). The primary endpoint was driven by a reduction in both all-cause deaths and cardiovascular hospitalizations. In the primary endpoint without procedure-related events, three percent of patients in the ixmyelocel-T group died and 38 percent had cardiovascular hospitalizations one or more times, compared to 14 percent and 47 percent, respectively, in the placebo group. All deaths were adjudicated to be due to cardiovascular causes. With respect to the secondary endpoints of the trial, the components of the primary endpoint were also analyzed using the Win ratio in a hierarchical manner to incorporate both the incidence and timing of the endpoint components. The Win ratio result of 1.56 showed that more often ixmyelocel-T was the ?winner? in that the time to death, left ventricular assist device placement, heart transplantation or time to cardiovascular hospitalization was shorter for placebo-treated patients, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. The time to first event was longer in the ixmyelocel-T group compared to placebo, but was not statistically significant. There were no significant structural changes in left ventricle cavity size or left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by echocardiogram in either the ixmyelocel-T or placebo groups. Both treatment groups had an improvement in the NYHA class and six minute walk test, with no statistical difference between the groups at month 12 using last observation carried forward. Overall, there were fewer adverse events and serious adverse events in the ixmyelocel-T group compared to the placebo group. Adverse events included those typically related to catheterization or injection procedures. The ixCELL-DCM trial showed a statistically significant reduction in clinical events driven by both cardiac mortality and cardiac hospitalizations at 12 months compared to placebo. These results are consistent with two previous Phase 2a studies which showed that ischemic DCM patients treated with ixmyelocel-T experienced fewer major adverse cardiovascular events during follow up compared to control patients. Vericel will host a webcast at 12:00pm ET on Tuesday, April 5, 2016 to review ixmyelocel-T and the Phase 2b ixCELL-DCM trial results. Dr. Gary L. Schaer, M.D., of Rush University Medical Center and a member of the ixCELL-DCM Steering Committee, will present an overview of the results from the ixCELL-DCM clinical trial and Dr. Ross Tubo, Vericel?s chief scientific officer, will present additional background information on ixmyelocel-T and describe the potential benefits of expanded multicellular therapy in the repair and regeneration of ischemic tissue. The live webcast and a recording will be available at the events and presentations section of the Vericel website at investors.vcel.com/events.cfm. Both the Lancet publication and the ACC Scientific Sessions presentation, as well as additional data and analysis not presented at ACC, are currently available at investors.vcel.com/events.cfm. About Dilated Cardiomyopathy Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a progressive disease of the heart, is a leading cause of heart failure and heart transplantation. DCM is characterized by weakening of the heart muscle and enlargement of the heart chambers, leading to systolic abnormalities (difficulty of the left ventricle to pump blood). Heart enlargement and poor function generally lead to progressive heart failure with further decline in the ability of the heart to pump blood efficiently throughout the body. About Ixmyelocel-T Ixmyelocel-T is a patient-specific, expanded multicellular therapy manufactured from the patient?s own bone marrow using Vericel?s proprietary, highly automated, fully closed cell-processing system. This process selectively expands the population of mesenchymal stromal cells and alternatively activated macrophages, which are responsible for production of anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic factors known to be important for repair of damaged tissue. Ixmyelocel-T has been designated as an orphan drug by the U.S Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment of DCM. About the ixCELL-DCM Clinical Trial The ixCELL-DCM clinical trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ixmyelocel-T compared to placebo (vehicle control) when administered via transendocardial catheter-based injections to subjects with end-stage heart failure due to ischemic DCM, who have no reasonable revascularization options (either surgical or percutaneous interventional) likely to provide clinical benefit. The primary endpoint of the ixCELL-DCM clinical trial study is the number of all-cause deaths, cardiovascular hospital admissions, and unplanned outpatient and emergency department visits to treat acute decompensated heart failure over the 12 months following administration of ixmyelocel-T compared to placebo. About Vericel Corporation Vericel Corporation is a leader in developing patient-specific expanded cellular therapies for use in the treatment of patients with severe diseases and conditions.

The Dengue School-Based Immunization program that commenced on Apr. 4 continues on and at the three week mark, a total of 204, 397 (73%) pupils were vaccinated out of 279,393 pupils with parents? consent. As of April 24, 2016 a total of 362 cases of Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) from the three regions where the Dengue School Based Immunization Program were received. The top five common reactions were fever, headache, dizziness, vomiting, and rash. The DOH established a strict monitoring and surveillance system for adverse events and side effects following immunization. There has been a lot of coverage on the fatality of an 11-year-old boy who was vaccinated on Mar. 31. The DOH offered the following details and explanation of the case: The patient is claimed to have been diagnosed to have congenital heart disease during his childhood. No maintenance medication was taken since his transfer to his current guardians. During immunization of dengue vaccine, the patient was screened and assessed by the RHU physician at the school. When asked the guardian (uncle) denied history of fever, illness, and maintenance medication during assessment. On April 3, 2016 patient developed diarrhea and fever, he was seen and examined the next day at the Bagac Community Medicare Hospital and was diagnosed to have amoebiasis. Patient was sent home with medications. On April 9, the patient was seen and admitted at the Isaac Catalina Medical Center after experiencing difficulty of breathing, fever, and cough. He was initially diagnosed with pneumonia, severe; congenital heart disease in Congestive Heart Failure, and electrolyte imbalance. April 10, the patient was referred and transferred to Bataan General Hospital. April 11, patient had a cardiac arrest and was eventually pronounced dead. The immediate cause of death was pulmonary edema with the following underlying causes: congenital heart disease, Acute Gastroenteritis with moderate dehydration. The case was presented to the National Adverse Event Following Immunization Committee (NAEFIC) last April 21, 2016 to assess the findings. Their conclusion is consistent with the hospital findings. The dengue vaccination is coincidental. According to NAEFIC, congenital heart disease is not an exclusion criterion for vaccination. The Philippines reported more than 200,000 dengue cases last year and nearly 600 deaths. As of April 9, 2016, a total of 33, 658 suspected dengue cases were reported nationwide. The Philippines has the highest incidence of dengue and ranks number 1 in the Western Pacific Region from 2013 to 2015. outbreaknewstoday",0

"""" Statins stimulate atherosclerosis and heart failure: pharmacological mechanisms Harumi Okuyama, Peter H Langsjoen, Tomohito Hamazaki, Yoichi Ogushi, Rokuro Hama, Tetsuyuki Kobayashi & Hajime Uchino In contrast to the current belief that cholesterol reduction with statins decreases atherosclerosis, we present a perspective that statins may be causative in coronary artery calcification and can function as mitochondrial toxins that impair muscle function in the heart and blood vessels through the depletion of coenzyme Q 10 and ? heme A ? , and thereby ATP generation. Statins inhibit the synthesis of vitamin K 2 , the cofactor for matrix Gla-protein activation, which in turn protects arteries from calcification. Statins inhibit the biosynthesis of selenium containing proteins, one of which is glutathione peroxidase serving to suppress peroxidative stress. An impairment of selenoprotein biosynthesis may be a factor in congestive heart failure, reminiscent of the dilated cardiomyopathies seen with selenium deficiency. Thus, the epidemic of heart failure and atherosclerosis that plagues the modern world may paradoxically be aggravated by the pervasive use of statin drugs.

Respiratory Disease Respiratory Disease is defined as medical conditions, affecting the breathing organ and tissues including Inflammatory lung disease, Obstructive lung diseases, Restrictive lung diseases, Respiratory tract infections, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli, the nerves and muscles breathing , etc,. Pleural disease: Pleural effusion The pleura is a thin tissue covered by a layer of cells (mesothelial cells) that surrounds the lungs and lines the inside of the chest wall. Pleural effusion is a condition of collection of fluid within the pleural cavity as a result of heart failure, bleeding (hemothorax), infections, excessive or decreased fluid volume, etc. The Complications 1. Primary Sjogren?s syndrome Sjogren?s syndrome can cause many organic changes, but is rarely accompanied by pleuritis. there is a report of a 65-year-old patient with primary Sjogren?s syndrome who developed bilateral pleuritis with moderately large effusions(35). 2. Pleurisy Pleurisy is a medical condition of an inflammation of the lining of the pleural cavity. In the study to investigate the incidence of tuberculous pleurisy among patients with adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels of 50 IU/L or less in a pleural effusion, and without a previous diagnosis of carcinomatous pleurisy or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, found that occult tuberculous pleurisy is significantly common in patients with pleural effusion ADA levels of 50 IU/L or less and who may otherwise be diagnosed with nonspecific pleurisy(36). 3. Dullness to percussion and tactile fremitus and reduced tactile vocal fremitu In the systematically review the evidence regarding the accuracy of the physical examination in assessing the probability of a pleural effusion conducted by the University of Toronto, and St Michael?s Hospital, indicated that dullness to percussion and tactile fremitus are the most useful findings for pleural effusion. Dull chest percussion makes the probability of a pleural effusion much more likely but requires a chest radiograph to confirm the diagnosis. When the pretest probability of pleural effusion is low, the absence of reduced tactile vocal fremitus makes pleural effusion less likely so that a chest radiograph might not be necessary depending on the overall clinical situation(37). 4. Tracheal deviation If the effusion is large, it may be tracheal deviation away from the effusion. According to the study by Kumomoto-chuou Hospital, there is a report of a 33-year-old male admitted to our hospital because of mediastinal bleeding by the traffic accident. He was in shock state. Chest roentgenogram showed widening of the upper mediastium, massive pleural effusion and deviation trachea to right(38). 5. Other complications In the study to independently evaluate 278 patients (196 men), aged 12 and older, admitted with respiratory symptoms.conducted at a rural hospital in India, two physicians, blinding to history and chest radiograph findings, and to each other?s results, showed that the prevalence of pleural effusion was 21% (57/278). The likelihood ratios (LRs) of positive signs ranged from 1.48 to 8.14 and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) excluded 1. Except for pleural rub, the LRs for negative signs ranged between 0.13 and 0.71. The interobserver agreement was excellent for chest expansion, vocal fremitus, percussion and breath sounds (kappa 0.84-0.89) and good for vocal resonance, crackles and auscultatory percussion (kappa 0.68-0.78). The independent predictors of pleural effusion were asymmetric chest expansion (odds ratio [OR] 5.22, 95% CI 2.06-13.23), and dull percussion note (OR 12.80, 95% CI 4.23-38.70). For the final multivariate model, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was 0.88(39). \ All Forms of Arthritis are Curable You Can Eliminate Osteoarthritis By addressing the Underlying Causes through Clinical Trials and Studies Ovarian Cysts And PCOS Elimination Holistic System In Existence That Will Show You How To Permanently Eliminate All Types of Ovarian Cysts Within 2 Months Back to General health http://kylejnorton.blogspot.ca/p/general-health.html Sources (35) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18197929 (36) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19901882 (37) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Vocal+fremitus+reduced+and+Pleural+effusion (38) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9170875 (39) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16965906",0

Yet there were also thousands of people making their living as Elvis impersonators, making a sighting very difficult to verify. But has the real Elvis been under our noses all along? Some are saying, yes, indeed so, as just this year, 2016, the ultimate Elvis sighting has taken place in the form of a groundskeeper at Graceland! Someone recorded video of the man earlier this year, and people are going wild about the possibility of a now 81-year-old Elvis, tending to his own property. 0 Yummly Make sure to Like Us on facebook to see more amazing stories like this. Here?s what the channel on YouTube, called ?The Shadow? had to say about the video that they are convinced reveals the real Elvis who is alive and well, living at Graceland: ?Pay close attention as he walks up to the camera. Look this was a fluke?I don?t think he expected us to be watching. Or maybe he just took a chance because he doesn?t usually come so close to the camera. He raises his two fingers to the top of his left head as a proof of life signal. He told us he is alive with the simple V sign. ?I?m Alive?. He is giving us a clue that he knows we are all there watching him and to his most loyal fans that he is indeed with us. Our personal view is it?s him. When you look at his walk and gait, long arms it?s him 100 per cent. As he approaches he looks at the camera. As he walks away he glances at the camera. We tried to look at his right hand to see the pinkie finger but he kept three fingers folded back as if to hide the finger. We confirmed with a few sources that used to work at Graceland that it?s him. As soon as they saw the images we sent, they wrote back and said ?yes?, IT IS him as they remember him with the exact same ponytail. One said he had gained weight. But to be fair Elvis loves food and always had a problem with gaining weight so this should not be a surprise.? Well, who knows if this is really Elvis or not, but it sure does sound convincing! Share this with all of your Elvis loving friends and family and see if they believe The King is still alive!",0

In this scenario, the emphasis of ventricular filling during late diastole increases the (A) component of the E/A ratio causing a reversal of the ratio, hence an indication of diastolic dysfunction. U0126 Left atrial volume has also been described as an excellent biomarker of the chronicity of diastolic dysfunction and of cardiovascular disease risk [11]. Parameters of diastolic function such as early diastolic velocities measured as E prime (e??), the e?? to late diastolic filling (A??) ratio (e??/A??), and the transmitral to mitral annular early diastolic velocity ratio (E/e??) [12] have all been shown to predict mortality and cardiovascular events [13, 14]. The early diastolic velocity of the mitral valve annulus (e??) reflects the rate of myocardial relaxation. When combined with measurement of the early transmitral flow velocity (E), the resultant ratio (E/e??) correlates well with mean left ventricular end-diastolic pressure [15], hence a marker for LA pressure. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is a relatively common finding seen on Doppler echocardiography; while multiple studies demonstrate abnormal diastolic function assessment to be associated with increased cardiovascular comorbidity, it can hold varying prognostic significance depending on underlying cardiac ventricular function. It has been shown that mortality is higher in hospitalized patients with depressed left ventricular ejection fractions of less than 39% [16]. Additionally, diastolic dysfunction has been recognized as a strong predictor of mortality in acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure [17?C20]. However, isolated diastolic dysfunction has significant clinical implications as well. There is much heterogeneity regarding the prognosis of patients with diastolic dysfunction, with mortality ranging from 1.3% to 17.5% [21]. Multiple studies have shown prognostic significance of Doppler indexes of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction where patterns of abnormal relaxation increase the risk of cardiovascular events [22?C25]. In one study among 3,107 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, the small subgroup (1.7%) with diastolic dysfunction, defined as those with high LV end-diastolic pressure and no systolic dysfunction, coronary heart disease or LV dilation had a high risk of future cardiac morbid events [26]. This association between echocardiographic markers of abnormal relaxation and decreased survival, even in those with no AV-951 history of CHF, suggests that echocardiography may help identify those who are predisposed to adverse outcomes [23]. Given that many lung transplant candidates are excluded with systolic depression, further evaluation of isolated diastolic dysfunction may help identify those at high risk for complications.",0

To Its Research Database. About Hypertension Drugs Hypertension, or high blood pressure (BP), develops when there is too much pressure against the inner walls of blood vessels. Depending on the pressure exerted, hypertension can be classified as: ? PAH ? Systemic hypertension (commonly referred to as hypertension) PAH, high BP in the arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs, occurs when blood vessels narrow, making blood flow difficult. This creates pressure on the heart's right ventricle, which increases in size and becomes weaker due to the excess load, leading to heart failure. The normal pulmonary arterial pressure at rest is 14 mmHg and increases from 25 mmHg to 30 mmHg. Systemic hypertension occurs when blood vessels that supply oxygenated blood to the body become narrower, creating pressure on the right side of the heart. Hypertension can lead to damaged organs and illnesses such as renal failure (kidney failure), aneurysm, heart failure, stroke, or heart attack. Hypertension is classified into two types: ? Primary or essential hypertension: It is defined as high BP with no known cause, and includes around 90%-95% of all hypertension cases ? Secondary hypertension: It is high BP with a known direct cause, including kidney disease, tumors, or birth control pills, and includes 5%-10% of all hypertension cases Technavio?s analysts forecast the global hypertension drugs market to decline at a CAGR of (0.93) % during the period 2016-2020.

The blood clot that causes the heart attack usually forms at the site of rupture of an atherosclerotic, cholesterol plaque on the inner wall of a coronary artery. Heart failure damages the heart muscle at the cellular level. It's generally thought that the heart muscle damage caused by heart failure is permanent. However, Imperial College researchers found that heart failure damage can be reversed if the heart muscle is simply allowed to rest and heal. Susceptible to coronary blockages that can cut off blood and destroy major hunks of heart muscle at one time in a heart attack, the heart can only heal itself slowly, often leaving behind thinned and baggy scar tissue devoid of healthy, beating muscle.Myocardial infarction (MI; Latin: infarctus myocardii) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood stops flowing properly to a part of the heart, and the heart muscle is injured because it is not receiving enough oxygen.",0

Of course, there will always be experts on the topic and I will hew pegs on the head for a solution that I made. I am not an expert on audio, but for me, such a solution is sufficient. Just with age no longer hear everything ... There will be some people who will not correspond to my concept and will stand by the only possible solution (of course for them), namely the removal of the radio signals, RCA (or changing the radio), and adding an amplifier. I do not fully coincide ... I do not want to interfere with radio or a system of wires and do not want to give up the display. I want to be in the middle looked like a factory ... The more that the 206-ka is not a car premium ... but actually for me, unless, however, is if someone does not fit yet can not do this or delegate the task to those skilled in CA, but it usually involves the release of a thick money, or do it your way. Of course, getting the original is possible, but easy is not ... extra price for a set of prohibitive ... I started to gain diagrams audio system with JBL and their little analysis. I needed were the ""guts"" ... I bought it on a well-known site. I needed were: - amp ... eg. A: - subwoofer: - other speakers audio system: Found I have all the parts ... amplifier can be purchased for approx. 30-120z? (although there are even 200 PLN !!), the subwoofer was expensive ... approx. 160 PLN. Subwoofer was so I actually needed for the speaker ... but write about it at a later stage. After the observation, namy?leniach, thoughts and zastanawianiach, bought speakers called. MIDBASS - HERTZ EV-165.5 kit ESK-165 http://www.hertzaudiovideo.com/wp-co...165.5_tech.pdf I bought them together with spacers dedicated to the Peugeot 206 at the price of 250 PLN. Tweeters Harman-Kardon with a set of factory Peugeot acquired with triangles mirrors for 30 PLN / pcs. For those who do not have anything, they can buy a whole set of ECC-165 (approx. 450 PLN with spacers MDF). If someone wants to, it can acquire other speakers, according to the abundance pocket ... it's not quide elections speakers Anyway about speakers can write and write ... and always will be an opportunity to do something better. There had to be a better sound for relatively little money. Experts CA will be upset that I installed speakers in the rear doors because ""scene breaks"" ... perhaps they are right, but this is the car a family and travel together, so if sitting in the back wanted to listen to music I would have to increase the volume and this would lead me crazy . Another purchase was soundproofing mats on the door. The choice fell on the mat soundproofing tanks (alubutyl) STP SILVER and foam rubber damping 6mm (K6s). This is only the first, the inside of soundproofing with the remnants of a glue after the original film. Here paste the image of the front door already taken ... I forgot to take pictures during their wrapping and now I have to remove the bacon ... Without soundproofing doors do not expect effects ... soundproofing is essential !! For now, I have done only the front, but I look forward to some free time, money, and I'll back plus luggage ... who knows if not yet tempted to center? A cursory analysis of patterns found that they are all based on the same standard. Speaker outputs of the radio (it does not matter from what ... if the RB3, RD3, RT3 or RD4) are connected directly to the amplifier JBL. On the other hand, ""we work out"" the sounds of the individual channels and sends them to the speakers already. As you can see, it can specify blocks that are interested us: - Radio - Amplifier LP - Speaker front left LP hf - Speaker front left tweeter LT - speaker rear left LT and PT sub - subwoofer left and right channels in one housing PT - speaker right behind the PP hf - speaker front right tweeter PP - right speaker front electrical connections radio RB / D3 and the amplifier and speaker connections: installation speaker must perform in accordance with the schedule. As the radio usually () has the power, you have to focus on the power amplifier. It is provided on pin 1 black plug while the weight on the pin 8 of that plug. Fuse protection should be the value of 30A. I did it as much as I have done installation BM34, supply shutting windows - separate fuse -> Please see a description here: http://www.206club.net/showthread.ph...38#post1600338 should still be interested in pin 7 of the black plug. It is connected to the radio, to pin corresponding to a ""permit"" to run the amplifier, something a la ""standby"" ... or ""Remote"" .... Otherwise, writing: turn on the radio -> turn on the amplifier, turn the radio -> turn off the amplifier. We need to connect the 7 pin plug amplifier with pin 5 Section A radio plug (figure below). Schematic pin plug for RB / D3: When buying an amplifier ""got"" to set the plug into it. What greatly helped me alteration. Talking with a friend from Krakow (cheers Robert) hinted at matching connectors from something else ... but the 206-ki ... as someone wants I can call him and add it here ... Now the question of assembly ... I thought a long time to solve the problems associated with placement of everything in the car. And after a long deliberation I decided to mount the amplifier in the glove box. I checked that it can not be damaged legs and hence the decision. In addition, I was in this location close to the plug-in radio ... leaves the assembly and pulling wires. This contributed to the lowest possible interference in the wiring. The need to perform a beam combining: ? speaker output on the radio -> input of the amplifier; ? amplifier output -> plug into speakers. By doing it, we can come back in a minute earlier calls (without repeater). Soon there will be some who find that the original wiring is to ""D ..."". Sure they are partially right. But if the factory radio has an output power of approx. 15-18W RMS, and this amp has 25W RMS so I see no need to change cables (tedious and time-consuming). How do I know that the amplifier is 25W? Because (like a real man) I got under it, and read the scalaczk?w their name - TDA8563Q - Class B amplifier, working in the bridge. In the notes directory, you can read his power to be 25W / 4? THD = 10%, and 14.4V power. This power is ""available"" for each channel. I will not elaborate on the power amplifier ... I refer, eg. Here: www.alldatasheet.pl/datasheet-pdf/pdf/19514/PHILIPS/TDA8563Q.html The amplifier has 4 systems TDA8563Q. So we get: 1. SCALAK - front L and P woofers 2. SCALAK - front L and P tweeters 3. SCALAK - back L and P broadband 4. SCALAK - back 1st and 2nd subwoofer amplifier JBL is not such a amplifier, I have, in addition to the power amplifiers, filters separating the frequency band of the specific type of speaker. Separated only the front and subwoofer. Pay attention to the output of the amplifier subwoofer. It feeds the subwoofer speaker, consisting of two coils in one case speaker (speaker double solenoid). By the way, I wonder if it would be proven design with two separate speakers in one enclosure? With the structure and patterns that can not be like that, connect the speakers as you want. You need to connect them exactly as predicted manufacturer, you would not get the effect you expect, or even uszkodzimy amplifier / speaker. And yes, the pins 7 and 15 and 8 and 16 are intended only for the subwoofer output !! A pins 1 and 2 and 9 and 10 are used only for output front tweeters !! There is no need to use crossover filter frequency division for specific speakers because they have done so already integrated in the amplifier. The rear speakers are tweeters (they must) be equipped with capacitor odseparowuj?cy the bass (usually do). Somewhere in the depths of the internet, I found the characteristics of the amplifier JBL ... As you can see the producers already took care of the distribution of frequency and damping. Unfortunately, in my SW missing pillar, no place in the plug (due to the established folding mirrors). So I had to tighten the tweeter additional cables using the Upgrade connector one-steam purchased from your local electronics store for 2,5z? / pcs. Those who do not have the option full electrics mirrors will not need it, because they will have more space in the plug. With the whole ""fuss"" with speaker cables is only tightening the wires to the subwoofer and whistles front. Subwoofer - The number of wires - 4 (two pairs). I chose to wires ? 5mm2. Mounting leave already own creativity interested because of the banality of execution. This connection is done by laying the cables in the original factory mounts along the threshold of the car (under the carpeted floor). Trivial solution and the easiest. Dismantle need only the lower part of the door seals and plastic in the middle column (fastening of seat belts). Until the end of yet switched on the radio options, output settings from the ""speaker"" to ""amp"" ... (the program PP2000). But here it is the ""pogadania."" I do not know what a miracle, but I have two radio RD3-01 Clarion, which behave differently! Ie. one set to have a ""speaker"" and the second the ""enhancer"" and then play both good. But the change in their value on the contrary is both play quietly! I do not know why I like it the same receivers. I do not know whether zatrybicie to this translation ... Of course I will not elaborate on the correct installation and caution and accuracy, as well as for checking all across the stage adaptive audio system, because I think the case is clear in this regard. Now matter subwoofer ... I made a chest size under the trunk so that it nicely komponowa?o a whole. I measured the capacity of the factory for the subwoofer speaker and it came to me, that is 8 liters. I made your subwoofer design matched to the SW and my thanks to the 25mm MDF board got a similar result ... well, maybe a little bit bigger. Well, that little boy still learning it helped me to calculate because ""thanks"" slants and tilts the side wall and the front, it was not as easy as an ordinary simple case ... And I wanted to know exactly how much a liter this project. The hardest part was I cut the wall plate with slants ... Square meter board costs in Koszalin approx. PLN 50 ... enough was enough in my project, and still is. The entire casing is made of a closed own so mad ni ma ... Design chest leaned on several filmikach, which are available on YouTube. The cut actually milled grooves serve to mask the connections of material ... such a solution also found the net ... somehow it was called, but I do not remember how. Why housing closed? Because she can / forgives many mistakes. All the walls are glued and screwed. Screws chose flat-head because after drilling plates larger drill, nicely hide and you can not feel the material. Inside and outside whole lakierowa?em clear acrylic lacquer. Additionally, the connection between the walls sealed with clear silicone. Veneer material (blanket) glued glue upholstery ... as you can see I was able to choose even the color Now a question of mounting the subwoofer ... As you can see in the pictures below, I chose to mount towards the left ... I do not remember why, but I had to be a reason. Fixing the subwoofer is a little strange, but, unfortunately, to date I have not found another important ... it works. Well, to secure the speaker to be removed! And what's next? Well ... you need to remove one of the mounting studs bacon and through this opening to postpone the screw that has to go through accordingly to the drilled hole in the rear of the subwoofer. After twisting the whole body is not going to fly the trunk. Of course, the hole in the wall secured silicone. Then mount the speaker and grille. What got? Actually ... that's probably not envy the wife of the original JBL'a Anyway, stated that the SW game somehow better ... The effect is probably worse than the CA for 2000z?, but as I said, with age but the hearing is deteriorating ... P.S. Such were the stages of the construction of the box ... I guess so ...",0

I think I was dreading this birthday partly because my mother died at 74. ( Her birth day was Feb. 3, 1911, mine is Feb. 4,1941.) My mother died of congestive heart failure and actually outlived her doctors? predictions by about a year. So I drank my morning coffee and tried to sort out the jumble of thoughts and emotions. This 75th birthday, so close to the beginning of a new year, was definitely for me a liminal experience, as daughter Eleni would call it. (?Limen? means threshold in Latin.) Eleni studied anthropology in college and in her blog ?The Liminal Stage?. she explains: ?Liminal stages are psychological thresholds, times of transition when we stand ?betwixt and between? one state and another. The biggies are birth, marriage, death---cultures develop splashy rituals around these transitions to ease the anxiety they provoke.? You can guess which liminal stage I was contemplating. In fact, I?ve been talking so much about death in recent months that my kids and husband keep razzing me about it. I?ve sent them memos about what I want and don?t want at my funeral. (No open coffin, in fact no body or casket. Funeral service for immediate family only. Some time later a party/open house/memorial service with no eulogies, only extemporaneous anecdotes with lots of food, wine and music. I?ve already worked out the entire mix of songs I want -?heavy on Led Zeppelin and Queen.) Before her death, my mother, the world?s most organized person, had written down the hymns and scripture readings for her funeral, specified cremation, and purchased the mausoleum niche where her ashes, and my father?s, would be stowed in brass boxes that resemble books. She chose a niche which had a view of the swans on the cemetery?s pond. She had all their financial affairs in order, filed neatly in her desk when she died. My father, on the other hand, had dementia as well as Parkinson?s disease until he died at 80, so he didn?t even known when my mother died. His dementia first became evident at our parents? fiftieth wedding anniversary in 1982, when he was about 76. Needless to say, I?ve been watching myself for signs of Alzheimer?s, and avidly doing Lumosity ?brain games? every day. (Daughter Marina kindly signed me up, knowing my worry about memory loss.) I realize, as recent articles have pointed out, that Lumosity doesn?t really help you stave off dementia. It just measures how you become better at the games with practice. But nevertheless, it gave me comfort that yesterday?s workout results put me at 91.3% LPI --whatever that is-- as compared with my age group, and 97.3 % for ?problem solving? (but only 81.9 % for memory.) I was happy that my numbers had gone up, but then I realized that, overnight, the age group I was being compared to had changed from ?age 70 to 74? to ?over 75.? Less competition! For the past fifty years or so I?ve been making pretty much the same New Year?s resolutions as everyone else: Lose ten pounds, go to the gym (or Pilates) twice a week, publish a book with my own name on it, learn Spanish (so I can communicate better with my bilingual grandchildren.) This year my New Year?s resolutions changed. I?m no longer interested in improving my weight, career, or possessions (but still want to learn Spanish). All my resolutions can be collected under the theme: GET RID OF STUFF. I am a hoarder, as my family will attest. I even bought the best seller ?The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up"" by Marie Kondo, but after reading several chapters I had to stop, because it was making me feel so guilty. Now I?m going to target certain areas?my studio, my computer desk, my make-up area, the library and especially my closets?one at a time. Tons of papers have to go. All those books I?ll never read again will be donated to the Grafton library for sale. All my office-appropriate clothes will go to ?Dress for Success? so that other, younger women can find jobs. I?ve told the kids, whatever they want, take it now, (in hopes of avoiding, as among my mother?s nine siblings, bitter schisms between two children who want the same antique bureau.) As the day of my 75th birthday moved from morose reflections over coffee to astonishment at the sight of over 200 birthday wishes on the internet, I alternated between tears (over the card my husband gave me) and laughter (for instance when daughter Eleni posted on Facebook: ?Did you know that on her 60th birthday I witnessed this woman sip from a hash milkshake in Amsterdam? Trust me, she was in it for the milkshake. Happy Birthday, Party Girl!) I was delighted to receive calls and gifts from son Chris and daughter Marina, both on the opposite side of the country, and chuckled at the books Marina sent: ?The Alzheimer?s Prevention Program?, ?Keep Your Brain Alive? and ?41 Uses For a Grandma? among them. At the end of the day, at dinner in the romantic restaurant Casa Tua in South Beach, FL, Nick and I told each other how lucky we are that we?ve made it through 45 years of marriage, that we have three great kids and two extraordinary grandchildren, and that when we get up in the morning, no parts of our bodies hurt. That?s a rare blessing when your age group is ?over 75.? So by the time the waiter brought a birthday cr?me brul?e with a candle in it, (as well as a ?chocolate meltdown??both surprises ordered by daughter Eleni)-- I felt ready to cross the threshold into the next liminal stage, whatever it brings.",0

A person has never reached true success if he has never felt real happiness. As a matter of fact the declaration of independence states, that happiness and the pursuit there off is man?s in alienable right. Meaning it is a god given right. Why Do We Have to Be Happy? People say that life is complicated enough without having to be moody or sad every single day of your life. According to science elation triggers hormones that are essential for proper metabolic function and well being. The happy feeling also brings about the positive side of a person. Which ever premise you choose, it is absolutely important for a person to feel happiness in his lifetime. Reality Check In reality however, poverty, stress, violence, competition, and oppression is all around us. In Africa and other third world countries we see people dying of hunger, we see those in power abuse and beat down people to gain a foot ahead of their own country men. We see everything around us, but we fail to look within ourselves. Chances are your one of the thousands if not millions of people taking antidepressants. Actually statistics say that 20% of Americans take antidepressant, and overdose of MAOI?s are not uncommon. The American Psychological Association asserts that children 14 and above will start having depressive episodes at least ones a year until the age of 30. Sadness leaves a profound effect on the human body and spirit. Humans tend to lean towards negativity because it tends to carry more weight that happiness. The unfortunate thing is that scientifically deep rooted sadness is the underlying cause for diseases such as, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular accidents, apnea, and migraine. Coaching vs. Therapy It is important to prevent rather than cure. That is why when the first signs of restlessness ensue it is betting to bring in a life coaching expert. Therapists focus on past events, to analyze the present emotional, and mental condition of the people. They dig deep into the darkest corners of a person?s mind to find the root of unhappiness. Life coaches however focus on the present. Usually when a person feels the first nagging doubt of sadness the cause is immediately within reaching distance. Mind Power Life coaching uses the power of the mind to promote a positive effect on a person?s life. The mind is a powerful thing. It knows, it feels and it aggravates a person into action. Pursuing happiness is a mental effort. Actualization is achieved thru realization. A person is better able to see the road when he knows where he is going. It is not easy, although nothing ever is but with the aid of a life coach and the program a person is better able to focus because there is guidance and mentoring. As much as a life coach wants to help you achieve your full potential and are happy there are limitations as to the scope of duties a life coach can perform. A life coach is not psychologically educated. Therefore they are not equipped with the expertise to treat a mentally and emotionally distraught person who is on the verge of utter hopelessness. If this is the case then it is better to seek medical help. Find More Betting Articles",0

Psych patients have medical issues and if you start a psych med that interacts with something they take for a medical condition or exacerbates that condition then 1) that's your own malpractice, and 2) you're hurting the people you're supposed to help. For instance, I had a transgender patient who was on ""an androgen blocker,"" but couldn't remember the name. They also had frequent nightmares. My preceptor started them on prazosin, which treats nightmares but is also a blood pressure medication. The patient started fainting. Turns out they were on spironolactone, which is an androgen blocker and a blood pressure med. The patient wasn't harmed, but could have been. My experience in med-surg has helped me avoid drug interactions or exacerbating someone's heart failure or diabetes more times than I can count. You could also work in psych as an RN and that would be beneficial. It will allow you to observe psych symptoms and recovery, drug dosages, side effects, etc. I worked inpatient psych while I was in grad school specifically for that reason and it helped a lot. Now when I have a patient decompensating I can ask myself if they present like the patients I saw admitted to my inpatient unit and decide if I need to send them to the ER or if I can safely treat them outpatient.",0

Respiratory Disease Respiratory Disease is defined as medical conditions, affecting the breathing organ and tissues including Inflammatory lung disease, Obstructive lung diseases, Restrictive lung diseases, Respiratory tract infections, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli, the nerves and muscles breathing, etc,. Pulmonary vascular disease: Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease Pulmonary vascular disease is defined as a condition of blood flow to the lung?s artery is blocked suddenly due to a blood clot somewhere in the body, including pulmonary embolism, chronic thromboembolic disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, pulmonary edema, etc. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is an extremely rare form of pulmonary hypertension, affecting mostly in children and young adults as a result of a progressive obstruction of small pulmonary veins that leads to elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular failure. The Diagnosis Patients in the early stage with early pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) may experience no symptoms at all, but the progression of diseasse may attributable to pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure supervene(32). B.1. Noninvasive diagnosis to detect PVOD(33) A noninvasive diagnostic approach may include 1. Chest high-resolution computed tomographymay be helpful for clinical differential diagnosis of PVOD and PCH In the study to examine chest HRCT images for four patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), three patients with PVOD and three patients with PCH, and to evaluate pulmonary vascular casts of lung tissues obtained from those patients at lung transplantation or autopsy, found that Measurement of the sizes of centrilobular GGOs in HRCT is a simple and useful method for clinical differential diagnosis of PVOD and PCH(34). 2. Arterial blood gas analysis(ABG) The aim of the blood withdrawn from an artery, involving puncturing an artery with a thin needle and syringe is to determine the pH of the blood, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and oxygen, the bicarbonate level and gas exchange which reflect gas exchange across the alveolar-capillary membrane(35). 3. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) It is a complete evaluation of the respiratory system including patient history, physical examinations, chest x-ray examinations, arterial blood gas analysis, and tests of pulmonary function(36). 4. Bronchoalveolar lavage Bronchoalveolar lavage has a well established role in the diagnosis of pulmonary infections, particularly those due to opportunistic organisms in an immunocompromised host with an aim to assess a number of pulmonary components of whchi may be useful in this regard, particularly if combined with new methods for examining inflammatory responses, such as those utilising the polymerase chain reaction to assess cellular expression for inflammatory cytokines and growth factors.(37). 5. Transthoracic Echocardiography Transthoracic echocardiography is an important initial non-invasive diagnostic tool with aim to evaluate patients in whom pulmonary hypertension is suspected, according to the ACCF/AHA 2009 Expert Consensus Document on Pulmonary Hypertension(38). 6. Flow cytometry Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) both display occlusive remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature responsible for increased pulmonary vascular resistances. Cytotoxic T (CTL), natural killer (NK), and natural killer T (NKT) cells play a critical role in vascular remodeling in different physiological and pathological conditions. According to study, a decrease in GNLY demethylation in the gDNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and explanted lungs was found specifically in PVOD but not in PAH. This was associated with a decrease in populations and subpopulations of CTL and NKT and an increase of NK populations. Despite the reduced granulysin-containing cells in patients with PVOD, GNLY serum levels were higher, suggesting these cells were wasting their content. Furthermore, the increase of GNLY concentration in the serum of PVOD was significantly higher than in patients with PAH(39). B.2. Surgical biopsy Since surgical biopsy represents a high-risk procedure in these patients, it is contraindicated. lung biopsy or pathologic examination of pulmonary explants or postmortem lung samples. However, lung biopsy is hazardous in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension, and there is a need for noninvasive diagnostic tools in this patient population. Patients with PVOD may be refractory to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-specific therapy and may even deteriorate with it. It is important to identify such patients as soon as possible, because they should be treated cautiously and considered for lung transplantation if eligible(39).

I have to not only take a water pill every day, but two other pills because I know have congestive heart failure.

I know it's hard to cut down salt, because these lyme buggers make us crave it. Every once in a while I break and plow through a bag of potato chips. I never used to really like chips!

Despite the decline in deaths over time, heart disease is still the leading cause of death in the U.S., killing more than 600,000 people per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ?The consistent progression southward over the past few decades suggests that the pattern is not random ? and could be attributed to geographic differences in prevention and treatment opportunities,? said lead author Michele Casper of the CDC?s Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. ?Identifying those counties and regions with the greatest burden of mortality is a necessary first step to target appropriate resources that will ultimately reduce death rates,? Casper told Reuters Health by email. The researchers used data on heart disease deaths among people age 35 and over in the U.S. collected in two year intervals, between 1973 and 2010, from more than 3,000 counties of the 48 contiguous states. Every county saw a decline in heart disease deaths. The average decline across the U.S. was 61 percent, but some counties only saw a decline of 9 percent while others cut heart disease deaths by 83 percent. At the beginning of the study, heart disease deaths were most common in the Northeast through Appalachia and into the Midwest. Coastal North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia also had high rates. Most counties with the lowest death rates were located in the West, with some low-rate counties also scattered in Alabama, Florida and Mississippi. By 2010, most high-rate counties were still in the eastern half of the country, but in the South, rather than in the North, with some parts of New England becoming pockets with lower death rates. Declines were slowest in counties in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and parts of Texas, the authors reported in a paper scheduled for publication in Circulation. Since the 1970s, national attention on the dangers of cigarette smoking and uncontrolled high blood pressure has led to a significant decline in deaths from coronary heart disease and heart attack, but ?heart disease? includes other conditions which have not decreased as much, said Dr. Donald A. Barr of Stanford University School of Medicine in California, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study. Comparable data for heart failure, which is a different process not due to clogging of blood vessels but due to the heart wearing out as a result of diabetes, obesity and underlying high blood pressure, has not been coming down as fast, Barr told Reuters Health by phone. ?(Heart failure) is projected to increase over the next couple of decades, while coronary heart disease is expected to decline,? he said. Heart failure disproportionately affects low-income Americans and African Americans, he said. ?These at-risk populations are found in a somewhat higher proportion in those southeastern states.? ?Combining heart failure and coronary heart disease under the global term ?heart disease? combines good news with not so good news,? Barr said. There were still meaningful declines in heart disease deaths in the South, Casper noted. ?Heart disease-related deaths are largely preventable, and with targeted public health efforts, it?s possible to alleviate much of the heavy burden of this disease and close the geographic gap in declining heart disease death rates,? Casper said. ?With collaboration, government agencies, medical care organizations, community groups, businesses and other organizations can provide more local opportunities for physical activity, as well as access to smoke-free spaces, affordable healthy foods, quality healthcare and social and economic well-being.?

GEORGIOS KEFALAS AP i Order Reprint of this Story Novartis said its first-quarter earnings fell 12 percent as profits from Fort Worth-based Alcon declined and the company?s best-selling cancer medicine Gleevec faced generic competition in the U.S. Profit declined to $1.17 a share, excluding some items, the Basel, Switzerland-based company said in a statement. Revenue fell 3 percent to $11.6 billion, compared with analysts? average projection of $11.8 billion. Sales of Gleevec dropped 22 percent after the drug lost patent protection in the U.S. in February, opening the door to generic versions of the $4.7 billion-a-year product. The Alcon eye-care division continued to struggle as the company implements a plan to put the unit?s growth back on track. Alcon revenue dropped 7 percent to $1.4 billion and profit plunged 36 percent to $243 million in the first quarter. To offset the sales declines, Novartis has been trying to boost revenue from new medicines like Entresto for heart failure and the Cosentyx skin treatment. Analysts have cut their sales estimates for Entresto by 35 percent in the last three months amid weak demand for the drug, which generated $17 million in the quarter. Analysts had estimated $20.2 million in sales. Novartis forecast about $200 million in Entresto sales for this year. Cosentyx, which faces competition soon from a new psoriasis medicine sold by Eli Lilly, had sales of $176 million, beating analyst estimates of $137.1 million. The drugmaker is sticking to its forecast that 2016 sales and core operating income will be largely unchanged from last year on a constant exchange rate basis. Related content",0

Who is affected by hyponatremia? Food & Nutrition. Page 14. Hyponatremia is a life threatening condition that occurs when blood sodium levels drop below 135 mmol/L. Excessive amounts of sodium are lost through urination, perspiration, vomiting or diarrhea, resulting in hyponatremia. Overhydration, medications or certain health conditions, such as congestive heart failure, kidney disease, and syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone can also cause dilutional hyponatremia. Athletes, specifically female athletes who participate in long-duration sports most often experience hyponatremia. Certain medications such as diuretics may deplete the body of electrolytes and therefore sodium, leading to low levels in the blood. Children and the elderly who receive intravenous administration of hypotonic fluids in excessive quantities or speeds can cause dilutional hyponatremia. It?s also important to closely monitor patients who receive parental nutrition in effort to maintain proper fluid and electrolyte balance. -AC",0

The study results show that low vitamin D levels have been linked with a higher risk of having a heart attack, stroke or heart failure, among other health issues. The results come from an innovative study conducted by the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute of Salt Lake City. The study findings were presented at the American College of Cardiology Scientific Sessions in Chicago. Avoid low vitamin D levels: This is a powerful way to protect your heart Higher risk of stroke, heart issues and cardiac events seem to correlate with low levels of a specific vitamin D component as well as deficient overall levels. The researchers found that those with low vitamin D levels in both bioavailable and total amounts had more cardiovascular health challenges. (Bioavailable vitamin D refers to vitamin D in the bloodstream but not attached to proteins) For the study, lead researcher cardiovascular epidemiologist Dr. Heidi May and her colleagues studied vitamin D levels in 4,200 older adults. Around 70 percent of the participants showed coronary artery disease and a quarter had diabetes. The research team looked at levels of vitamin D elements produced during metabolism to find connections to future cardiac issues. Studying the unbound bioavailable vitamin D was key, as only 10 to 15 percent of vitamin D can act during metabolism. However, both total vitamin D levels and bioavailable amounts were accurate in predicting the risk of heart issues down the road. Vitamin D is crucial to many areas of your health profile The study ultimately concluded that people with higher vitamin D levels had the lowest risk of heart attack, heart failure, stroke and death. The study underscores the importance of vitamin D to overall health throughout our lifetime. Other research has shown how important vitamin D is to memory, cognitive health and avoiding Alzheimer?s in older age as well. Persons already experiencing coronary health issues should consider having their vitamin D levels checked and take action if a lack of vitamin D is detected. Doing so could be crucial to cardiovascular and overall health. Sunshine, diet and supplements can all provide vitamin D While vitamin D can be prescribed or taken in supplement form, one of the best ways to receive it is from the sun. It should be noted that people of different races tend to process vitamin D at different levels; those with darker skin may require more supplementation regardless of sun exposure. Foods that are rich in vitamin D include fatty fish like salmon, sardines and herring. Raw milk and some breakfast cereals contain vitamin D ? but, one must be careful about food allergies. (if they exist) In addition, whole eggs, mushrooms and ricotta cheese offer vitamin D. But, again, how the food was produced plus dietary sensitivities must be considered before choosing a way of eating. Bottom line: Get your vitamin D level tested (don?t guess) and make the necessary changes to ensure optimal health.

I find it hard to believe that tomorrow is August 1st. I have to admit that I won't be sorry to see the hot and humid weather of this summer, leave us for some autumn weather. I haven't been able to be outside very much during the month of July. June wasn't too bad, but July was terrible. Because of my Chronic Congestive Heart Failure and other heart issues, when I'm out during humid weather, my chest feels like there's a ton of bricks pressing down on it and I can't breathe. So, consequently, I remain indoors on most summer days. I'm not complaining though, I'm so thankful that I'm still living. If that means staying inside during the summer, then so be it. What's been happening in your life? I hope only good things, but I know that usually isn't the case. We really have to accept the troubling times, as well as, the good things. Those bad things help us to appreciate it when things go our way. I try very hard to take one day at a time, accepting whatever happens to me each day. I know that God has a plan for each of us, but it will only be revealed in His time, not ours. Most things happen for a reason, although we don't know what that reason is at that time. God does work in mysterious ways. I grew up hearing the quote: """"When one door closes, another one opens for us."""" I believe this with all my heart and soul. The problem arises when we think we know what should be behind that new door. It's not up to us! It's up to God! This world needs to put their trust in God, not in worldly things. I detest all the hatred and killings that are taking place in this world we all live in today. What we need to do is pray, love one another and stop blaming everyone else for our bad choices. I truly believe that a lot of this behavior falls on the shoulders of the parents. Too many parents today are afraid to discipline their children the way they need to do. I understand that parents are instructed by counselors to try to reason with their children when they back talk them, shout and scream at their parents, when they do whatever they want regardless what the parent says. What is happening in this world today. I see nothing wrong with strong discipline for children starting when they are toddlers. That's the way I raised my three daughters and they're strong, wonderful Moms. They raised their sons the same way and I pray that my Grandsons will raise their children just the same. Too many children are rude and disrespectful to their parents and to everyone. I'm sorry but that's just wrong. I can remember, since I was a young child, being taught that you always respect your elders. That starts with your parents and grandparents and carries on from there. What is the answer to our problems? I truly don't know, but I'm thankful that I'm not raising young children today. I truly fear for this world in the future generations. We all need to pray for each other, it's the best thing we can do for one another. I hope you have a good Monday, tomorrow. Be safe and may God bless you and your families. Susan",1

""He said I have bad news your heart is done and you're now on the heart transplant list,"" Beals said. Andrea says can no longer work as a home health care provider because of her condition. She cannot afford her rent and recently moved in with her father in Macomb to be closer to Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. That's where the procedure would take place - doctors will remove a bad heart - made heavier from a break-in.

It comes with no warning. Well, at least that is what you believe. Heart attacks have several common symptoms, but most sufferer are not aware of these. Not until it is too late.how-to-recognize-a-heart-attack-one-month-before-it-happens What is even worse, there are patients who notice that something is wrong, but they tend to overlook the problem and leave it without any proper treatment. Being aware and not doing anything is like a suicide. Here is a brief list of the most common signs and symptoms of heart attacks and heart disease. In this way you will be able to recognize any strange symptoms and treat them properly. Hopefully, these will help you save your life in time. 1. Dizziness and shortness of breath If you are not asthmatic or if you are not dealing with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, your inability to catch breath may indicate only a few things, and heart attack is one of them. Dizziness is also a common symptom of heart attack and cardiovascular ailments, especially when it is accompanied with shortness of breath. 2. Being constantly sick Heart attack if usually announced through vomiting, stomach ache, indigestion or a general feeling of sickness. 3. Chest pain Chest pain is also a common symptom, and luckily most people are aware of its meaning. It may be triggered by various factors, including muscle cramping, lack of vitamins and minerals, pulmonary diseases and other the like. Medical experts explain that the pain that leads to a heart attack is usually located right under the breast bone, or slightly in the left side of the center. 4. Unusual ache (i.e. neck pain) Similar to other medical conditions, an upcoming heart attack triggers pain in unrelated part in the body. It may start off at the very center of the chest, and then spread upwards the neck or the jaw. Some patients deal with severe and unbearable neck pain, and ache in the jaw. 5. Anxiety Believe it or not, anxiety can indicate a heart disease. If your anxiety is accompanied with light-headedness and even dizziness, take special precautions because you might be dealing with a heart disease. 6. Sick-like appearance Blood pressure drops significantly prior a heart attack, which is why most sufferers look pale and like they are about to faint. 7. Palpitation Irregular and fast heart rate followed by shortness of breath, weakness, and dizziness may be a sign of a sudden heart attack. Sometimes this symptom is associated with arrhythmia and heart failure. Consider treating this condition, because when left untreated it may result in devastating healt problem. 8. Tiredness / Weakness Also a common symptom of an upcoming heart attack. Experts from the British Heart Foundation explain that women are more likely to experience tiredness or weakness, or both, prior a heart attack. 9. Sweating Patients who have survived a heart attack remember being flooded in cold sweat before the attack had happened.",0

Abstract Background . The efficacy of colonoscopy in detecting abnormalities within the colon is highly dependent on the adequacy of the bowel preparation. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of PEG lavage and split-dose PEG lavage with specific emphasis on the cleanliness of the right colon. Methods . The study was a prospective, randomized, two-arm, controlled trial of 237 patients. Patients between the age of 50 and 75 years were referred to an outpatient university screening clinic for colonoscopy. Patients were allocated to receive either a single 4?L PEG lavage or a split-dose PEG lavage. Results . Overall, the bowel preparation was superior in the split-dose group compared with the single-dose group (mean Ottawa score 3.50 ? 2.89 versus 5.96 ? 3.53; ) and resulted in less overall fluid in the colon. This effect was observed across all segments of the colon assessed. Conclusions . The current study supports use of a split-dose PEG lavage over a single large volume lavage for superior bowel cleanliness, which may improve polyp detection. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01610856 . 1. Introduction The efficacy of colonoscopy in detecting abnormalities within the colon is highly dependent on the adequacy of the bowel preparation. Despite advances in bowel preparation, the process remains difficult for patients to tolerate and complete and ultimately, if inadequate, can result in missed lesions [ 1 ]. With published literature on missed polyps and carcinomas at colonoscopy [ 2 ? 4 ], optimal visualization of the colonic mucosa becomes critically important. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that colonoscopy may not be protective against right-sided colonic lesions [ 5 , 6 ]. Subtle flat lesions with a predilection for the proximal colon, particularly those with serrated histology, are becoming increasingly significant as potential factors for the lack of protection of colonoscopy proximally and stress the importance of adequate preparations [ 7 ? 10 ]. Background. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a balanced electrolyte lavage rather than an osmotic agent; therefore its use as a bowel-cleansing preparation is typically associated with fewer fluid shifts and electrolyte abnormalities compared with low volume osmotic agents [ 11 ]. It has been widely used for colonoscopy preparation on its own [ 12 ? 16 ] or in conjunction with other agents [ 17 ? 20 ]. One disadvantage of the traditional 4?L PEG bowel preparation is a reduction in the quality of cleanliness with afternoon procedures [ 21 ], which has driven further research into timing and dosing of PEG depending on timing of the procedure [ 22 ? 26 ]. In our previous study, the 4?L PEG preparation was somewhat inferior to sodium phosphate preparations (now removed from the market) because it left a large amount of residual fluid in the colon [ 27 ]. However, the use of a split dose of PEG (2?L the day before the procedure and 2?L the morning of the procedure) may alleviate some of the shortcomings of a single 4?L preparation, particularly for afternoon procedures [ 28 ]. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of single- and split-dose PEG lavage, with specific emphasis on the cleanliness of the right colon and the influence of endoscopy time. 2. Materials and Methods All patients between the age of 50 and 75 years referred to the Forzani & MacPhail Colon Cancer Screening Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, for colonoscopy in 2010 were considered for inclusion. During preassessments at the clinic, patients were asked to participate in the study by a nurse clinician. Those not interested in participating simply received the Centre?s standard bowel preparation protocol. Patients with acute coronary syndrome, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, known or suspected renal failure, ascites, megacolon, known or suspected bowel obstruction, or other comorbidities that may prevent colonoscopy were excluded. Patients were also excluded if they previously had a partial or subtotal colectomy or if the colonoscopy was warranted for the evaluation of diarrhea. Enrollment of participants was performed by a study coordinator. A computer was used to generate a randomizations table with blocks of 8. Allocation concealment was maintained through the use of consecutively numbered sealed envelopes. The allocation ratio was 1?:?1. Colonoscopists and investigators were blinded to the allocation groups. Patients were allocated to one of two groups: (1) 4?L PEG the day before the procedure (starting at noon for AM procedures and 6:00 PM for PM procedures) or (2) 4?L of PEG in a split dose (procedure before 10 AM: 2?L at 12 noon and 2?L at 8 PM the day before the procedure; procedure after 10 AM: 2?L of PEG at 8 PM the day before the procedure, and 2?L of PEG 5 hours before the scheduled procedure time on the day of the procedure). A study assistant assigned patients to their group and instructed them on the proper use of their assigned bowel preparation method. Patients were instructed to start a low residue diet 4 days prior to the colonoscopy. A table of acceptable foods (white bread, white pasta, dairy, eggs, chicken, beef, pork, fish, cooked or steamed vegetables, and canned fruits) and foods to avoid (whole grain, brown or wild rice, oatmeal, raw fruits and berries, any food containing nuts, seeds, and popcorn) was included in the patient handout. Patients were instructed to take a light breakfast on the morning before the procedure, followed by clear fluids thereafter. Patients were given a tolerability questionnaire that was modified from a previously reported questionnaire [ 27 ], to be completed once their bowel preparation was finished and before coming to the hospital for the colonoscopy. Patient concerns or questions regarding the preparation were directed to the assistant as opposed to their gastroenterologist, so as to avoid unblinding the gastroenterologist. 2.1. Outcomes The previously validated Ottawa Bowel Preparation scale [ 29 ] was used to assess the quality of bowel cleanliness. Each of the right, mid, and rectosigmoid colons was rated on a 5-point scale (0?4). In addition, overall colonic fluid was assessed with a 3-point rating (0?2), resulting in an overall score range of 0 to 14. An excellent preparation with little fluid would have a score of 0 to 1 and a good preparation would have a score of 2 to 4. An adequate bowel preparation would have a score of 5 or lower and a completely unprepared colon would have a score of 11 to 14, depending on the amount of colonic fluid. Colonoscopy was performed in a standard fashion and endoscopists rated the bowel preparation quality during the procedure before any attempts to improve visualization and recorded the result on a separate standardized form. Secondary outcomes included a tolerability questionnaire, as well as patient and investigator reported adverse events. 2.2. Statistical Analyses Descriptive statistics were used for baseline characteristics. The Ottawa Bowel Preparation scale produces data that are approximately normally distributed. Two-group ANOVA was used to assess for the presence of group differences in the preparation scores while accounting for procedure time (AM versus PM). The proportion of adequate bowel preparation in each group was compared with a chi square statistic. The secondary endpoints of tolerability were assessed using the Mann-Whitney test. 2.3. Sample Size Calculation In our previous study using the Ottawa Bowel Preparation scale, an observed effect size of 1.0 was seen [ 27 ]. For a two-group ANOVA, a total sample size of 190 patients would be required for a two-tailed alpha at 0.05 and an 80% power. Based on experience from our previous study, an additional 20% of patients () were added to the total sample size to account for early withdrawals and incomplete colonoscopies. 3. Results In total, 249 patients were enrolled in the study: 125 in the split-dose group and 124 in the single-dose group; 237 completed the study, 115 patients in the single-dose group and 122 patients in the split-dose group. Discontinuations were due to scheduling conflicts. No adverse events causing discontinuations were reported. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the two groups. There were no significant differences between groups. In the split-dose group, 41% underwent afternoon colonoscopies compared with 40% in the single-dose group. Table 1: Baseline characteristics of the patients. The differences in Ottawa score between the two groups are illustrated in Figure 1 . In total, the bowel preparation was superior in the split-dose group compared with the single-dose group (mean Ottawa score: 3.50 ? 2.89 versus 5.96 ? 3.53; ). Split-dose PEG resulted in a lower, and therefore better, mean Ottawa score across all segments of the colon assessed as well as less overall fluid in the colon. This reached statistical significance for the total, right, and left colon. Furthermore, the split-dose group had a higher proportion of patients with adequate bowel preparation (Ottawa score < 6) than the single-dose group (76.2% versus 59.1%; ; Figure 2 ). Figure 1: Ottawa Bowel Prep scores for split-dose and single-dose PEG lavage groups by colon segment and overall. Lower scores are better. Figure 2: Proportion of patients with adequate bowel preparation (Ottawa Bowel Prep score <6) for split-dose and single-dose PEG lavage groups. Split preparations for morning procedures were performed only for those procedures after 10 AM, as earlier procedures were not feasible to have patients take an early morning dose of their preparation. In procedures performed in the morning, the split-dose PEG lavage resulted in a lower total Ottawa score compared with the single-dose lavage (mean total Ottawa score: 4.31 ? 3.13 versus 5.51 ? 3.61; ). The Ottawa score in the right colon was significantly better in the split-dose group than in the single-dose group (1.51 ? 1.06 versus 1.88 ? 1.08; ). The differences in Ottawa score between the two groups for morning procedures are illustrated in Table 2 . Table 2: Mean Ottawa scores parameters for morning procedures. The effect of the split-dose lavage compared with the single-dose lavage is amplified in the afternoon procedures. The total Ottawa score was far superior in the split-dose arm (2.34 ? 2.02 versus 6.63 ? 3.33, ) as were the independent assessments of the different colonic regions (right colon 0.82 versus 2.22; mid colon 0.58 versus 1.91; left colon 0.40 versus 1.52; all ). The differences in total Ottawa score with the split-dose and single-dose PEG lavage for both morning and afternoon procedures are illustrated in Figure 3 . Figure 3: Bowel preparation quality for AM (earlier than 10:00 AM) and PM (after 10:00 AM) procedures. All single-dose patients took their bowel preparation (4?L PEG) the day before the colonoscopy starting at noon for AM procedures and 6:00 PM for PM procedures. Split-dose patients took the second dose the evening before colonoscopy for AM procedures, or 5 hours before the colonoscopy time for PM procedures. Both preparations were generally well tolerated and completed as directed by the majority of participants (90% in split-dose group versus 85% in single-dose group; ). Questions regarding tolerability of the lavage preparations are shown in Table 3 . More patients who took the single 4?L lavage would rather have had a different preparation method compared with those who took the split dosing. The mean number of adverse events experienced during the lavage was higher in the single-dose group compared with the split-dose group (2.60 versus 2.01; ). Adverse event data are provided in Table 4 . Table 3: Questionnaire: patient opinion regarding the assigned bowel preparation. Table 4: Adverse events (group symptom score). 4. Discussion Administration of a PEG lavage in two 2?L doses is superior to administration in a single 4?L dose for screening colonoscopy in an outpatient population. The result is an overall better cleanliness in all regions of the colon as well as less residual fluid. While this holds true for procedures performed throughout the day, the effect is amplified when there is a shorter interval between the last dose of PEG and the procedure, as was the case in the afternoon procedures where the second PEG dose was given in the morning of the day of the procedure. In this situation, the difference in total Ottawa score between the split-dose and single-dose preparations was the greatest. While there was still a significant difference in morning procedures where the last PEG dose was given the evening before, the effect was less dramatic. This begs the question as to whether patients with morning procedures should be asked to take the second PEG dose 4-5 hours before the procedure rather than the evening before, at least in the setting of colorectal cancer screening. Clearly, this puts a significant added burden on patients with scheduled morning procedures. There are a variety of reasons as to why a split-dose administration of PEG is superior to a single-dose administration. The second dose of the split preparation is given closer to the procedure time than is the single dose. The result is likely a better removal of fluid and debris that may have accumulated in the hours since the first dose of the PEG lavage [ 22 , 30 , 31 ]. The single dose of PEG is almost always given the night before the procedure, leaving several hours since the laxative was administered for fluid, bile, and debris to accumulate. Therefore the bowel becomes less clean over time. Matro and colleagues have recently shown equivalency for morning only and a split-dose PEG preparation (PM/AM) for afternoon procedures, suggesting that the earlier dose may not even be required [ 25 ]. Another study found that maximal cleanliness of the bowel preparation was achieved when the colonoscopies were performed within 8 hours of the last laxative dose [ 30 ]. This notion is supported in our study by the superior bowel preparations in the afternoon procedures. The effect was less pronounced in the morning procedures likely because of the increased time between the second dose (evening before) and the colonoscopy time. In our study, afternoon procedure cases received the second dose of PEG 5 hours priorly. A better bowel preparation has been associated with higher cecal intubation rates and higher polyp detection rates [ 30 ]. In a study by Marmo et al., a split-dose PEG lavage outperformed a single-dose PEG lavage for colonoscopy. The improved bowel preparations were associated with a 5-fold increase in cecal intubation and a 2-fold increase in adenoma detection [ 30 ]. The superiority of the split-dose lavage in the right colon shown in this study and others [ 32 ] facilitates better identification of the serrated adenomas, which tend to be flat and more difficult to detect. Polyp and adenoma detection rates are typically descr...",0

Smart in India,"INVC NEWS New Delhi, World?s leading cardio and endovascular technology maker BIOTRONIK today introduced in India its latest and most advanced Home Monitoring Technology for patients with implanted cardiac devices such as pacemakers, implantable defibrillators (ICDs) and heart failure devices. BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring? is an internet based remote monitoring technology that enables physicians to continuously and reliably monitor their patients? clinical and device status anytime, anywhere, and minimize risk of any negative medical event. The latest device in the BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring? program, the CardioMessenger? Smart is about the size of a smartphone and is highly robust, more convenient and remarkably portable as compared to previous versions of the device. Having the pacemaker wearers constantly connected to their physician, this home monitoring technology enhances safety for cardiac device patients. The device provides fully automatic transmission of vital information from a patient?s cardiac implant to their physician via BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring?. Data are transmitted from the patient?s implant to the CardioMessenger??s transmitter device which uses T-Mobile and its partners? networks (GPRS) to send data to the BIOTRONIK Service Centre from where the data is sent to the physician. ?Home Monitoring has helped doctors world over to keep a very close look at their patients implanted devices and their cardiac activity. It has helped reduced mortality, episodes of hospitalizations and inappropriate shocks and helped improve the quality of life of patients immensely. It helps use of the full potential of the device that preserves battery life. It has also helped reduce routine clinic follow up, which can be a burden to patients and extra workload for physicians. These results formed basis for the Class I A indication, which means this is considered as standard of best care. This was the recommendation by the Heart Rhythm Society and is endorsed by the other professional societies around the world, including Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society.? said Dr Niraj Varma, Electrophysiologist at Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, USA who co-chaired this document. Dr Varma says Home Monitoring has clinically shown to have helped doctors provide improved services and helped better the health conditions of patients The CardioMessenger? Smart facilitates the application of Home Monitoring. Results from large clinical show the following benefits of Home Monitoring: Mortality in Heart Patients Less by 50% Hospitalizations due to atrial arrhythmia or stroke Less by 66% In-office follow ups Less by 55% Risk of inappropriate shocks in patients with implanted devices Less by 52% ?Another advantage of constant remote monitoring is that we as physicians get a closer look at trends in different patients. Some patients might have a more stable heart activity with a cardiac device; others may have more frequent discrepancies and episodes of arrhythmia. By regular monitoring data over a period of time, we can understand each patient and tailor our treatment and advice according to their needs and optimise device function. It also helps better our medical understanding and gives vital data for research. Regular monitoring of patients wearing pacemakers and other devices has traditionally been a cumbersome task since patients are required to visit clinics at regular intervals. In a country like India, where a patient from Bihar might have had a device implanted in Delhi, follow up visits can be very difficult. Sometimes, a medical event in between the visits could go unnoticed and be life threatening to the patient. Home Monitoring has made it easy, enhanced safety and also reduced cost? said Dr. Viveka Kumar, Senior Consultant Interventional Cardiologist & Director of the Cath Lab at Max Hospital, New Delhi. BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring? is the only remote monitoring system worldwide with US FDA and European CE approval to replace conventional in-office follow ups and provide early detection of clinically relevant cardiac events. It is the only system with fully automated data transmission. No patient interaction is needed, leading to the highest possible patient compliance. Physicians can define the events they wish to be notified with via email, sms or fax and view the events in order of importance. Regular data recording allows significant trend analysis, help physicians understand each patient?s condition and adjust their treatments accordingly. The process also allows better scheduling of follow-up appointments which may be skipped if not needed. ?Digital technology has drastically changed the way we live, and its impact on healthcare is also profoundly visible today. The Indian government special emphasis on Digital India shows how IT and digitization is inextricably linked to development. Digitization is bringing revolutionary changes to healthcare delivery across the world, including use of telemedicine to reach out to patients in remote areas and make diagnosis results quicker. At BIOTRONIK, we believe that digital technology can be effectively used to benefit a large number of patients. BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring? systems are leveraging this technology not only to improve healthcare delivery but also radically improve the quality of life of our patients. CardioMessenger? is the latest manifestation of how digital technology can benefit heart patients and help them live longer, more productive lives,? said Mr. Tushar Basu, Managing Director, BIOTRONIK India. Clinical studies have shown Home Monitoring makes patients feel more secure, improving their quality of life. 92% of patients surveyed said it gave them a sense of security, while 98% believed it had a positive impact on their health.",0

I don?t know why or what was in the way; it just seemed so ?useless and all? (Bob Dylan). I have struggled with disconnection my entire life: daydreaming, wandering in classrooms where I was meant to be paying attention, drugs and alcohol and an often conscious desire for a hard straight shot of oblivion, no ice no water. On May 1 of this year I was fifteen years clean and sober. During those years i have written as I alway meant to, with some success. I found entirely by accident that I had an inclination for photo journalism. It became my life passion in the form of building a career as an ultra-endurance event photographer. Several years ago I ran into an undiagnosed A-fib situation which resolved itself in a stroke, followed by two more events and a bout of congestive heart failure (scary shit that). Aside from the the obvious challenges involved in aging, combined with a little bit of bad luck or timing, as the case may be, my ability to keep shooting the events that allowed me to make a living, and to be me, disappeared. My used-to-be caught up with me as a silent daily lament. I was a ?good old wagon but Daddy, I done broke down,? an old song says. So now what? I HAVE TO WRITE!! is an enormous amount of pressure on a compromised system. So I began to go to the gym and rebuild. Every now and then I take my camera and shoot what?s around me; the images that follow are what I have seen with a camera in my hands. The other day I shot a local race event. These daily non-race images are markers of recovery, small celebrations of being present, doing what it is that I can do with what I got ? I think.

The spot is called Tomorrow and features Entresto users going about their daily routines while singing the song Tomorrow from the musical Annie. During a call with investors, David Epstein, the division head of Novartis Pharmaceuticals, said Entresto earned a ?modest? $17 million in sales during the first quarter of 2016, but sees significant growth potential in the U.S. for the drug as patient access improves. By the end of 2016, the drugmaker expects Entresto to generate $200 million in revenue. ?The first quarter was going to be tackling access barriers, which we accomplished,? Novartis CEO Joseph Jimenez said during the call. ?There still is prior authorization that's slowing some uptake as well as physician reluctance to switch stable patients, but we're working very hard on this and we're still very confident in long-term peak sales of Entresto just given the data on that drug.? Novartis' plans to promote Entresto are underway, with the DTC campaign and bringing in additional sales representatives. The drugmaker is also conducting two Phase III studies supporting new indications, including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and the prevention of heart failure and cardiovascular death post-myocardial infarction (HF post-MI). See also: Novartis says slow Entresto sales due to limited access The Swiss drugmaker said it anticipates that sales of Entresto and psoriasis skin treatment Cosentyx to offset losses from Gleevec. The loss of patent exclusivity for Gleevec in the U.S. contributed to its12% decrease in revenue in the first quarter of 2016. Sales of Gleevec dropped 22% after a generic version of the cancer drug launched in the U.S. on February 1. Jimenez said Cosentyx is ?doing extremely well.? Launched in February, the product made $176 million in revenue. The drugmaker credited long-term efficacy data for its strong growth. See also: Novartis: Cardiologists slow to advocate on behalf of new drugs ?We're outpacing competition with strong share gains in the psoriasis market,? said Jimenez. ?In Germany, we have already bypassed Stelara in terms of market share.

Forward this email to a friend Atrial Fibrillation: The Latest Management Strategies Straightforward answers to your questions about living with atrial fibrillation?the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia?with expert medical guidance incorporating recently updated clinical practice guidelines. Hugh Calkins, M.D. Professor of Cardiology Professor of Pediatrics Director of the Arrhythmia Service, Electrophysiology Lab, Atrial Fibrillation Center at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. and Ronald Berger, M.D., Ph.D. Professor of Professor of Medicine and Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University * * * * * * * * * * * * If you've ever run up a flight of stairs, chased a tennis ball across the court or reacted in fright at a scary movie, you know what a pounding heart feels like... But for the 2.6 million Americans who suffer from atrial fibrillation (AF or AFib), a racing heart is a way of life. Simple tasks like getting out of bed in the morning or rising from a chair can cause dizziness, weakness, shortness of breath or heart palpitations. For these people, AF severely impairs quality of life?and even when symptoms stemming from AF are mild, the disorder can seriously impact health, increasing the risk of stroke and heart failure. AF can be a debilitating even deadly condition. Fortunately, it can be successfully managed?but there are various approaches for treating AF or preventing a recurrence. How do you and your doctor choose which approach is right for you? If you or a loved one has AF, there are so many questions: Do I need an anticoagulant... should I be taking medication to control my heart rate... will my symptoms respond to cardioversion... if I need an antiarrhythmic drug to control AF episodes, which one should I take... when is an ablation procedure appropriate... and more. It's critically important to learn everything you can now?so you can partner with your doctor effectively, ask the right questions and understand the answers. To help you, we asked two eminent experts to share their expertise and hands-on experience with arrhythmia patients in an important Special Health Report, Atrial Fibrillation: The Latest Management Strategies. Introducing Your Atrial Fibrillation Expert Dr. Hugh Calkins, M.D., is the Nicholas J. Fortuin, M.D., Professor of Cardiology, Professor of Pediatrics, and Director of the Arrhythmia Service, the Electrophysiology Lab, and the Atrial Fibrillation Center at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. He has clinical and research interests in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias with catheter ablation, the role of device therapy for treating ventricular arrhythmias, the evaluation and management of syncope, and the study of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. Dr. Calkins has authored more than 500 manuscripts and book chapters, and he is a member of the editorial boards of five major cardiology journals. He was lead author of the 2007 and 2012 HRS/EHRA/ECAS Consensus Documents on Catheter and Surgical Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation, and more recently he was a member of the writing committee for the updated atrial fibrillation guidelines issued jointly in 2014 by the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society. In 2013 Dr. Calkins served as president of the Heart Rhythm Society, an international organization of more than 5,800 specialists in heart rhythm disorders. Dr. Ronald Berger, M.D., Ph.D., a Professor of Medicine and Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, is Director of the Electrophysiology Fellowship Program and Co-director of the Electrophysiology Service at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. He serves on the editorial boards of three major journals in the cardiovascular field, has authored more than 250 articles and book chapters, and holds over 30 patents on methods and devices used in electrophysiology diagnosis and treatment. Along with Dr. Hugh Calkins, Dr. Berger and his colleagues perform approximately 3,500 electrophysiology procedures and 500 atrial fibrillation ablation procedures each year. Recently, there have been important revisions to clinical practice guidelines for managing AF. Atrial Fibrillation: The Latest Management Strategies makes use of these new guidelines to provide you with current information on the newest drugs, treatments and research data. ""I feel like my heart is going to jump out of my chest..."" An arrhythmia is an abnormality in the timing or pattern of the heartbeat, causing the heart to beat too rapidly, too slowly, or irregularly. Sounds pretty straightforward, but there's a lot we don't know about why the heart rhythm goes awry... or the best way to treat it. In Atrial Fibrillation: The Latest Management Strategies, we focus on what we DO know. In page after page of this comprehensive report, we address your most serious concerns about living with AF, such as: I don't have any symptoms. Is my problem definitely AF?Can drinking alcohol trigger or worsen AF? What about extra weight?Is every person who has AF at risk for a stroke?If my doctor suspects AF, will I have to wear an implantable or event monitor to be sure?Why does AF often show up later in life?What would you recommend to the older patient?75 and older?who has AF but no bothersome symptoms?What do you recommend for the person with longstanding persistent AF?Is the AF experienced by an otherwise healthy person different from that of a person with underlying heart disease or other health issues?What are the differences among: paroxysmal AF, persistent AF and longstanding persistent AF?What options are available for controlling my AF symptoms?What if antiarrhythmic medication fails to suppress AF episodes? Anticoagulation Therapy: What You Should Know While AF is generally not life threatening, for some patients it can increase the likelihood of blood clots forming in the heart. And if a clot travels to the brain, a stroke will result. Anticoagulation therapy is used to prevent blood clot formation in people with AF?but it is no longer restricted to the mainstay blood thinner warfarin (Coumadin). Three new anticoagulants have now been approved by the FDA?Pradaxa, Xarelto and Eliquis. Atrial Fibrillation: The Latest Management Strategies discusses the pros and cons of each so you'll be in a position to discuss your drug choices with your doctor. In addition, you'll find answers to key questions about anticoagulation therapy, including: Why is anticoagulation therapy with warfarin still necessary for some people with AF?How do you decide between warfarin and one of the newer anticoagulants in newly diagnosed patients?Do the newer drugs have any downsides in comparison with warfarin?What's the CHA2DS2-VASc score and how is it used?Why is it so difficult to keep within therapeutic range with warfarin?How is the HAS-BLED bleeding risk score used in prescribing anticoagulant therapy?Can I test my INR (a test measuring how long it takes blood to clot) at home?What happens if my INR is too high?Is there still a role for antiplatelet therapy in AF-related stroke prevention?Is there a point when a patient can stop anticoagulant therapy? Symptom Control: The Art of Rate and Rhythm Control For many patients and their doctors, it's difficult to achieve and maintain heart rhythm. Two key management strategies are used: heart rate and heart rhythm control. In Atrial Fibrillation: The Latest Management Strategies, you'll read an in-depth discussion of the effects of rate versus rhythm control for AF?and who the appropriate candidates are for each strategy: What have we learned from the AFFIRM study, and how has this knowledge affected the management of AF?What is catheter ablation of the AV (atrioventricular) node?Why is cardioversion needed?Are there different types of cardioversion?What is chemical cardioversion? What is electrical cardioversion?Can medication be used to convert the heart back to normal sinus rhythm?Which antiarrhythmic drugs are most commonly used to treat AF?When is catheter ablation of AF an option?and how is it performed?Who are the best candidates for catheter ablation of AF?What can be done if catheter ablation isn't successful? There's More to Atrial Fibrillation: The Latest Management Strategies, much more. We explain surgical ablation of AF, a procedure performed through small incisions in the chest wall... discuss when it's appropriate to seek a second opinion... take a close look at strokes and explain the warning signs and differences among ischemic, thrombotic, embolic and hemorrhagic strokes... provide a chart of current drug therapy strategies to maintain sinus rhythm... and include an arrhythmia glossary of key AF terms used by electrophysiologists and cardiologists.

Sure, juices have some Vitamin C, but no one on a Crystal cruise is in much danger of getting scurvy anyway. Fruit juices cause an unhealthy spike in blood sugar which results in wide swings in serum insulin levels, possibly setting the stage for insulin-resistance and diabetes. Better to eat an occasional orange, which is more filling and less prone to result in these metabolic disturbances. On the other hand, vegetable juices, in general, are significantly lower in sugar and calories, and have many micro-nutrients, including Vitamin C. They tend to have quite a bit of sodium, but that isn't a problem for most people unless they have uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, kidney disease or liver disease.

If somebody isn't used to cold water, it doesn't take long for swimming ability to degrade as co-ordination is lost. Two years ago I was hospitalised with acute heart failure and immediately afterwards had difficulty swimming a few widths before becoming breathless.

I can understand your concern. Yes, these symptoms are worrisome in your case. Your heart is working only 30%. This can cause heart failure and retention of fluid in the body. This excess fluid accumulate in the lungs and cause pulmonary edema. This is the reason for your breathlessness and other chest symptoms. So along with other drugs, you should also start diuretics and cardiac inotropic drugs.

HUMIRA can be used alone, with methotrexate, or with certain other medicines. HUMIRA may prevent further damage to bones and joints and may help the ability to perform daily activities. Moderate to severe polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children 2 years of age and older. HUMIRA can be used alone, with methotrexate, or with certain other medicines. Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adults. HUMIRA can be used alone or with certain other medicines. HUMIRA may prevent further damage to bones and joints and may help the ability to perform daily activities. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in adults. Moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) and to achieve and maintain clinical remission in adults who have not responded well to conventional treatments. HUMIRA is also used to reduce signs and symptoms and to achieve clinical remission in these adults who have lost response to or are unable to tolerate infliximab. Moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) and to achieve and maintain clinical remission in children 6 years of age and older when certain other treatments have not worked well enough. Moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in adults. In adults, to help get moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) under control (induce remission) and keep it under control (sustain remission) when certain other medicines have not worked well enough. It is not known if HUMIRA is effective in people who stopped responding to or could not tolerate anti-TNF medicines. To treat moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis (Ps ) in adults who are ready for systemic therapy or phototherapy, and are under the care of a doctor who will decide if other systemic therapies are less appropriate. Important Safety Information 4 HUMIRA is a TNF blocker medicine that affects the immune system and can lower the body's ability to fight infections. Serious infections have happened in people taking HUMIRA. These serious infections include tuberculosis (TB) and infections caused by viruses, fungi, or bacteria that have spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. People should be tested for TB before HUMIRA use and monitored for signs and symptoms of TB during therapy. People at risk of TB may be treated with medicine for TB. Treatment with HUMIRA should not be started in a person with an active infection, unless approved by a doctor. HUMIRA should be stopped if a person develops a serious infection. People should tell their doctor if they live in or have been to a region where certain fungal infections are common, have had TB or hepatitis B, are prone to infections, or have symptoms such as fever, fatigue, cough, or sores. For people taking TNF blockers, including HUMIRA, the chance of getting lymphoma or other cancers may increase. Some people have developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. This type of cancer often results in death. If using TNF blockers, including HUMIRA, the chance of getting two types of skin cancer (basal cell and squamous cell) may increase. These types are generally not life-threatening if treated. Other possible serious side effects with HUMIRA include hepatitis B infection in carriers of the virus; allergic reactions; nervous system problems; blood problems; certain immune reactions, including a lupus-like syndrome; liver problems; and new or worsening heart failure or psoriasis. The use of HUMIRA with anakinra or abatacept is not recommended. People using HUMIRA should not receive live vaccines. Common side effects of HUMIRA include injection site reactions (redness, rash, swelling, itching, or bruising), upper respiratory infections (including sinus infections), headaches, rash, and nausea. HUMIRA is given by injection under the skin. The benefits and risks of HUMIRA should be carefully considered before starting therapy.

First, of all, let me mention that I've had palpitations for years. In 2014, I had an EKG and Holter monitor which both came back normal. But, I also had a stress test, which revealed a congenital heart defect that I never knew I had. It's a BAV (Bicuspid Aortic Valve). Apparently, I was on the mild end of any problems and my cardiologist told me to just continue what I do and not to have any restrictions on anything and follow up in two years. He also mentioned that this sort of thing does not cause pain and that I wouldn't just drop dead (yes, I asked about that) haha... However, over time, this could lead to heart failure but that would be at the extreme end of things and I would definitely know before that point because I would have trouble even walking across the room. So, here is my question. I am getting ready to start an exercise program but haven't exercised in about a year. So, I'm definitely not in shape, however, I'm not considered really overweight either. Last week, I did two short minute long tabata exercises and noticed that when I just stood and slowly jumped side to side and did a boxing type punch, I felt like I had no air to breath in and this wheezing sound came out of me. Almost like if someone knocked the wind out of you or you pushed the air out of something really fast. I don't experience that any other time but when I'm doing that punching type move. Is that shortness of breath? I have no idea what I should look for or feel but it's a very weird feeling. It also concerns me that maybe I shouldn't jump into this upcoming exercise routine. But, another part of me is saying that I haven't been exercising in a long time and that I could simply be out of shape. I do have a two year follow up with my cardiologist next month and will mention this but just wanted to know if any of you have experienced anything like this before. Thank you for your thoughts.",1

Better late than never. Only problem is they are steering pain sufferers towards NASAIDs, acetaminophen and ibuprofen which all have a record of causing serious health issues. Gee, it would sure be nice if there was a pain reliever available that had zero deaths from use, zero addiction, zero side effects and was inexpensive, say around 5 cents per hour of relief. [b]The most common side effects of NSAIDs are:[/b] ? vomiting, ? nausea, ? constipation, ? diarrhea, ? reduced appetite, ? headache, ? dizziness, ? rash, and ? drowsiness. NSAIDs also may cause swelling of the arms and legs due to the retention of fluid from their renal effects. The most serious side effects are ulcers, bleeding, kidney failure, and, rarely, liver failure. Individuals allergic to NSAIDs may experience shortness of breath after taking an NSAID and may experience a similar reaction when other NSAIDs are taken. People with asthma are at higher risk for experiencing serious allergic reactions to NSAIDs. [b]Tylenol (acetaminophen)[/b] is the most popular over-the-counter (OTC) pain relief medication used in the United States and around the world. Tylenol is not without its serious complications. It is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States, and the drug in some cases led to fatalities. The active ingredient in Tylenol, acetaminophen, accounts for more than 100,000 calls to poison centers, roughly 60,000 emergency-room visits and hundreds of deaths each year in the United States. In England, it is the leading cause of liver failure requiring transplants. In 2009, the FDA issued guidelines for adding overdose guidelines to packages and in 2011, the agency confirmed the link between the drug and liver damage. [b]The most common side effects from ibuprofen are:[/b] rash, ringing in the ears, headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and heartburn. Ibuprofen may cause ulceration of the stomach or intestine, and the ulcers may bleed. Sometimes, ulceration can occur without abdominal pain; and due to bleeding, the only signs or symptoms of an ulcer may be black, tarry stools, weakness, and dizziness upon standing (orthostatic hypotension).NSAIDs reduce the flow of blood to the kidneys and impair function of the kidneys. The impairment is most likely to occur in patients who already have impaired function of the kidney or congestive heart failure, and use of NSAIDs in these patients should be cautious.",0

The heart pumps blood into the arteries, which carry the blood throughout the body. High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is dangerous because it makes the heart work harder to pump blood to the body and contributes to hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis and to the development of heart failure. High blood pressure is rarely accompanied by any symptoms, and its identification is usually through screening, or when seeking healthcare for an unrelated problem.

I did that. I had highest possible dosage to kill my thyroid.

It?s time to change that. What is heart failure? When you have heart failure, your heart has weakened. It is not pumping blood around your body as efficiently as it should. A weakened heart has to pump extra hard to supply your body with the oxygen and nutrients it needs. This extra work can enlarge and damage it even further. The most common symptoms of heart failure are: - Shortness of breath or trouble breathing - Weakness, fatigue - Swollen feet, ankles, abdomen, or veins in the neck Other symptoms may include: - Rapid weight gain - Difficulty moving - Heart palpitations - Nausea/vomiting - Coughing Tags:  Published: Sat Apr 30 08:09:38 EDT 2016",0
BLOG,http://davidwolfe.com,http://www.davidwolfe.com/5-habits-decrease-heart-attack-80/,6/20/2016,21:01:27,6/21/2016 6:31,5 Habits that Decrease Your Risk of Heart Attack by 80%,"Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States. Every year, about 735,000 Americans experience a heart attack. Of these, 525,000 are a first heart attack, while 210,000 occur in men and women who have previously suffered a heart attack. A heart attack occurs when the blood flow that brings oxygen to the heart muscle becomes severely reduced or cut off completely. This happens when coronary arteries that supply the heart muscle with blood flow become narrow due to a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances, collectively called plaque. About every 43 seconds, someone in the United States has a heart attack. Actively working to prevent a heart attack is necessary to maintain your overall health and lower your risk of heart disease. Making smart lifestyle choices now, regardless of your age, will pay off for the rest of your life. A study conducted at the Karolinska Institute found that engaging in these five healthy lifestyle habits could prevent nearly 80% of first-time heart attacks: 1. Maintain a Healthy Diet Choose foods that are low in saturated fats, trans fats and sodium. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, fiber-rich whole grains, and limit your meat intake. If you choose to eat meat, select the leanest cuts available. Limiting sugar intake is also vital to preventing heart disease. A study published in JAMA: Internal Medicine, found that those who got 17-21% of calories from added sugar had a 38% higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, compared to those who consumed only 8% of their calories from added sugar. You may also want to consider adding certain foods to your diet that can help unclog arteries. 2. Exercise An inactive lifestyle is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. Regular exercise helps reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel disease, while controlling blood cholesterol, diabetes and obesity. Lowering body weight, blood pressure and insulin sensitivity through regular exercise can help dramatically reduce your chances of developing heart disease and experiencing a heart attack. 3. Ditch the Alcohol Drinking alcohol excessively can lead to serious health problems, including high blood pressure, heart failure and stroke. If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. The recommended amount is no more than one drink a day for women of all ages and men older than age 65, and no more than two drinks a day for men under the age of 65. Drinking too much alcohol can raise the levels of triglycerides in the blood, possibly leading to high blood pressure and heart failure. 4. Quit Smoking A smoker?s risk of developing coronary heart disease is much high than a non-smoker?s. Cigarette smoking is a main risk factor for sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary heart disease, and it also acts with other risk factors to greatly increase heart disease risk. Quitting smoking can improve your HDL cholesterol levels. Within on year of quitting, you can reduce your risk of heart disease to half of that of a smoker, and within 15 years, your risk of heart disease will be similar to someone who never smoked. It?s never too late to quit. 5. Maintain a Healthy Weight People who are overweight or obese are much more likely to develop heart disease, even if they have no other risk factors. Being obese can raise blood cholesterol and trigylceride levels, lower good cholesterol levels, increase blood pressure and even induce diabetes. Choosing healthy foods and being physically active can help you lose weight and lower your risk of a heart attack. Many foods promote heart health, including avocados!

Two ""quantum leaps"" occurred in the late 19th century, which together allowed the transition to modern surgery. The first great advancement was the discovery and use of anesthesia especially Ether to enable the surgeon to work without causing pain and the inevitable accompanying shock which would be life threatening. Subsequent new agents and newer delivery methods have eliminated the bad effects of the original drugs. An appreciation of the germ theory of disease led rapidly to the development and application of antiseptic techniques in surgery. Antisepsis, which soon gave way to asepsis, reduced the overall morbidity and mortality of surgery to a far more acceptable rate than in previous eras. The next major advancement was as the result of the Spanish Civil War when an understanding of shock and its treatment in traumatic injuries proved to be lifesaving. In the post WWII era starting in the late 50s a combination of better anesthesia techniques and shock support plus a better understand of the body?s hemostasis led to greater surgical advances to the point where we can now even transplant organs. Included in these advancement were the use of new visual tools as well as the computer and micro-surgical development; so called non-invasive. The first Heart valve replacement happen in the 1960?s It was a rather brutal procedure and took a such a great toll on the body that the majority who needed the operation the most; especially the elderly (over 70) had little chance of surviving the operation. I am unawares of anyone in the 80s being offered the procedure. The operation was done by splitting the sternum (breast bone) down the middle. Then the heart is exposed, the pericardium is opened, and the patient is put on a cardiopulmonary bypass machine, also known as the heart-lung machine. This machine takes over the task of breathing for the patient and pumping their blood around while the surgeon replaces the heart valve. Before its invention the heart continued to beat and made it difficult to place the valve. A further advancement was the addition of the use of hypothermia; lowering the body temperature. Early adoption of this technique proceeded slowly based on the limitations of available replacement valves and relatively primitive techniques for protecting the heart during surgery which were available at the time. With the evolution of mechanical heart valves and gradual developments in cardiopulmonary bypass (the heart lung machine) and cardioplegia which allow the heart to be stopped safely during surgery, aortic valve replacement became accepted therapy for patients with severe aortic insufficiency and /or regurgitation. Once the patient is on bypass, a cut is made in the aorta and a cross clamp applied. The surgeon then removes the patient's diseased aortic valve and a mechanical or tissue valve is put in its place. Once the valve is in place and the aorta has been closed, the patient is taken off the heart-lung machine. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE, an ultra-sound of the heart done through the esophagus) can be used to verify that the new valve is functioning properly. Pacing wires are usually put in place, so that the heart can be manually paced should any complications arise after surgery. Drainage tubes are also inserted to drain fluids from the chest and pericardium following surgery. These are usually removed within 36 hours while the pacing wires are generally left in place until right before the patient is discharged from the hospital. Recovery from this operation usually takes about 3 months or more. As medical procedures evolved cardiac cauterization became standard and not only could the heart?s blood vessels be visualized but the placing of stents instead of open heart coronary heart surgery became possible and a common treatment. In 2011 only 5 years ago, the first aortic valve was replaced by using a catheter inserted through the femoral artery and passed into the heart. Hospitalization was now no more than 5 days if there were no complications which were much less than in open heart replacement. Now those in the 80s could be treated instead of facing rapid progress heart failure. Within a week or two the patient could depending on his/heir?s status resume normal life. These valves folded up so that they could be passed through the catheter and were then open when in the area of the valve to be replaced and anchored into position. They consisted of a metal framework covered with a ?plastic and the valve itself was usual from pig tissue. The metal frame help anchor the valve in place. The operation is called Trans Aortic Valve replacement (TAVR). Today a new and better valve for many reasons is undergoing clinical trial in the USA although it has been in use in Europe for about 2 years. It has no metal and is secured in place by expanding it as if it were a balloon and then hardening polymer is injected to fix it in place. If the surgeon does not like its initial positioning he deflates the balloon and reposition it under the ultrasound and fluoroscope guidance before injecting the fixing agent. It will be only be a matter of time when all valve replacement will be done by this less traumatic method.",0

""If you don't feel well, you should seek treatment,"" she said. ""The longer you delay treatment, the longer it will take for you to get better."" Eating high-salt foods, lack of exercise and the stress of traveling during the holidays may contribute to the spike in hospital admissions, study coauthor Dr. Mahek Shah from the Lehigh Valley Hospital Network in Pennsylvania told Reuters Health by phone.

Think of it this way, your blood pressure represents in one respect the force your heart has to overcome to push blood around your body. This isn't a bad thing if it's intermittent, for example when your blood pressure is higher during exercise. But if it's 24/7 that appears to predispose a person to damage their blood vessels leading to atherosclerosis and it also can lead to an enlarged diseased heart and ultimately heart failure. Your blood pressure is the product of cardiac output (how much blood is being pumped) and total peripheral resistance (in essence the volume of blood vessels the blood is being pushed through. Stress induces a sympathetic nervous system response in your body that increases cardiac output by causing your heart to beat faster and harder, and causes vasoconstriction around the body which lowers the volume of the ""tubes"" for the blood to travel through, thereby increasing total peripheral resistance, hence it increases blood pressure. And yes a lot of high blood pressure has nothing to do with lifestyle.",0

THE Chief Medical Officer in the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Eldery and Children, Professor Mohammad Kambi, has said that non-communicable diseases are becoming more noticeable in the country as compared to communicable diseases due to the lifestyle modification. He said in the group of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD), cardiovascular diseases are currently among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the country. He said the increase of the diseases are being fomented by the lifestyle modification of Tanzanians. ?I have been informed that according to projections by the World Health Organisation (WHO), in 10 years to come cardiovascular diseases will account for 20 per cent of deaths. In Tanzania, such projections put a figure of over one million people dying from cardiovascular diseases in the next 10 years,? he said. Professor Kambi made the remarks in Dar es Salaam yesterday when he was a guest of honour during the opening ceremony of the first Tanzania Cardiac Society conference collaboration with the Pan African Society of Cardiology (PASCAR) heart failure task force. According to him, in 2008, NDCs accounted for an estimated 36 million deaths or 63 per cent of 57 million deaths that occurred globally, comprising mainly cardiovascular diseases 48 per cent, cancers 21 per cent and chronic respiratory diseases 12 per cent. Kambi said it is further estimated that Tanzania will lose 100 million US dollars in national income from premature deaths due to heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Worse still, these losses are projected to continue to increase cumulatively, unless something drastic happens. ?Tanzania stands to lose 3 billion US dollars over the next 10 years from premature deaths due to lose cardiovascular ailments,? he said. The President of Tanzania Cardiac Society (TCS), Dr Robert Mvungi, said the aim of the conference is to discuss with stakeholders from various regions in Africa on how to decrease the non-communicable diseases. He also said the government has done well for the construction of the Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute (JKCI) because it will help to combat and decrease the non-communicable diseases. The Executive Director of JKCI, Professor Mohamed Janabi, said 80 per cent of operations conducted at the institution are associated with inborn diseases. He has advised pregnant women focus on vaccines to prevent children being born with inherited diseases",0

Is there a link to see what disabilities qualify for a DAS? My disability is not visible. I have a Congenital Heart Defect We're planning on going in early October because we'll be there for a Conference and I know it can still be very hot and humid then. I'm already in stage 3 Congestive Heart Failure and in the early stages of beginning testing for transplant. Standing on my feet for long periods of time in a person with CHF can cause fluid retention and make it worse, especially when it's hot. I don't need a scooter or a wheelchair. Walking and moving isn't my problem. It's the heat and humidity while standing in line for long periods of time. Thanks in advance for anyone's input! Click to expand... I would suggest talking to your doctor before going to WDW. Although walking may be fine in your normal, everyday life, most people don't walk 5-9 miles a day. So, your doctor may have some helpful suggestions. Every guest has 3 Fastpasses the can pre-arrange and after those have been used, guests can arrange more one at a time. The attractions with the longest waits in line tend to be the 'thrill' rides. Most of the thrill rides have a warning against riding for people with heart conditions. You can find a list of those attractions, along with a bit more information in a post on page 2 of the disABILITIES FAQs thread. They are also marked with a special caution icon on park maps, the My Disney Experience app and signs near the entrance to the attraction. I'd suggest also discussing those attractions with your doctor to determine whether the doctor thinks it would be safe for you to ride. Most of the time, guests are not standing still in line; most lines are moving slowly forward all the time. The times you will be standing still will mostly not be impacted by DAS that much. That's because the standing wait is usually part of a preshow or an attraction that loads in 'batches' of people. There is a post on page 2 of the disABILITIES FAQs thread that talks about attractions where all guests have to stand unless they have brought a mobility device with them in line. There are no disabilities that 'qualify' for DAS; it is based on the person's needs while waiting in lines. This is from the WDW DAS thread which is stuck near the top of this board: person the DAS is being requested for needs to be present, even if they can't talk - you will be asked about your/the person's needs related to disability, not your diagnosis - you may be asked ""why are you requesting it?"" - this does not mean they are asking what your disability is; they want to know what your needs are. - For example, diabetes, autism and fibromylagia are not disabilities - they (like Cerebral Palsy, that is one of the conditions my DD has) are conditions that can cause a disability. Not everyone with a condition has a disability. So, your task will be to explain how your conditions affect you in a way that causes a need for accommodations IN LINES. - different people with the same diagnosis can have very different needs - no proof or doctor's note is needed, and CMs have been instructed they will not be looked at - explain your needs clearly, calmly and concisely. - include details the CMs will need, but don't include details that are not pertinent to waiting or accessing attractions. *posters, please do not post exactly what you said to get a DAS - people need to explain their own needs.",1

After the ultrasound check, etc by their lab, I was diagnosed with Venous Insufficiency, mild varicose veins and Lymphedema. Their suggestion to me was to wear 'compression hose' daily.

Searchers have found one of the six crew members from a Japanese military jet that disappeared a day earlier while flying over southern mountains. The Defense Ministry said rescue workers are still searching for the jet and the five other crew members Thursday. Only parts of equipment belonging to the jet and the airman, who was in a state of heart failure, were found in the mountains near the Air Self-Defense Force's Kanoya base in southern Japan. The ministry said the U-125 search-and-rescue jet disappeared from radar Wednesday while flying 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the base. The twin-engine jet, piloted by a major in his 40s, was on a planned three-hour flight inspecting aircraft navigation facilities in the region. Members of the Japan Self-Defense Forces resume a search operation for a disapeared Japanese military jet carrying six airmen, in Kanoya city, Kagoshima prefecture, southern Japan, Thursday, April 7, 2016. The military jet carrying six airmen disappeared from radar over southern Japan on Wednesday afternoon, and the search has been suspended for the night. The plane disappeared about an hour after takeoff from Kanoya base for what was supposed to be a three-hour flight, the Defense Ministry said.

I'm pescatarian so my challenge has been finding protein but I've done just fine with that (fish, eggs, cheese > boom). Came time for our annual blood test at work and through this and other keto resources, discovered that the NMR LipoProfile test is a much better pointer to potential heart issues than the standard-issue cholesterol test that's offered for free. So I put one on my FSA thinking that because I am in weight-loss mode with keto, that my standard test will show higher LDLs and I wanted to focus in a little tighter with a more relevant test. Well the standard issue test doesn't actually show much difference from last year: Triglycerides have gone up a little, HDL has actually gone down a little, LDL down a little, total cholesterol down by 10. Not bad. But then I get my NMR results and whoa. The acceptable range of the LDL-P particle number is below 1000 - I am above 1800. My doctor is calling and made me an appt. I know she's going to push the statins, she's that kind of doctor (lovely woman, super smart, heart of gold, education pretty limited to what they offer in med school). I, of course am going to push back, decline statins - at least for now - and offer to change my diet. Which means backing off of saturated fats. Sigh. I have coffee with HWC for breakfast (I don't do BPC), I liberally use butter, cream cheese, full-fat cheese, tuna almost everyday, eggs, etc. I've taken this WOE to heart. (Pun noted.) I know there are good fats and bad fats and what I'm wondering, when I promise my doctor I'll make some changes without changing the WOE, is what should I be dropping or at least using a lot less and what I should be increasing for fats. I know I can ask her these questions but she's not a fan of the HF part of this and I expect her response to be go low-fat and that's a non-starter and not gonna happen. So I'm looking for advice on what I can change and still remain in-macro and also how long I should give these changes before re-testing to see if they've worked.",0

Coronary heart disease is America?s #1 killer. Stroke is #5, which can also cause serious disability. Knowing the signs and symptoms of heart conditions, and how to respond quickly and effectively, is important in our daily lives. Although some heart attacks occur suddenly, most begin slowly, with only mild pain and discomfort. These symptoms may be taken lightly and help may not be sought in time. Signs of a heart attack may include the following: Discomfort in the center of the chest that?s either constant, or comes and goes. This discomfort can be in the form of pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. Chest discomfort is the most common heart attack symptom among men and women. Discomfort in other areas such as the arms, neck, jaw, or stomach. Shortness of breath. Cold sweats, lightheadedness, nausea. Women are somewhat more likely than men to experience the other signs of heart attack listed above. Cardiac arrest occurs immediately. Here are some of the signs: Sudden unresponsiveness. Abnormal breathing ? normal breath not taken when head is tilted up, and checked for at least 5 seconds. Stroke warning signs include any of the following, sudden changes: Numbness or weakness in the arm, leg, or face ? especially on one side of the body. Confusion ? trouble understanding or verbalizing thoughts. Vision difficulty in one or both eyes. Trouble walking, loss of balance or coordination. Severe headache with unknown cause. Don?t wait more than five minutes to call 911- fast action saves lives! For more information on heart conditions: http://www.americanheart.org.

It also possesses an extranuclear function in which cytosolic p53 inhibits the process of autophagy by a poorly known mechanism (7). We have previously demonstrated the contribution of p53 to mitochondrial integrity. p53 is required for mitochondrial aerobic respiration through the expression of SCO2 (8). Conversely, cytosolic p53 has been shown to disturb the clearance of damaged mitochondria by an inhibitory interaction with Parkin (9). Other recent studies have also revealed that p53 has a distinct cellular function according to its cellular concentration and distribution (10). Thus, p53-mediated inhibition of mitophagy modulates cardiac dysfunction, raising the possibility that therapeutic activation of mitophagy by inhibiting cytosolic p53 may ameliorate heart failure and symptoms of cardiac ageing. And some insight about yet another way Metformin might work by decreasing p53 expression, inducing mitophagy: Cytosolic p53 inhibited mitophagy by disturbing the mitochondrial translocation of Parkin, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. However, metformin decreased ER stress and p53 expression, resulting in induction of Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Furthermore, pifithrin-?, a specific inhibitor of p53, increased mitochondrial incorporation into autophagosomes. Taken together, these results indicate that metformin treatment facilitates Parkin-mediated mitophagy rather than mitochondrial spheroid formation by decreasing the inhibitory interaction with cytosolic p53 and increasing degradation of mitofusins. Increased p53 is seen in senescent insulin resistant adipocytes (http://www.ncbi.nlm....pubmed/19718037) Inhibition of p53 activity in adipose tissue markedly ameliorated these senescence-like changes, decreased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and improved insulin resistance in mice with type 2 diabetes-like disease. Conversely, upregulation of p53 in adipose tissue caused an inflammatory response that led to insulin resistance. Adipose tissue from individuals with diabetes also showed senescence-like features. Our results show a previously unappreciated role of adipose tissue p53 expression in the regulation of insulin resistance and suggest that cellular aging signals in adipose tissue could be a new target for the treatment of diabetes (pages 996-967). So this may be either the way or another way Metformin works in reducing hyperglycemia. Basically, what this might say is that p53 is (sometimes) inhibiting mitophagy, and bad mitochondria cannot be removed. p53 has put the cell into a senescent state, and it's not doing you any good, either. All the COQ10, buckyballs, and mitoQ won't beat the process of getting rid of the bad mitochondria to begin with. It's interesting, that ""p53 amyloids/aggregates"" also exist, but this is possibly unrelated: http://www.ncbi.nlm....pubmed/22715097. ""Other recent studies have also revealed that p53 has a distinct cellular function according to its cellular concentration and distribution (10)."" This probably does have implications for Parkinsons.",0

And only about half of them have their condition under control. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can cause damage to the body, and even become fatal An even scarier fact ? high blood pressure is a condition that usually shows little to no symptoms. If you don?t check on your blood pressure because you assume symptoms will alert you if something is wrong, you?re most likely taking a dangerous chance that could cost you your life. Research shows that over half of people with high blood pressure are completely unaware of it! In severe cases of high blood pressure, symptoms may appear. Signs of a serious hypertension problem include: Feeling confused or other neurological symptoms Nosebleeds Fatigue Blurred vision Chest pain Abnormal heartbeat Health consequences that may occur if high blood pressure is left untreated include: Damage to the heart and coronary arteries ? this can include a heart attack, heart disease, congestive heart failure, aortic dissection and atherosclerosis (the hardening of arteries) Stroke Kidney damage Loss of vision Memory loss Fluid in the lungs Angina Peripheral artery disease Risk Factors for High Blood Pressure Since high blood pressure may not show symptoms to alert you that something is wrong, it?s important to know the risk factors for developing hypertension, and learn how to prevent it. There are several factors that you may have no control over. A family history of high blood pressure puts you at a higher risk, as does aging and even sleep apnea. Other risk factors can be controlled. These include: 1. Lack of Physical Activity Exercising on a regular basis is beneficial to your health in so many ways. It helps keep your heart and circulatory system healthy. An inactive lifestyle increases your risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, blood vessel disease and stroke. Staying active will also help you to stay at a healthy weight and improve your overall health. 2. Poor Diet Shuffling fast food, processed food and soda into your body is similar to treating it like a trash can. Caring for your body involves eating a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, essential nutrients and drinking plenty of water. A diet high in calories, fat, salt and sugar puts you at a higher risk for high blood pressure and a long list of other health problems. 3. Heavy Alcohol Use Heavy and regular alcohol consumption can dramatically increase blood pressure. It can also lead to heart failure, stroke and irregular heartbeats. Overloading your body with alcohol can contribute to high triglycerides, cancer and other disease. Preventing High Blood Pressure Blood pressure levels vary by age, race and ethnicity. Check in with a health care professional to determine where your blood pressure levels are versus where they should be. The main ways to manage your blood pressure are to eat a healthy diet and control salt intake, participate in regular physical activity, maintain a healthy weight, manage stress, avoid smoking and limit alcohol. Research has shown that in order to lower blood pressure naturally, it?s important to choose foods that are naturally low in sodium and high in at least two of these three minerals: calcium, magnesium and potassium. Here are several foods that you?ll want to incorporate into your diet to help reach your essential mineral goals: White Beans Kiwifruit Peaches Nectarines Bananas Kale Red Bell Pepper Sweet Potato Quinoa Avocados h/t: healthy food and sport tips The post 6 Warning Signs of High Blood Pressure and Natural Ways to Treat It! appeared first on DavidWolfe.com.",0

Liberty County resident, 70-year-old Lester Berry, had his power disconnected, disabling his oxygen concentrator. He slowly suffocated to death. Lester Berry?s family found their father several days after Thanksgiving. Berry was found close to the phone. Unfortunately, without power, not only did his oxygen concentrator not work, the phone was not operational either. Berry had chronic pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. Berry?s son stated that the electric company did know of his father?s illness and was also on notice that he occasionally had financial difficulties. It had been the utility?s prior practice to allow Berry up to four months to pay while still providing power. In court documents, the utility suggested Berry did not seek or obtain payment assistance or give them any notice that he needed assistance. The company further suggested Berry?s death was the ?result of an unavoidable accident.? It was usual for Berry to put cash in an envelope and leave it in his mailbox in rural Tarkington. The letter carrier then bought him a money order for his electricity. The month Berry died, he had followed the same routine, but rains got the first envelope wet. Berry brought it back into the house and wrote a note explaining why payment was late and enclosing the money order once again. The note was found near his body. According to the statement of claim filed in this matter, which alleges gross negligence leading to the death of Lester Berry, Sam Houston Electric Cooperative shut his power off because he was a month behind on his bill. He allegedly owed $129.62. The lawsuit is seeking compensation from the courts for over $1 million. ?This case represents such a needless death when the utility company could have extended the shut off period as they had in the past or could have contacted Berry directly to ask for payment. If they had, they would have received an explanation for the late payment. Through a series of unfortunate circumstances, Berry lost his life,? said Brooks Schuelke, an Austin wrongful death lawyer not involved in the case. Court documents seemingly indicated Berry had complied with all the requirements to inform the utility that electricity was needed to sustain his life. Somewhere along the line, something went drastically wrong. ?Wrongful death cases are usually not about money or revenge. They are about sending a message to the defendant that their behavior is not acceptable and that they must do all in their power to not harm another individual in the same situation,? indicated Schuelke. This death could have been prevented but for the action the utility took in cutting off Berry?s power.

It means consuming plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy proteins and fats, and opting for organic, non-GMO foods whenever possible. Let?s explore in more detail why clean eating is so important and look at 10 tips for eating clean that can immediately begin transforming your relationship with food. Cut Back on Added Sugars Americans consume a shocking amount of added sugars every day. On average, adults take in 20-22 teaspoons (3 ounces) of added sugars, which equates to around 355 calories. To help you visualize, 3 ounces is around the size of a deck of cards. Of sugar. Every day. Most added sugar is consumed in the form of soft drinks, the many different kinds of sugar additives in processed foods, and candy, cakes, cookies, pies, and pastries. Sugar adds calories to food while contributing zero nutritional value aside from energy (carbohydrates). A high-sugar diet is linked to: Obesity Metabolic syndrome Insulin resistance that can lead to diabetes Hypoglycemia Heart disease High blood pressure Depression Gout Headache Fatigue It?s important to be mindful of the amount of sugar in the food you are eating as well as the type of sugar. It also helps to eat foods with good amounts of fiber as it slows the body?s absorption of sugar. Limiting consumption of highly processed added sugars is an essential part of clean eating. Distinguishing between natural and added sugars in prepared foods can be confusing for consumers?that?s why some consumer groups are petitioning the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require disclosure of added sugars on nutrition labels. How much is okay? The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends no more than 6 teaspoons (25 grams) of added sugar a day. Ditch Refined Grains Refined grains are less nutritious because they have been stripped of their bran and germ?the most fibrous parts of the plant. As in fruit, the fiber in grains is what slows the absorption of sugars. When blood sugar levels rise too quickly, the result is a spike in insulin, which over time can increase your risk of diabetes. There has been a lot of backlash against the idea that refined grains are less healthy, especially white rice, but we stand firm?whole grains are simply the healthier choice. Choose whole grains like whole wheat, steel cut or rolled oats, brown rice, quinoa, amaranth, flax, and barley. Watch Salt Intake Americans consume far more salt on average than the recommended 1,500 mg maximum per day. Sodium easily ?hides? in packaged foods, sometimes in surprising quantities. Read nutrition labels carefully, and choose wisely. When seasoning homemade food, start with herbs, spices, citrus, and vinegar?and then add salt. You might be surprised at how much salt you add to food while cooking. A high-sodium diet can lead to: High blood pressure Stroke Heart disease Heart failure Choose Minimally-Processed Foods All food has been processed to some extent?even fresh fruits and vegetables must be harvested, cleaned, and (in some cases) polished before they make it to your local market. How do you know a food has been minimally processed? A good rule of thumb is to choose packaged foods and healthy snacks with ingredients you can pronounce. A fruit and nut bar that contains ingredients like dates, cherries, almonds, and walnuts ?in other words, easily identifiable ingredients?is a good choice. Avoid heavily processed foods with a laundry list of ingredients, especially unrecognizable ones. Pick Your Fats Wisely In years past, dietary fat had a bad rap. The low-fat craze led to fats being removed from packaged foods, only to be replaced by sugar (which, as we discussed above, is not a good substitute). Today we know that not all fats are created equal, and that good fat (the polyunsaturated and monounsaturated varieties) are essential for health. Industrial-made fats, including ?trans? fats, should be avoided. Trans fats are a byproduct of hydrogenation, which involves forcing hydrogen molecules into oil to turn it into a solid at room temperature and prevent rancidity. Good for shelf life, bad for your arteries. On food labels you?ll typically see trans fats as ?hydrogenated? or ?partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.? These fats increase your ?bad? LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, which can clog arteries and lead to a host of health problems. What about saturated fats? These are mostly solid at room temperature and are found in foods like red meat, butter, whole milk, and palm oil. Americans generally consume more saturated fats than they should, although whether saturated fats are bad for us is still hotly contested. The latest report released by the World Health Organization has linked processed meats with an increased cancer risk. Your best bet is opting for products that contain ?expeller pressed? or ?cold pressed? vegetable oils, and, better yet, monounsaturated oils from avocados, nuts and nut butters, olives, and high oleic variety sunflower oil. Increase Vegetable Intake Pile those veggies onto your plate! Most of us don?t get enough vegetables every day. The USDA recommends 2-3 cups of vegetables per day for women and 3 cups per day for men, but, go ahead and eat more?we dare you! It?s easier than you think. Dress your sandwich with lettuce and tomato, whip up a veggie-fruit smoothie after a workout, tuck a bag of baby carrots in your bag, and up the amount of veggies in your stir fry. There are a myriad of ways to increase your daily intake of veggies. Cut Back on the Booze ?I cook with wine; sometimes I even add it to the food.? ?W.C. Fields Most of us by now have heard the reports that moderate alcohol consumption may help protect against cardiovascular disease. This is because moderate levels of alcohol increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), our ?good? cholesterol. The problem comes in defining what constitutes moderate drinking?whether it?s one drink per day or three is contested even among alcohol researchers. Here are some good rules to follow: ? Stay within the recommended one drink per day for women or two for men. ? Avoid binge drinking (sorry, folks, imbibing your weekly allotment of adult beverages on a Saturday night isn?t part of a moderate drinking program). ? Just say no to fruity drinks loaded with sugar. Cut Back on Meat and Dairy Most Americans eat far more meat and dairy than is recommended by the USDA. Many of us don?t know what our daily protein needs are, which is part of the problem. The average woman needs just 46 grams of protein a day, while a man needs around 56 grams a day. That?s less than two ounces. A six-ounce steak contains as much protein as a woman needs for an entire day. But that same six-ounce steak comes with increased risks from carcinogens and saturated fat, unlike other sources of protein, such as beans, peas, lentils, nuts, grains, and even some leafy green vegetables. We?ve been told since we were little to drink our milk for strong bones, but many might be surprised to learn that dairy may actually leach calcium from bones, and three-quarters of the world is lactose intolerant. Best to cut back on meat and dairy consumption, and up alternative sources of protein like beans, nuts, and protein-packed veggies and grains. Up Your Fruit Intake It?s a common misconception that we should limit our fruit intake because fruit contains sugar. In our first tip we explained the importance of the fructose-to-fiber ratio. The fiber content in fruit helps the body absorb sugar more slowly. So, go ahead? indulge in daily doses of delicious fruitiness. And don?t forget that all natural snacks like fruit bars made from fruit juices and purees count toward your daily fruit intake. Drink More Water Water is essential for every single one of our bodily functions. It also flushes toxins from the body. Plain water is the best option for staying hydrated, but fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as watermelon, lettuce, and tomatoes, can also help you stay hydrated. Your water needs can vary dramatically depending on the season and your level of physical activity, but at a minimum strive for 8?8?that is, eight 8oz glasses a day. Use this hydration calculator to determine your specific hydration needs. Eating clean is about taking control of your health and understanding how our industrialized food system affects our health and the environment. Here?s to a fresh start and a clean-eating future!

Memories ?taken? by Alzheimer?s could possibly be retrieved Paracetamol ?useless? in treating osteoarthritis pain ""Paracetamol is next to useless at alleviating arthritic pain,"" The Times reports. A comprehensive review of existing data suggests paracetamol should not be used in cases of osteoarthritis as there are far more effective treatments available. Osteoarthritis is now the leading cause of joint pain and stiffness in older people. The review showed that paracetamol , at any dose, had a very low chance of improving pain linked to osteoarthritis (0-4% chance), despite being advised as the painkiller of first choice in current guidance. In contrast, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) class of painkillers, such as diclofenac (150mg per day) and etoricoxib (30, 60 or 90mg per day) were found more likely to improve pain (between 95 and 100% likely) and were the top-ranked painkilling drugs. A potential drawback to NSAIDs is that long-term use can trigger complications such as stomach ulcers , and, in rarer cases, heart failure . If a person is thought to be at risk of stomach ulcers, additional protective medication, such as proton pump inhibitors, may also be prescribed. NICE, the UK?s health watchdog, which issues guidance to doctors, is in the process of updating its guidance on drug management of osteoarthritis. Therefore, it is likely that this latest study will feed into the process. If you have concerns, speak to your doctor. Do not change prescribed medications without consulting your doctor first ? not doing so may damage your health. Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight and regular exercise , can also help relieve symptoms of osteoarthritis. Universities in Switzerland and Canada, and was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and Arco Foundation. Many of the researchers involved in the project reported that they were employed by, or had received grants from, pharmaceutical companies. The study was published medical journal The Lancet. The UK media?s reports were generally accurate, but largely ignored the ""good news"" about NSAIDs and instead focused on debating whether paracetamol should be used for arthritic pain. This is a reasonable line to take due to the large numbers of people who use paracetamol to relieve arthritis pain, both in the UK and around the world. was a meta-analysis of randomised control trials (RCTs) looking at how effective different drugs were to help lower pain linked to osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a condition that causes the joints to become painful and stiff. It is the most common type of arthritis in the UK. There is no cure for osteoarthritis, but it can be effectively managed. The main treatments for osteoarthritis include lifestyle measures ? such as maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly ? medication to relieve your pain (including paracetamol), and supportive therapies to help make everyday activities easier. The analysis found 74 decent sized RCTs (with over 100 people) comparing different NSAIDS or paracetamol with a placebo to improve osteoarthritic pain. How well the drugs improved joint movement was also assessed. Included NSAIDs that are available in the UK were: ibuprofen celecoxib (commonly called a COX 2 inhibitor) etoricoxib (commonly called a COX 2 inhibitor) The analysis also included rofecoxib and lumiracoxib ? both of which have been withdrawn from the UK market due to safety concerns. In total, 58,556 people were included in the analysis. Average (median) follow up was 12 weeks, with a large range, from one week to one year. The researchers used a statistical technique called network meta-analysis. This allows direct and indirect comparisons of drugs. For example, if one study compared paracetamol with a placebo, and a second compared an NSAID with placebo in similar conditions, this technique allows you to estimate the probability that paracetamol works better than the NSAID. Including these indirect comparisons is useful, but not as accurate as trials directly comparing one drug with another, sometimes called ""head-to-head"" trials. This review included both direct and indirect comparisons. The final output was a rank of all the NSAIDs, paracetamol and placebo, and an estimate of their ability to achieve a minimum, clinically important, difference in pain. The minimum difference was defined at a set point reduction (-0.37 standard deviations) within the overall spread of pain reductions for each trial. Etoricoxib (60mg or 90mg) and diclofenac (150mg per day, the maximum dose) were very likely to improve pain (between 95 and 100% likely) and were the top-ranked NSAIDS. The withdrawn drug rofecoxib was also similarly ranked. The bottom of the ranking table was filled with different doses of paracetamol. For example, the highest-ranked paracetamol dose (3g per day) was linked to only a 21% chance of helping pain to a useful level. Doses less than 2g had only a 4% chance of helping pain, ranking second to last, behind Naproxen 750mg. concluded: ""On the basis of the available data, we see no role for single-agent paracetamol for the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis irrespective of dose."" They added: ""We provide sound evidence that diclofenac 150mg/day is the most effective NSAID available at present, in terms of improving both pain and function. Nevertheless, in view of the safety profile of these drugs, physicians need to consider our results together with all known safety information when selecting the preparation and dose for individual patients."" Conclusion This Swiss study reviewed drugs commonly used and recommended to help pain associated with osteoarthritis. Through indirect comparison, it identified those likely to be most effective (diclofenac 150 mg/day) and those that are pretty likely to be useless (paracetamol any dose). The study looked at a large number of good-sized RCTs ? all with more than 100 people ? and covered a useful range of NSAIDS. The quality of the RCTs was also assessed and was generally not highly biased, although variable. However, the review included many indirect comparisons of the drugs, which is less accurate and reliable than direct comparisons. But without more direct comparisons available, this is probably the best we have to go on for now. The main implication from the study authors? point of view was clear: paracetamol has no place in the pain management of osteoarthritis on its own. This finding jars with the UK?s current national guidance that advocates using paracetamol as a first-choice painkiller, alongside other osteoarthritis management. The fact paracetamol might not be useful in the pain management of osteoarthritis does appear to be recognised by NICE ? the watchdog that issues guidance on medicines ? although the current guidance, based on 2008 recommendations, advocates its use. For example, NICE reports that it is in the process of updating the guidance and hints that paracetamol may be less effective than thought in 2008. NICE makes a point of saying on its website that an evidence review on the effectiveness of paracetamol as part of a consultation exercise showed, ""reduced effectiveness of paracetamol in the management of osteoarthritis compared with what was previously thought."" The current guideline on pain management in osteoarthritis is due to be updated in September 2016. In the meantime, if you have concerns about taking paracetamol for pain linked to osteoarthritis, consult your doctor before changing your medications. It is also important not to overlook the benefits that lifestyle changes, such as achieving a healthy weight and becoming more active, can bring.

Pharmacology isn?t exactly everyone?s favorite subject. Remember all the nerve wracking exams that made you feel clueless about the world, the brain draining drug studies that made you feel dizzy, the crazy discussions that bled you dry and all the ?I-don?t-even-know-how-to-pronounce-this? drugs that you had to memorize? Yup, again, not everyone?s favorite subject. But then, as nurses who care for patients, it is inescapable as it is considered as an important part of the profession. So, how do we deal with this? How can we memorize/remember all those drugs a bit more easily? Below are some mnemonics and tips that might be of help for us nurses, in our attempt to survive Pharma: Lidocaine Toxicity: ?SAMS? S: Slurred speech A: Altered central nervous system M: Muscle twitching S: Seizures Medication Administration Checklist: ?TRAMP? T: Time Check the order for when it would be given and when was the last time it was given. R: Route Check the order if it?s through oral, IV, SQ, IM, or etc. A: Amount Check the medication sheet and the doctor?s order before medicating. Be aware of the difference of an adult and a pediatric dose. M: Medication Check and verify if it?s the right name and form. Beware of look-alike and sound-alike medication names. P: Patient Ask the name of the client and check his/her ID band before giving the medication. Even if you know that patient?s name, you still need to ask just to verify. Serious Complications of Oral Birth Control Pills: ?SEA CASH? S: Severe leg pain E: Eye problems A: Abdominal pain C: Chest pain A: Acne S: Swelling of ankles and feet H: Headaches which are severe Emergency Drugs to ?LEAN? on L: Lidocaine ACTION: Suppresses automaticity of ventricular cells, decreasing diastolic depolarization and increasing ventricular fibrillation threshold. Produces local anesthesia by reducing sodium permeability of sensory nerves, which blocks impulse generation and conduction. USES: Ventricular arrhythmias, topical/local anesthetic E: Epinephrine ACTION: Stimulates alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, causing relaxation of cardiac and bronchial smooth muscle and dilation of skeletal muscles. USES: Bronchodilation; anaphylaxis; hypersensitivity reaction; Acute asthma attack; Chronic simple glaucoma A: Atropine Sulfate ACTION: Inhibits acetylcholine at parasympathetic neuroeffector junction of smooth muscle and cardiac muscle, blocking sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes to increase impulse conduction and raise heart rate. USES: Decreases respiratory secretions, treats sinus bradycardia, reverses effects of anticholinesterase medication N: Narcan ACTION: Naloxone is used to treat an opioid emergency such as an overdose or a possible overdose of a narcotic medicine. USES: Opioid-induced toxicity; opioid-induced respiratory depression; used in neonates to counteract or treat effects from narcotics given to mother during labor Drugs for Bradycardia & Hypotension: ?IDEA? I: Isoproterenol Acts on beta2-adrenergic receptors, causing relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle; acts on beta1-adrenergic receptors in heart, causing positive inotropic and chronotropic effects and increasing cardiac output. Also lowers peripheral vascular resistance in skeletal muscle and inhibits antigen-induced histamine release. D: Dopamine Causes norepinephrine release (mainly on dopaminergic receptors), leading to vasodilation of renal and mesenteric arteries. Also exerts inotropic effects on heart, which increases the heart rate, blood flow, myocardial contractility, and stroke volume. E: Epinephrine Stimulates alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, causing relaxation of cardiac and bronchial smooth muscle and dilation of skeletal muscles. Also decreases aqueous humor production, increases aqueous outflow, and dilates pupils by contracting dilator muscle. A: Atropine Sulfate Acts on beta2-adrenergic receptors, causing relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle; acts on beta1-adrenergic receptors in heart, causing positive inotropic and chronotropic effects and increasing cardiac output. Also lowers peripheral vascular resistance in skeletal muscle and inhibits antigen-induced histamine release. Thiazides Indications: ?CHIC? C: Congestive Heart Failure H: Hypertension I: Insipidus C: Calcium calculi Morphine Side Effects: ?MORPHINE? M: Myosis O: Out of it (sedation) R: Respiratory depression P: Pneumonia (aspiration) H: Hypotension I: Infrequency (constipation, urinary retention) N: Nausea E: Emesis Atrial Arrhythmias: ?ABCDE? A: Anticoagulants To prevent embolization. B: Beta blockers To block the effects of certain hormones on the heart to slow the heart rate. C: Calcium Channel Blockers Help slow the heart rate by blocking the number of electrical impulses that pass through the AV node into the lower heart chambers (ventricles). D: Digoxin Digoxin helps slow the heart rate by blocking the number of electrical impulses that pass through the AV node into the lower heart chambers (ventricles). E: Electrocardioversion A procedure in which electric currents are used to reset the heart?s rhythm back to regular pattern.

These new dietary guidelines for the Dutch are based on 29 systematic reviews of English language meta-analyses in PubMed summarizing randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies on nutrients, foods and food patterns and the risk of 10 major chronic diseases: coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, diabetes, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia and depression. The committee also selected three causal risk factors for cardiovascular diseases or diabetes: systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and body weight. Findings were categorized as strong or weak evidence, inconsistent effects, too little evidence or effect unlikely for experimental and observational data separately. Next, the committee selected only findings with a strong level of evidence for deriving the guidelines. Convincing evidence was based on strong evidence from the experimental data either or not in combination with strong evidence from prospective cohort studies. Plausible evidence was based on strong evidence from prospective cohort studies only. A general guideline to eat a more plant food-based dietary pattern and limit consumption of animal-based food and 15 specific guidelines have been formulated. There are 10 new guidelines on legumes, nuts, meat, dairy produce, cereal products, fats and oils, tea, coffee and sugar-containing beverages. Three guidelines on vegetables, fruits, fish and alcoholic beverages have been sharpened, and the 2006 guideline on salt stayed the same. A separate guideline has been formulated on nutrient supplements. We concluded that completely food-based dietary guidelines can be derived in a systematic and transparent way.",0

Return to Tomorrow was published in 1954, towards the tail end of Hubbard's ""Golden Age pulp writer"" period but before his ""criminal cult leader"" period began in earnest. It actually debuted four years earlier as To the Stars, a two-part story in the monthly Astounding Science Fiction, which is why the only Wikipedia page for ""Return to Tomorrow"" refers to a Star Trek episode. And I think this means that the book cover is lying to me when it claims this story is ""An ACE BOOK Original Novel, Never Before Published."" Not even an asterisk explaining ""as a complete story"" to cover their asses. As you can see from that cover, this here's a vintage sci-fi story. We've got classic rocket ships landed on their tail ends, we've got sleek weapons that can only be ray guns, and we've got useless fins on the helmets of the ""space suits,"" which I refer to with sarcastic quotation marks because the things don't even have gloves. At least put on some mittens, dearie, space is cold. Our story hook on the back cover is ""Shanghaied Into Eternity"" - our protagonist Alan Corday is doomed to be captured by a Captain Jocelyn to crew a spaceship, since ""not even wealth and women were sufficient to fill his crew vacancies."" That's because of the terrible price you pay for sailing between worlds, which will be elaborated on later. So we're due for a mutiny, swashbuckling pirates, and ""the acrid fumes of a war of annihilation"" as Mr. Corday tries to get home. Also, I'm tickled that ""women"" is listed as a lure to entice sailors. ""You there, strapping young lad! Would you like to leave your old life behind and sign on for months of labor inside a cold steel shell wrapped in the colder void of space, possibly to never see your home world again?"" ""No."" ""You might get laid."" ""I've reconsidered."" But what is this fearsome price that all star sailors must pay? Perhaps the prologue will elaborate. Space is deep, Man is small, and Time is his relentless enemy. Do we have to be so disparaging? Can't we say that Man is big, but Space is just bigger? In an ancient and forgotten age, The early 20th century. he first discovered the barricade. Before space travel first began he knew the barricade was there. It was an equation. Without the equation, the basic equation of mass and time, Man could not have progressed beyond barbaric fire. Er... I think we had at least made it to the Medieval Age, maybe even the Industrial Era, before busting out this particular physics equation. But he did progress Oh, well, objection withdrawn then. I mean, if you are going to immediately contradict yourself... and he used fission and his mechanicians Did you mean ""machinations?"" became mighty and his hopes large. But the terms of his salvation were the terms of his imprisonment as well. AS MASS APPROACHES INFINITY, TIME APPROACHES ZERO. Ah, I see. As Man sits on the couch and eats microwave dinners, he gains weight exponentially, but his time runs out and he dies of heart failure. The narrator credits this equation to Lortentz and ""Fitzgerald"" and especially a ""theoretical philosopher"" named Einstein. With the power of this equation that Man fellow was able to colonize the Solar System, yet at the same time it ""almost denied to him the stars."" And by ""almost"" I mean ""didn't."" And yet, despite the difficulty derived by these great men and confirmed first by nuclear physicists and then by actual use, there were still those who accepted and yet defied the law, a small cohort of ships and men who, throughout the ages have kept the routes alive. The outcasts and pariahs of extra-atmosphere travel, the cursed and shunned by Man, they course their lonely ways, far-bound but prisoners too, shackled fast by Time. Knowing well their waiting fate, who would volunteer to become part of that thin group? Er, the outcasts and pariahs, those cursed and shunned by- But amongst the societies of man there are always those who are outcasts from character or force of circumstance, and there are adventurers who will not heed equations. And so the stars were reached and partially explored despite the fact of those who made the runs. This narrator is going to keep answering his own questions by repeating information he gave before asking them. Also, my hunch is that's supposed to be ""despite the fate of those who made the runs."" But let's get down to the brass tacks, whatever those are. These outcasts take what's called ""the long passage"" to places like Alpha Centauri, which a spaceship can reach in six weeks. Sometimes they're earnest adventurers, sometimes they're criminals and fugitives trying to evade capture. At any rate, if they ever get back to their port of origin, they'll find it irrevocably changed, because while it's a six-week voyage for them, many years will have passed planetside. This can be a bit inconvenient. He who is gone for a century cannot well return. He knows too little. His people are dead. He has no place and he does not fit. And what may have begun as an adventure for a crew invariably ended in the same way - another passage out while behind them further age accumulated while the crew stayed young. The only fraternity was within the ship. The only hope was that some day someone might discover another equation, a solution to the barricade: AS MASS APPROACHES THE SPEED OF LIGHT, TIME APPROACHES ZERO. The outcasts of the long passage, those that stayed alive, never ceased to hope. See, this is a story about time dilation. And true to form, the author is muddling it up. As I've said before, my career in hard science was cut short by some bad experiences in high school, so I'm not the most qualified person to discuss this topic. But as far as I've been able to piece together, the idea goes like this - the faster you're moving compared to another frame of reference, the less time seems to pass for you by their standards. On your spaceship zipping around at Warp Whatever, you wouldn't notice anything weird, but if you went back to Earth, you'd find that your ship's clocks marked less time on your voyage than what your departure and return times on Earth would indicate. Thus, flying around at high speeds is a form of one-way, only-forward time travel. As for where mass enters his equation, err... I think Hubbard's latched on to the notion of ""relativistic mass,"" but I don't think this actually means you get bigger or anything as you approach lightspeed. And the ""time approaches zero"" bit is also perplexing, since it would imply that what, as you move fast you get bigger and then stop moving at all? It's probably better to ignore this cruel equation altogether and just keep in mind that weeks aboard a spaceship can equal years for your family back home. Except it sounds like this story is going to be about trying to find a breakthrough new equation. This could be problematic, a story based on solving a misunderstanding of advanced physics.",0

Well there can be many reasons for symptoms you mention in query , but in your case the symptoms are probably due to cardiac problem like angina or heart failure .I would suggest you to consult cardiologist without any delay . Doctor may order ECG, TMT along with complete blood profile and checking vitals . Doctor may prescribe isosorbide nitrate , aspirin , betablockers , frusamide and sedatives . Doctor may also order angiography . For now stay calm , take proper rest and do not exert your body . As your doctor already ruled out cardiac problem your should refer you to gastroenterologist for acid reflux disease or neurologist for nerve dysfunction . For now eat light and non spicy specially at night , take antacid after every meal . Hope your concern has been resolved. Get Well Soon. Best Wishes, Dr. Harry Maheshwari",0

January 1, 1953) was an American singer-songwriter and musician. Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century, Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that would place in the Top 10 of the Billboard Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one (three posthumously). Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams moved to Georgiana, where he met Rufus Payne, a black street performer who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams' later musical style, along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. During this time, Williams informally changed his name to Hank, believing it to be a better name for country music. He moved to Montgomery and his music career began there in 1937, when WSFA radio station producers hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed as backup the Drifting Cowboys band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements and was dismissed by WSFA due to his alcoholism. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who managed him for nearly a decade. After recording ""Never Again"" and ""Honky Tonkin'"" with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1948 he released ""Move It on Over"", which became a hit, and also joined the Louisiana Hayride radio program. One year later, he released a cover of ""Lovesick Blues"", which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were ""Your Cheatin' Heart"", ""Hey, Good Lookin'"", and ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"". Several years of back pain, alcoholism, and prescription drug abuse severely damaged Williams' health; he divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry, which cited unreliability and frequent intoxication. Williams died in the early morning hours of January 1, 1953, at the age of 29, from heart failure exacerbated by pills and alcohol. Despite his short life, Williams has had a major influence on 20th century popular music, especially country music. The songs he wrote and recorded have been covered by numerous artists, and have been hits in various genres. He has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame, such as the Country Music Hall of Fame (1961), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1970), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1987).",0

IMO it is a dangerous drug. Usually a sulfonylurea drug (glyburide, glimepiride, or glipizide) is given if Metformin alone won't sufficiently lower your blood glucose. IMO if Metformin and a sulfonylurea won't do the trick, than you are better off on insulin than taking a dangerous drug. In my estimation, most of the newer drugs have dangerous side effects.

""In 2007 I went into the hospital to have gallbladder surgery. The Doctors found out that I had an enlarged heart, and they sent me to Des Moines, Iowa to the Iowa Methodist Hospital to have the surgery. At that time the Heart Doctor said I could have a stroke on the operating table, because my heart function was only at 10% at that time. At that time they found that I had 3 heart values leaking , AFIB. The Doctors thought I might have had a heart attack at one point of time. In 2009 my blood workup showed that I had Diabetes. I am on 7 medicines for my heart and a controlled diet for my diabetes. In January of 2014 I saw a post about Skinny Fiber. I talked to my cardiologist and diabetic doctors, I told the doctors them that skinny fiber had 3 plant ingredients and digestive enzymes - Glucomannan, Caralluma and Chade Burge. Both Doctors were impressed with it and gave me the go ahead to use it. I have more energy, feel better, my knees don't hurt as much as what they did when I was heavy. I get out of bed with more energy to get ready for work, my attitude is better and I feel like I am a lot happier then what I used to be. I seem that I can do so much more at work and at home. I can't wait until I can get outdoor to plant my veggie garden, weed my flower gardens and plant some new kinds of flowers. In July of 2014 I went to Des Moines for my annual Heart checkup and the Doctor did all the stress tests, EKG, and Ultra-Sounds of my heart and I am now at 65% heart function compared to the 10% that I was. The Doctor said I had a good recovery from what I had started out before surgery. I can't wait to see the Doctors in July this year and see what they have to say about my heart. As of today I have lost 135 pounds and around 85 inches overall. I am so happy that I found Skinny Fiber! I became a distributor of Skinny Fiber a year ago, and I enjoy the fact that I am trying to help other people try to become healthy and feel better about themselves. The first picture in the lavender shirt was when I was the heaviest in 1997, the second one is when I first started Skinny Fiber in March of 2014, and the picture of me in the stripped sweater was as of Tuesday, March 17,2015. Finding Skinny Fiber was the best thing that happened to me!! I am proud to say that it has helped me so much. I have so much to be thankful for!!"" START YOUR JOURNEY TODAY.

I'm 25, he was only 61. Recently retired, just had his birthday a week prior, no pre-existing conditions, no problems. He never drank and he's never touched a smoke in his life. He wasn't obese, and he was active for a man of his age - he just loved his coffee and chocolate, as we all do. But he just dropped and that was it. Just makes you think about what really matters the most in life. All that matters to me right now is my family, and making sure Mum is given the strength and support that she needs. Usually I run to JB a few times a week and walk away with Blu-rays, but right now I'm questioning my need for such a big collection. I just know that Mum will never be the same again, and it hurts beyond all comprehension. Things change in an instant. All I can say - as cliched as it sounds - is that everyone needs to cherish every second they have with their parents. I'm telling all my mates to call their parents and just tell them they love them. I have no idea when I last told the old man I loved him, and though I hope he knew it in his heart, I just wish I had the chance to tell him how much I appreciate him. Sadness tinged with remorse and regret. I'm sorry for your loss too mate, you're not alone. On the 18th of March this year, one day after my 14th birthday, my grandma had a fall. My family were going to go out for dinner that night to celebrate my birthday, although at the last minute, we decided not to. Around 8:30 pm, Grandma passed away. My dad was at the hospital the time she died, and he was with her when she passed. We had the funeral the week after on the Thursday, and my dad was very depressed throughout the week. My dad had lost his younger brother more than 30 years ago, and also lost his dad 15 years ago, before I was born. Throughout this time, I was also thinking about what I should care about the most in my life. At school, I've been doing my homework in time, so I can spend more time with my family in my life. I haven't been watching many blu-rays recently, because I know I have something better to do. And I do those things. I just want people to know who I am, so when I am gone, I have a person or two who remembered me.",0

Back in early June, I began having pain in the back of my right calf. I assumed I had just pulled a muscle and didn't think twice about it. On June 15th, I was walking down some stairs and all of the sudden, I felt such a pain that I saw stars and thought the person behind me kicked me in the calf, only to turn around and see that nobody was behind me. All of a sudden, I could barely walk. It was excruciating. I didn't do anything that I know of to injure it. I went to the ER that night and they checked to make sure it was not a DVT blood clot and said it was probably just a muscle or ligament tear/injury. The pain subsided within a few days but I then noticed that the side of my foot was all purple and bruised, I'm assuming blood drained downwards from the calf injury. Now, a month a half later, that foot and ankle are always swollen, almost twice the size of my other foot. I tend to panic about health related issues (knowing that congestive heart failure causes swollen ankles and feet) but since it's on the same side as the calf injury was, I'm wondering if that could cause this constant swelling (even though my calf doesn't hurt anymore). Any input is appreciated. Thanks!!",1

As we have proved, Cancer is curable, whereas cardiomyopathy is with us for ever. I would actually prefer the cancer. I am very happy with my life at the moment, but would love to wake up one morning and find that there was a drug that could give me that magic fix. Unfortunately although I have been offered the most up to date and innovative treatment out there, I am still in Heart Failure and probably will be for the rest of my life. You do come to terms with it, but you do have to live with it daily for the rest of your life. Ozchrissy, this is my story. I was diagnosed at age 23 with stage 4 acute lymphoblastic lymphoma. I had a 30% survival chance and it went up to 60% with a bone marrow transplant. My son was born a few weeks early by emergency c-section so I could start chemo immediately. I became depressed (postpartum and everything else going on). I was in intensive care multiple times. When the chemo did it's trick and I hit remission, I went for the transplant. Spent 35 days inpatient in another hospital in Chicago, Illinois. Had more chemo that took me to the brink of death before they could infuse the bone marrow. Once I finally was able to go home, it took several months before I had enough strength to take care of my newborn (remember, I just had a baby). We had hired help and family members living with us to help at night. We own a construction company and no money coming in if my husband didn't work all day. I couldn't go out in public for a year- if I had to go to the grocery store, I had to wear a mask. I couldn't drive for over 6 months. It took a year for my hair to start growing back and I have some permanent alopecia. I had many side effects from the chemo drugs. I had a little liver trouble after the transplant but that cleared up. They had to use the ""big guns"" and those gave pretty big side effects. I won't go into the gory details but it was very unpleasant, painful and scary at times. Ironically, I never actually thought I would die- I just wished I would. The only thing that kept me going was that little boy I had to get back to. The worst fear for me was me dying and having my mother-in-law take care of him, lol! Now, for those of you who may have just read this, keep in mind that was 23 years ago and the treatment is significantly different now. If you know someone who has to have a bone marrow transplant, it will not be like what you just read- thankfully. For me, I actually see CHF as livable. Changed my diet and my expectations of what I can accomplish and just enjoy life for however long I can. I am not afraid of dying, but don't worry, I am not suicidal either. I just look at it very differently now. My opinion is there are worse things than death. Aren't you sorry you asked, Ozchrissy?! I really am a very happy, calm, easy going person who just enjoys the simple things in life. And I'm happy that the sun is shining today here.",1
BLOG,leaderfitness.blogspot.com,http://leaderfitness.blogspot.com/2016/07/pain-doctor-houston-professional.html,7/25/2016,21:22:00,,,"By Kevin Barnes At some point in your life, you have experienced pain in your body. Pain is not a disease on its own, but it is a signal that your body has a medical condition that needs treatment. It is common for one to make an off-counter purchase of drugs that relieve pain, but it is advisable to visit a doctor for an examination. Instead of overlooking pains, you can consult a pain doctor Houston professional for advice, assessment, and treatment. There are several pains that you should not ignore as this article discusses. One of the pains that you should not overlook is severe morning headache. A mild headache can go unnoticed, but a severe headache denotes an acute health issue such as a brain tumor. The condition is rare. Therefore, you should not think of a brain tumor every time your head hurts in the morning. The incidence of a primary brain tumor is usually below one percent. At times, you may experience a stomach irritation that occurs between the navel and the breastplate. It is usually in the form of a burning sensation, and it indicates several medical conditions including ulcers. This type of pain has other complimentary signs such as blood in the stool and getting a relief each time you take a meal. Having a painful discomfort and a swell on one leg is a probable indication of a blood clot. Sometimes when one travels on plane or car for a long time, the blood tends to clot in the legs. The same happens if one rests for so long or after having a recent surgery. Swelling in both legs denotes a more complex condition such as a congestive heart failure. It shows that you should never ignore a swelling that occurs on legs, but you should see a specialist. A painful irritation in the back at night is the other health issue to watch. The irritation is usually so severe that it wakes you up. While it is possible to rule out wearing and tearing of the body as the main cause of the pain, having a history of cancer or fever for a person having such back pains necessitates a visit to a specialist. There is a medical condition that results in the hardening of the arteries, and one of the main signs is having pain that penetrates on your back. You should never ignore this kind of a discomfort since it might result in a heart problem. You had better prevent extensive complications by taking the ideal measures on a timely manner. One of the early indicators of diabetes is having a feeling of pins and needles in the feet. A lot of people live with diabetes since they tend to ignore the feeling. What follows after the feeling is numbness of the feet. Making a prompt visit to a specialist after having the pins and needles in the feet enables one to manage diabetes at its early stages. Having the discussed signs does not necessarily mean that you have the medical conditions that are associated with them. However, it is only a doctor who can confirm the nature of the resultant medical conditions that the pains indicate. Therefore, you should make a visit to a specialist to have the pains examined.

A video of Albert Jeffries IV finding out this week that a heart was available for transplant was posted to a Facebook page by his mother, and his stunned reaction to the good news has helped the post go viral. Albert was born with dilated cardiomyopathy, a heart disease that causes the heart's main pumping chamber, the left ventricle, to be enlarged and weakened, decreasing its ability to pump blood. ?He almost passed out,? his mother, Tina Turner, told ABC News Friday about the moment Albert first found out late Wednesday of the organ's availability. ?He could not believe the news.? ?What?s going on? What?s going on?? he says in the video that his doctor filmed of the moment his mother told him he had a heart available. ?They got my heart? They got my heart?? Turner, a nurse at UNC Hospital, where her son was staying, had found out earlier in the day that the hospital finally had a heart transplant available for her son. She was at the nail salon, as per her son?s request to give him some space, when she got a call from her son telling her the nurses weren?t giving him food. She called to figure out what was going on and the nurses told her they stopped Albert from eating because he was prepping for heart surgery. ?When she said 'he?s prepping,' I lost it. I knew he had a heart,? Turner said. A woman at the nail salon sitting next to her filmed her reaction to the phone call. ?I was screaming and crying. People who saw me were screaming and crying,? she said. ?I was so overwhelmed with emotions.? In that moment, all the doctor?s appointments, the sleepless nights and the holidays spent in the hospital meant nothing to Turner, because they were not going to ?stop until he got that heart.? At several times in Albert?s life, it appeared that the odds were against him -- going into ICU when he was 6 and 10, and going into heart failure around Christmas in 2014 -- but Turner described how his positivity helped him fight on. ?I always tell my kids not to have fear, to be strong,? she said. ?This kid is the one who kept me strong.? During this last lengthy span he was in the hospital, for 101 days and counting, he contracted double pneumonia and his kidneys started failing, but he was able to persevere, Turner said. ?All these years he took the disease like a champ,? she said. Before the surgery on Wednesday night, Albert listened to his heart beating one last time. He underwent surgery late Wednesday night into early Thursday morning. The next morning his mother recorded him waking up and saying, ?I feel like a new person.? Albert is on the road to recovery and ?his heart is fully working now,? Turner said. He should be out of the hospital in the next couple of weeks, she added. She said Albert is looking forward to going back to school, and finally getting the chance to run and play sports that he was never able to do before. ?He is my hero,? she said.

One of the deadliest killers within the world these days it's coronary heart illness. But all Congestive coronary heart failure, a condition discovered secondary to several main cardiac diseases, possesses its personal high mortality rate. Fifty percent of those diagnosed with congestive coronary heart failure will die inside the five following years. The precise mechanism from the illness is coronary hard to comprehend and scientists are struggling to discover a remedy. A coronary heart attack can trigger the center to turn out to be nonfunctional and congestive coronary heart failure can trigger the tissue of the center to die. Whatever the trigger, the center is subsequently unable to pump blood adequately throughout the physique, resulting within the blood pooling within the organs and fluid building up in and across the lungs as sodium is unable to become correctly excreted, causing the dyspnea that's the classic symptom of congestive coronary heart failure. The possibility of repairing the harm tissue in the center and also the therapy from the illness is targeted by medical study. Present study is underway to test new medicines that would help in vasodilation, too as a calcium inhibitor that would not outcome within the higher incidence of cardiac arrhythmia seen with the medicines presently around the market. Within the age of normal medicine, the power from the mind has been invoked in medical trials to use meditation and relaxation strategies to combat the tension around the coronary heart, they could be the breaking point for sufferers with coronary heart failure. The body's blood pressure could be negatively effected by tension, causing a currently weakened muscle to become forced to work harder which in turn places an undue quantity of pressure on this precious organ. The theory lies within the belief that by learning to maintain a low level of mental tension the center will most likely be much less stressed and as a result much less likely to fail totally, and within the end the patient could be given a much better prognosis. Alongside the return to normal, holistic techniques of therapy is an incredible advancement in medical technology that was not obtainable twenty or thirty years ago. Attempts are becoming made to reverse the effects of congestive coronary heart illness, scientists are now claiming to have identified a set of altered genes that will make an individual much more disposed to suffer from this kind of coronary heart illness. In addition, medicines to tamp down around the genes' activities, for example beta blockers and alpha-2 agonists are currently obtainable and becoming utilized in therapy programs. There are lots of kinds of study and one of these is stem cell study, this uses the bodies pluripotent progenitors which help within the repair from the harm to coronary heart tissue. Medical trials showed that sufferers suffering from congestive coronary heart failure responded extremely favorably to an injection of their personal stem tissue into the center, even though the precise means by which this causes improvement is as yet unknown. Stem tissue can assist facilitate the growth of new vessels in the center, it's also believed they stimulate and repair the center by extracting the bodies personal healing tissue. Present study that's becoming explored is transplanting embryonic stem tissue into a patient's physique it's believed that they are able to grow healthy tissues, this is in some circles questionable as it entails the destruction from the embryo. Embryo stem tissue are utilized as an adequate number of new tissue that meet the wants from the sufferers can't be produced by adults. A person's physique can't reproduce dead tissue in the center and this makes coronary heart failure incredibly dangerous; it's hoped that researchers will one day discover a remedy with all of the modern health-related advancements which are becoming found each and every day.

Discoveries in stem cell science over the past decade are finally starting to reach the clinic. Current clinical trials are evaluating stem cell therapies for conditions ranging from eye disease to AIDS. These trials are going on in the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan and elsewhere. But Australia is lagging behind. While we remain fairly competitive in fundamental research, we are slow to translate our discoveries into new therapies. This concern was expressed in the Australian Academy of Science report, released today, called The Stem Cell Revolution: Lessons and Imperatives for Australia. It contains a series of recommendations from young research leaders in the field on how Australian science policy can help fast-track stem cell research here. Researchers are often asked by patients or their relatives when stem cell treatments will be available for certain medical conditions. Ten years ago, the answer would have been that there are no new treatments yet, but we are working to develop them. Today, we are forced to answer that clinical trials of cell therapies for particular conditions are going on, but not in Australia. We have an obligation to ensure that Australian patients, their families, carers and physicians are not left behind in the stem cell revolution. Stem cell therapy Human embryonic stem cells, which can become cells in any tissue of the body, were first discovered in 1998. Today, embryonic stem cell treatment trials are underway for macular degeneration (a common form of blindness), spinal cord injury, juvenile diabetes and heart failure. Embryonic stem cell therapies are being trialled for macular degeneration, a common form of blindness. Embryonic stem cell therapies are being trialled for macular degeneration, a common form of blindness. Then there are the induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that Japanese scientist Shinya Yamanaka discovered, which won him the Nobel Prize in 2012. iPS cells are made from adult tissues and have many of the defining properties of embryonic stem cells. They can be made from skin or blood cells of any person. After Yamanaka?s discovery, Japan?s cell therapy regulatory framework was modified to fast-track products from these new stem cells into the clinic. As a consequence, therapies using induced iPS cells, which enable close tissue matching of stem cell transplants to patients to prevent graft rejection, are now in clinical trials there, only ten years after their discovery. More trials will begin very soon. For instance, years of research on midbrain dopaminergic neurons, the cells lost in Parkinson?s disease, has paved the way for upcoming trials of stem cells replacing these lost neurons. There are also a large number of human trials in progress using mesenchymal stem cells, which are extracted from bone marrow, fat or other tissues. Capable of modulating the immune system and inflammatory response, these stem cells have the potential ability to treat arthritis, autoimmune disorders, graft versus host disease in bone marrow transplant patients, and a number of other conditions. Neural stem cells derived from either foetal or adult brain tissue are also undergoing testing in humans, for rare inherited disorders of the brain or more common conditions including spinal cord injury. It?s unlikely these early stage trials will produce cures for any of these conditions. Indeed they might pose as many questions as they answer. But it is essential and significant that these trials are moving forward, because the lessons we learn from them will guide us towards the design of the next generation of cellular therapeutics. Gene therapy and drug discovery Today, genetic modification of stem cells with precision can provide cell therapies that can permanently correct serious genetic disorders. Human embryonic stem cells can become cells in tissue in any part of the body. For years, progress in gene therapy was almost totally blocked by safety concerns around the relatively crude technologies for introducing genetic alterations into patient cells. But technological advances have enabled precise correction of genetic defects within a cell. This avoids off-target modifications that can cause cancers and other serious toxicities. New treatments using combined gene and cell therapy are undergoing trials now. The California Institute of Regenerative Medicinelists about ten new human studies, including in AIDS, blood diseases and cancer. Then there is a third stream of stem cell research that, although perhaps less visible to the general public, has implications well beyond cell therapy. This is the ability to derive pluripotent stem cells from patients with genetic predisposition to disease, or to introduce disease mutations into stem cells via gene editing. We can then use these disease-specific stem cell lines to generate the cell types affected in a particular disorder to study what goes wrong with them in the lab. For instance, we can study how a gene that causes epilepsy affects the electrical properties of human nerve cells. Once we develop these cell culture models, we can use them to screen candidate drugs to correct the deficits in the affected cells. This technology will enable us to reduce dependence on animal models, which don?t always replicate human diseases, and will reduce the risk of testing drugs on living human subjects. These advances have the potential to speed the discovery of new medicines, to rapidly eliminate candidate drugs that might cause toxicity in the clinic, and to save millions from the costs of drug development. To ensure Australian patients have timely access to new stem cell therapies for intractable diseases, we must maintain our excellence in fundamental stem cell research. But we also need to develop new and better mechanisms to support collaboration between academia, the private sector and philanthropists with the aim of translating discoveries into cures. https://theconversation.com/stem-cell-therapies-are-advancing-but-will-australian-patients-be-left-behind-56504",0

I got even more hell because I got to leave at least once a week without earning the privilege because I had to get allergy shots. (Imagine a bunch of adults treating a sick, bookish, YOUNG autistic kid like she thinks she's Shannen Doherty in Heathers, and you've got a pretty good idea of the situation.) For the record, my actual diagnoses are autism spectrum disorder/Asperger's syndrome, which really didn't get diagnosed in girls at that time, and bipolar II either compounded with or with traits of major depressive disorder; as well as fibromyalgia, some pretty serious autoimmune problems (my symptoms best fit systemic lupus erythematosus), and a Rare Orphan genetic disorder called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which results in systemic collagen abnormalities and which is related to osteogenesis imperfecta (what the villain in Unbreakable had). What I was diagnosed with was schizophrenia, and good insurance. The first shrink even committed out and out insurance fraud. Both shrinks are dead now, thank fuck. I still run some risk of heart failure from one of the meds I was on, and another left me intolerant to multiple drug classes, including multiple common types of anesthesia. (Ask me what it's like to undergo spinal biopsies and injections wide awake because the OR's don't have the one sedative you can take.)",1

Unfortunately, I have allowed a few labels to be placed upon me by the medical profession to explain the aftermath of very traumatic medical experience in my life. So let me first recap and go back a few years, and bring you all up to speed. I was admitted to the hospital with Graves Dysease (hyperthyroidism) in 2002. During my admittance I was informed that I was in the final stages and at the point where my internal organs were beginning to shut down (as was told by the admittance nurse in the hospital). I actually collapsed on my way into the hospital and was put in a wheel chair as I answered the necessary questions. I have little recollection of much as time blurred in and out for me for a couple of days. Now how did I get here in this dire state of being? How did I not realize how sick I was? This is how I remember it in my faded memory. I recall not feeling right, a little more nervous than usual. I believe I let that voice in my head take control because I had lost control of my sensibility. Graves?s dysease is about hyperactivity in the thyroid and my whole system was a mess of nervous energy. I walked and walked; something I used to do as a child to get away from the arguing and violence between my parents. I lived in my head at that time. I remember moments of weakness but I would just sit for a while and then continue walking. I lived alone in North Van and I had isolated myself from family and friends. I remember going for a sauna one day and feeling as though my heart was going to bust out of my body. I lay down for a long time, before going back up to my apartment. That incident was very scary and got me to thinking sensibly for a moment. I realized that something was wrong. Also I was losing control of my bowel movements. I would sit and cry because I did not know what to do. Fortunately it was Christmas time and my family invited me spend the holidays with them in Langley. I made the decision then that I would call a family meeting and tell them about my situation It was Boxing Day and I had just attempted to walk up the stairs to take a nap. My heart began pumping as though I was in a race. I lied down for a moment and went back downstairs and told my daughter and my niece that I need to go to the hospital. They took me to a clinic the next day and the doctor (who was filling in for another doctor) knew immediately what was wrong with me. He called the hospital to tell them that I was coming in and had my family take me there ASAP . I was diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure caused by being in the final stages of Graves Dysease. I woke up and a very stout nurse with short dark hair was standing over me asking me if I was in pain. I said something like I felt like a truck had run over my chest. She commented that that was what it was like when your heart was a few times larger than normal. She briefed me on how to inject myself with the morphine that was attached to my hand, gave me some water and I drifted off to Neverland. I felt like I was living in someone else world. I was in a glassed room across the hall from ICU. It was mostly quite at least I think it was. I felt like I just wanted to lie there forever and let everyone around me decide what my life was to be. So what happened to help me mover forward...stay tuned",1

Following a myocardial infarction or heart attack, the Revivent TC System implants proprietary micro-anchor pairs to exclude scarred myocardium from the healthy tissue of the left ventricle (LV). The restoration of the LV to a more optimal volume and conical shape has proven to enhance cardiac performance and significantly improve a patient's quality of life 1 . ""The certification for CE marking is not only an important milestone for the company, but also for those who treat heart failure,"" said Mr. Kenneth Miller , President and Chief Executive Officer of BioVentrix. ""More importantly, it transforms the spectrum of treatment by offering a minimally invasive therapeutic solution for the previously ignored ventricle. By making this critical treatment available, we are giving physicians an important additional resource that they can utilize in conjunction with existing valvular and vascular therapies, making Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) even more effective. Moreover, it provides access to efficacious and tolerable therapy to many frail patients who previously would have no options,"" continued Mr. Miller. ""More than 100,000 patients will become eligible each year for this device implant,"" said Mr. Miller. ""Heart failure remains an epidemic worldwide and the CE marking certification validates the need for a novel therapy for heart failure patients suffering from left ventricular dysfunction,"" added Dr. Lon Annest , Chief Medical Officer of BioVentrix. ""There is no doubt that LV volume reduction is an important therapy as it directly impacts the parameters that determine prognosis and survival, such as LV volume and ejection fraction. The impact of the Revivent TC System is achieved by transcatheter access to exclude the ischemic portion of the left ventricle from the healthy tissue,"" continued Dr. Annest. ""This empowers heart teams in Europe , who currently have a backlog of patients, and soon, in the US, to ensure optimal clinical outcomes by minimizing the risk compared to conventional surgery,"" said Dr. Annest. At 2-year follow-up, patients have made remarkable improvements in their Quality of Life by 38%. Additionally, the clinical benefit has been proven to extend life for patients with a significant reduction of LV end-systolic volume index (31%) and improvement of LV ejection fraction (23%) 2 . Left ventricular volume reduction is especially critical for the survival of a patient as other studies have shown that significant LV volume reduction can directly prolong a patient's life 1 . The Revivent TC System is the only interventional therapy that can consistently achieve this survival benefit in heart failure patients. About the Revivent TC System and the LIVE(Less Invasive Ventricular Enhancement) Procedure Placement of the Revivent TC System via the LIVE TM procedure obviates the need for more invasive surgery. Instead, small titanium anchors are placed along the outer surface of the heart and along one of the interior walls via a closed-chest, endovascular approach. The anchors are then pulled toward one another, effectively excluding the scarred and non-functioning heart wall. Ventricular volume is immediately reduced as a result of the exclusion, by as much as 30-40 percent 3 . Click here for corporate video with animation About the LIVE TM Procedure: The World's Only Reshaping Left Ventricle Therapy The LIVE TM procedure is based upon a well-defined law of physics called the law of Laplace, which describes the relationship between the radius and pressure of the LV, and its resulting wall tension. Increased wall tension is the underlying cause of LV enlargement, worsening heart failure symptoms and ultimately patient death. Reducing wall tension is key to preventing further LV enlargement and treats the progression of the disease. The Revivent TC System, placed via the LIVE procedure, is uniquely designed to directly reduce the LV radius, which in turn decreases wall tension and interrupts the ongoing, destructive process of heart failure. 1 Michler R et al.

This is according to a new study published in The BMJ . For some patients with type 2 diabetes, antihypertensive medication may raise the risk of cardiovascular death. The researchers - including Mattias Brunstr?m of the Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine at Ume? University in Sweden - found that antihypertensive drugs may increase the risk of cardiovascular death for diabetes patients with a systolic blood pressure under 140 mm/Hg. While almost 1 in 2 people in the US have high blood pressure , or hypertension , the condition affects around 2 in 3 Americans with diabetes, putting them at higher risk of stroke , heart disease and other cardiovascular problems. As such, people with diabetes are often prescribed medication to help lower blood pressure. The American Diabetes Association recommend a systolic blood pressure target of less than 140 mm/Hg for patients with type 2 diabetes - the most common form of diabetes - though a target of less than 130 mm/Hg is recommended for some patients, if it can be achieved safely. For their study, Brunstr?m and his colleague Bo Carlberg, also of the Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine at Ume?, set out to investigate whether the effects of antihypertensive medication vary dependent on a patient's blood pressure prior to treatment. Increased cardiovascular death risk for some diabetes patients The team conducted a meta-analysis of 49 randomized controlled trials - involving a total of 73,738 participants - that looked at the cardiovascular outcomes of people with diabetes who were receiving blood pressure-lowering medication. The vast majority of participants had type 2 diabetes, and subjects were followed-up for at least 12 months. The team looked at the blood pressure of participants before treatment and assessed the cardiovascular effects of antihypertensive medication. The researchers found that participants whose blood pressure was higher than 140 mm/Hg before treatment had a reduced risk of stroke, heart attack , heart failure and all-cause mortality. Among subjects whose blood pressure was less than 140 mm/Hg prior to antihypertensive treatment, however, no cardiovascular benefits were identified. In fact, these participants were found to be at greater risk of cardiovascular death. Commenting on the findings, Brunstr?m says: ""Our study shows that intensive blood pressure-lowering treatment using antihypertensive drugs may be harmful for people with diabetes and a systolic blood pressure less than 140 mm/Hg."" The researchers stress that because most study participants had type 2 diabetes, their results may not apply to people with type 1 diabetes or those with diabetes who have normal blood pressure. Additionally, they point out that anti-hypertensive medication is crucial to most people with diabetes who have systolic blood pressure above 140 mm/Hg. ""In practice, it is important to remember that undertreatment of high blood pressure is a bigger problem than overtreatment,"" adds Brunstr?m. Still, the team says the findings could have important implications for clinical guidelines for diabetes patients with high blood pressure, noting that many countries are due to review such guidelines in the next few years. ""It has been discussed to recommend even lower blood pressure levels for people with diabetes - maybe as low as 130,"" says Brunstr?m. ""We are hoping that our study, which shows potential risks of such aggressive blood pressure-lowering treatment, will come to influence these guidelines.""

So far no 'race realist' has ever managed to explain what use race has. Take for example medicine - race has no utility whatsoever: ""These big groups that we characterize as races are too heterogeneous to lump together in a scientific way. If you're doing a DNA study to look for markers for a particular disease, you can't use 'Caucasians' as a group. They're too diverse."" (Naggert, 2000) Arbitrarily dividing humans into Caucasoids, Negroids and Mongoloids is not useful in medicine - since these groupings are too heterogeneous. Keith Norris............""Groups that self-identify as a given race may share biologic characteristics that originated as a result of shared ancestry. For example, persons of African descent in the United States who self-identify as black or African American are more likely to have certain biologic traits that were ancestrally protective in Africa, such as heterozygosity for sickle cell disease, which helps to protect against malaria, or the newly described APOL1 gene, which protects against trypanosomiasis (Science, 329:841-45, 2010). Of course, the allele that conveys malaria protection in heterozygotes causes sickle cell disease in those carrying two copies, and persons homozygous for the protective form of APOL1 are at increased risk for kidney failure. Thus, in settings where malaria and trypanosomiasis are rare, these biological traits are disadvantageous and may impart adverse health consequences. Other examples of biology correlating with race include the disparity among racial groups in the incidence of adverse effects noted with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, a class of drugs commonly used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. When these drugs are used, there are higher rates of angioedema in blacks than nonblacks, and higher rates of medication discontinuation owing to drug-induced cough in both blacks and Asians. More recently, colleagues and I reported racial and age differences in mortality rates for persons with end-stage renal disease treated with dialysis: most US minorities, especially at the higher end of the age spectrum, paradoxically showed increased longevity (Clin J Am Soc Nephrol, 8:953-61, 2013). Further, Cassianne Robinson-Cohen at the University of Washington and colleagues found that lower serum vitamin D concentrations were associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease among white or Chinese participants, but not among black or Hispanic participants (JAMA, 310:179-88, 2013). The role of race in medicine These and related findings clearly support the presence of race-related variations in disease risk, disease progression, treatment response, and treatment-related side effects. As such, there remains an important role for race/ethnicity, as a marker for ancestry and often for culture, as well as other sociodemographic traits, in characterizing patients with respect to medical care. These variables can be helpful in understanding key aspects of health beliefs, health behaviors, access to care, and likely response to therapeutic interventions. At the same time, we must be mindful that generalizations filtered through the lens of race/ethnicity and other sociodemographic factors should not be used indiscriminately. In the setting of increasing admixture within and across racial/ethnic groups in a diversifying United States, there is a lack of concordance between today?s patients and traditional racial stereotypes. Fortunately, genomic data are already beginning to predict disease risk and treatment response, and advances will no doubt continue to improve their accuracy. The ultimate goal is to arrive at a point where medicine becomes so personalized that it is driven from a ?fingerprint? of one?s biologic makeup, not from racial typecasting. We are still several steps away from such a reality. For now, the inclusion of race and ethnicity in medical research, like age, gender, and other characteristics, inches us closer to a system of personalized medicine that will truly embrace the multiple dimensions that influence our health and well-being"". Keith Norris is a nephrologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. He was the founding principal investigator for the first NIH?funded national translational research network dedicated to reducing health disparities, and he currently serves as the editor in chief of Ethnicity and Disease and as an associate editor for the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology. http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=...j6ALkQgQMIGzAA Medicine's Race Problem http://www.hoover.org/research/medicines-race-problem",0

The FDA announced that new warnings will be added to the labels of the two dipeptidyl peptidase?4 (DPP-4) inhibitor drugs, cautioning that they may increase the risk for heart failure, particularly in patients who already have cardiovascular or kidney disease. ""Health care professionals should consider discontinuing medications containing saxagliptin and alogliptin in patients who develop heart failure and monitor their diabetes control,"" an FDA statement notes. ""If a patient's blood sugar level is not well-controlled with their current treatment, other diabetes medicines may be required."" Combination products containing the two agents are also affected, including saxagliptin and metformin extended release (Kombiglyze XR, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP), alogliptin and metformin (Kazano, Takeda Pharmaceuticals), and alogliptin and pioglitazone (Oseni, Takeda Pharmaceuticals). The move follows an FDA internal safety review of two large cardiovascular outcomes trials of patients with cardiovascular disease and a recommendation for the label revision by the FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee during an April 2015 hearing. At that meeting, the panel expressed greater concern about heart failure for saxagliptin than for alogliptin, but because the mechanism is not clear and the two belong to the same class, the majority opted to recommend the warning on both labels. Results of the two studies ? Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus?Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 53 (SAVOR-TIMI 53) and Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin versus Standard of Care (EXAMINE) ? were first presented at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in 2013 and later published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In the saxagliptin trial, which included 16,492 patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease or who were at high risk for cardiovascular disease, there was no overall risk for cardiovascular events, but there was a 27% increase (3.5% vs. 2.8%) in the rate of the first event of hospitalization for heart failure and a potential increased risk for all-cause mortality. Risk factors included a history of heart failure or kidney impairment. In EXAMINE, which included a total of 5380 patients, 3.9% of patients receiving drug were hospitalized for heart failure vs 3.3% of patients receiving placebo. Although the difference was not statistically significant (hazard ratio, 1.19), heart failure was not an endpoint of the study.",0

If you have received a box full of chocolates, I hope it was the best kind. It seems too good to be true, but remember that not all chocolate is bad for us. Eating chocolate, especially dark chocolate, has known health benefits. It has been linked with a decrease in blood pressure and improvements in the ability of the body to respond to the hormone insulin. Can chocolate be good for you? Dark chocolate contains high levels of flavonols that exert antioxidant properties, and emerging evidence suggests a potential benefit of a variety of flavonol-rich foods and beverages on cardiovascular events. In a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with congestive heart failure. Researchers Flammer and colleagues compared the effect of commercially available flavonol-rich chocolate with cocoa-liquor-free control chocolate on endothelial and platelet function. They demonstrated that flavonol-rich chocolate acutely improves vascular function and inhibits platelet function in patients with congestive heart failure. The proposed mechanism includes the activation of nitric oxide and antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiplatelet effects, which in turn may improve endothelial function, lipid levels, blood pressure, and insulin resistance. While this research report didn?t say how much dark chocolate needs to be consumed to achieve results, a separate article says just 10 grams (40 calories) of dark chocolate is good for the heart. It basically only takes 30 calories of dark chocolate a day to lower the blood pressure of the participants in a 2006 study published in ?The Journal of the American Medical Association.? Participants consumed 6.3 grams of polyphenol-rich dark chocolate for a period of 18 weeks and saw their systolic blood pressure decline by 2.9 points and their diastolic blood pressure decline by 1.9 points. This change occurred without changes in body weight or other relevant factors. White chocolate doesn?t generate the same benefits. During the conventional chocolate manufacturing process from fresh cocoa seeds to the final product, the concentration of flavonols is markedly reduced. The term ?dark chocolate? is misleading; nothing about the color of the chocolate indicates the flavonol content. For example, the process of adding alkali-potash to cocoa nibs, also known as ?ditching? enhances the taste, texture, and appearance of the cocoa, eliminating the bitterness along with most of the active flavonols. Alkalization also results in a darkening of the cocoa, producing a very dark chocolate that is essentially devoid of flavonols. Fermentation and roasting also have a detrimental impact on the flavonol content of foods. In addition, the concentration of flavonols may depend on the origin of the raw cocoa. Milk chocolate has the lowest flavonol content compared with cocoa powder and dark chocolate. The caloric content of commercially available (around 500 kcal/100g) may cause weight gain, which is itself a risk factor for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. While a heart shaped box filled with bite size pieces of fruits and vegetables isn?t exactly screaming LOVE, the best step in enjoying chocolate in moderation is to exercise, follow a heart healthy diet to enhance cardiovascular health. Enjoy chocolate in moderation and don?t eat the whole box! Only in moderation.

There are many different aspects of going to medical school, but one of the final and most useful of these steps is attending and completing a cardiology fellowship so that you may become a licensed practicing cardiologist. This last step will teach you in the final ins and outs of the medical care and precision needed to keep the heart healthy throughout your life. Clinical and academic training make it possible for cardiologists to remain up to date with the newest trends, breakthroughs and future possibilities of medical care. Research is just as important as the hands on clinical experience, because these findings can improve the quality of medical care that is provided, change the ways that people view the medical community, and provide a solid basis for future research and modification of the field. What Can You Use a Cardiology Fellowship To Do? A Georgetown cardiology fellowship will prepare you for a career maintaining and studying the function of the heart and blood vessels that pertain to the heart. Potential careers include a focus on heart disease, heart failure and congenital heart disorders that both adults and children suffer from. The heart is responsible for supporting the function of the entire body, making it essential to keep it healthy by any meas necessary. Medical training that is obtained by finishing school and performing clinical rotations is always going to be valuable and an asset, but this is some of the most important non-surgical information that people can possess. While not a surgeon, a cardiologist is still a specialist for medical matters of the heart and can create, implement and help manage different treatment options for patients. Two of the most popular careers for those that complete the cardiovascular fellowship Washington DC are interventional cardiologists and electrophysiologists. Both of these require additional time and training after the initial fellowship, but are rewarding and absolutely necessary career paths. High blood pressure and high cholesterol are the main causes of damage and stress on the heart, and unfortunately these conditions and symptoms are on the rise.

Athersys has been frugal and focused on their therapies, taking extreme measures to perfect all aspects of the Multistem product. MESO on the other hand seems to have lost their way by spreading itself too thin and while their MSC product may be innovative in nature, they are still stuck in the traditional models of application of those therapies. The best example of this difference can be seen by how both companies are approaching Graft vs Host Disease. While MESO looks at a traditional model of trying to fix GvHD after onset through multiple doses, Athersys is there during the transplant with a single dose to prevent it from ever happening in the first place. Another example is Athersys focusing on AMI while MESO on CHF, all indications are that MSCs are specialized fighters for the body's immune reaction, so while it may work on CHF, the most bang for your buck is going to be in treatment of acute trauma which is where your body needs the most help. MESO seems stuck in the traditional reactive mode of the medical industry looking at applications that require multiple doses to get big dollars while providing incremental gains.

Usually in heart failure you try to increase bloodflow to the heart by dilating the coronary arteries. This is where the idea that some alcohol consumption may have cardioprotective effects. I don't know if it's proven but I think the European cardiology guidelines are on board for this. The other extreme is that too much alcohol is bad for the heart too. Red wine also has some sort of protein (whose name escapes me now; maybe sirtuins?) that could slow down cell replication and protect against cancer. It's all speculative though and every now and again we get contradictory research on this subject.,0

Was it worth it, absolutely. The trip of a lifetime. I just read today, your life is just two dates with a dash between them you have to make the most of the dash. I plan to continue to do that. Next year we are going on a cruise to Honduras, Belize, Cozumel and one other place in Mexico I can't remember right now.

The 40th president?s son, Michael Reagan, is now slamming the movie for deriving humor from his father?s battle with dementia. In the upcoming Reagan, which Ferrell is also producing, a White House intern is tasked with convincing the ailing president that he?s actually an actor playing the role of the president in a movie. In response to the news about the film, Michael Reagan tweeted, ?What an Outrag[e]. Alzheimers is not joke. It kills. You should be ashamed all of you.? He later added, ?Alzheimers is not a comedy!? Shortly following President Reagan?s death in 2004 after suffering from Alzheimer?s disease for nearly a decade, his son launched The Reagan Legacy Foundation, which aims to advance the former president?s causes and memorialize his accomplishments. Reagan?s wife, former First Lady Nancy Reagan, died just last month. Her cause of death was congestive heart failure. Reagan, of course, is not a biographical film, nor is it based on actual events, but many others on social media have also taken issue with the idea of poking fun at a disease that brings anguish to millions of people and their families. For his part, Ferrell has yet to respond to the controversy surrounding the upcoming film.",0

If you have heart failure, it means your heart isn?t pumping as well as it should be and, as a result, your body is probably not getting enough oxygen. In other words, you have a weak heart. Once-simple activities, like walking or carrying groceries, may become difficult, and you may also experience fatigue, shortness of breath, fluid build-up and coughing.1 Because heart failure is associated with fluid build-up, a low-salt diet is typically recommended. Excess sodium may cause your body to retain water and, so the conventional thinking goes, may worsen the fluid build-up associated with heart failure. This dietary dogma is touted as fact, but in reality you may want to think twice about slashing your salt intake if you have heart failure, as new research has linked it with an increased risk of death. Cutting Down Salt Intake Might Worsen Health of Heart Failure Patients Researchers from Rush University Medical Center in Chicago followed more than 800 heart failure patients for an average of three years. Both their health status and salt intake were analyzed.2 It turned out that those following a low-sodium diet were 85 percent more likely to die or require hospitalization for heart disease compared to those who didn?t restrict their salt intake.3 Among those restricting their sodium intake, 42 percent died or were hospitalized for heart problems during the study, compared to 26 percent of those with no salt restrictions. The researchers concluded, ?In symptomatic patients with chronic HF [heart failure], sodium restriction may have a detrimental impact on outcome.?4 It?s possible that restricting salt could backfire by altering a person?s fluid volumes. Lead researcher Dr. Rami Doukky told Medical Xpress:5 ?The idea is sodium restriction leads to a contraction of the fluid volume in the body, and that turns on certain hormones which try to retain fluids in the body and may potentially accelerate the heart failure process."" Heart Benefits of Salt Restriction Increasingly Questioned The heart benefits of restricting salt intake have been questioned for some time. In 2011, a systematic review of data involving 6,500 people also found evidence was lacking to recommend salt restriction.6 Among people with high blood pressure or normal blood pressure, salt restriction was not significantly associated with overall mortality or cardiovascular mortality. Among those with congestive heart failure, meanwhile, salt restriction was associated with increased mortality risk. An update to the review, published in 2014, also found ?there is insufficient power to confirm clinically important effects of dietary advice and salt substitution on cardiovascular mortality? among people with high blood pressure or normal blood pressure.7 Yet another meta-analysis found that people with heart failure who limited their sodium intake had a 160 percent higher risk of death than those who did not.8 Some studies have shown a modest benefit to salt restriction among some people with high blood pressure, but the evidence does not extend to the rest of the population. So what?s really going on? For starters, there?s a huge difference between natural salt and the processed salt added to processed foods and salt shakers in most homes and restaurants. The former is essential for good health, whereas the latter is best avoided altogether. Sally Fallon Morell, president of the Weston A. Price Foundation, stated:9 ""A study from 1991 indicates that people need about one and one-half teaspoons of salt per day. Anything less triggers a cascade of hormones to recuperate sodium from the waste stream, hormones that make people vulnerable to heart disease and kidney problems. This is proven biochemistry.? Too Little Salt May be Dangerous The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) recommend limiting your daily sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams (mg). They advise a further reduction to 1,500 mg (just over one-half teaspoon) for people who are age 51 and older, African-American, or who have hypertension, diabetes or chronic kidney disease (this encompasses about half of the U.S. population). However, there are very real risks from eating too little salt, and population-wide recommendations to restrict salt intake to very low levels could in fact increase rates of a wide range of diseases. For instance, in one study a low-salt diet led to an increase in insulin resistance, which is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes ? and the change occurred in just seven days.10 Research published in JAMA also found that consuming less than 3,000 mg of sodium per day may increase your risk of dying from heart disease.11 A low-sodium diet is even linked to increases in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides,12 and an increased risk of death for diabetics (another population that?s often advised to restrict their sodium intake).13 There?s also hyponatremia, in which your body has too little sodium, causing fluid levels to rise and your cells to swell. Hyponatremia is most common in older adults and athletes (whose sodium levels may become depleted by excessive sweating and drinking too much water). This swelling can cause a number of health problems, from mild to severe. At its worst, hyponatremia can be life threatening, leading to brain swelling, coma and death. But mild to moderate hyponatremia has more subtle effects that you or your health care provider may not even connect with a sodium-deficiency problem, including: Nausea, vomiting, and changes in appetite Headache Confusion Hallucinations Loss of energy Fatigue Urinary incontinence Nervousness, restlessness and irritability, and other mood changes Muscle weakness, spasms or cramps Seizures Unconsciousness Coma Your Sodium:Potassium Ratio Another factor that can have a significant impact on whether salt will harm or help your health is the ratio between the salt and potassium in your diet. Your body needs potassium to maintain proper pH levels in your body fluids, and it also plays an integral role in regulating your blood pressure. It?s possible that potassium deficiency may be more responsible for hypertension (which is a risk factor for heart disease) than excess sodium. Imbalance in your sodium:potassium ratio can lead to hypertension, and the easiest way to achieve this imbalance is by consuming a diet of processed foods, which are notoriously low in potassium while high in sodium. Processed foods are also loaded with fructose, which is clearly associated with increased hypertension risk, as well as virtually all chronic diseases. This may also explain why high-sodium diets appear to affect some people but not others. According to a 2011 federal study into sodium and potassium intake, those at greatest risk of cardiovascular disease were those who got a combination of too much sodium along with too little potassium.14 According to Dr. Elena Kuklina, one of the lead authors of the study, potassium may neutralize the heart-damaging effects of salt. Tellingly, those who ate a lot of salt and very little potassium were more than twice as likely to die from a heart attack as those who ate about equal amounts of both nutrients. While potassium is found in many foods commonly consumed in the U.S. ? including fruits, vegetables, dairy products, salmon, sardines, and nuts ? only 2 percent of U.S. adults get the recommended daily amount of 4,700 mg.15 The easiest way to achieve an imbalance in your sodium-to-potassium ratio is by consuming a diet of processed foods, which are notoriously low in potassium while high in processed salt. According to the FDA, 77 percent of Americans sodium intake comes from processed and restaurant foods; when you reduce processed foods in your diet, you?ll automatically reduce your intake of processed salt as well. How to Improve Your Sodium-Potassium Ratio If you eat a lot of processed foods and not many vegetables, there?s a good chance your sodium-to-potassium ratio is unbalanced. If you?re not sure, try a free app like My Fitness Pal, which allows you to enter the foods you eat and then calculates the ratio automatically. It's generally recommended that you consume five times more potassium than sodium, but most Americans get two times more sodium than potassium. If your ratio is out of balance: Ditch all processed foods, which are very high in processed salt and low in potassium and other essential nutrients Eat a diet of whole, unprocessed foods, ideally organically and locally grown to ensure optimal nutrient content. This type of diet will naturally provide much larger amounts of potassium in relation to sodium When using added salt, use a natural salt. I believe Himalayan salt may be ideal, as it contains lower sodium and higher potassium levels compared to other salts16It can be difficult to get enough potassium from diet, but the best way to do so is to increase the amount of vegetables you consume. Green vegetable juicing is an excellent way to ensure you?re getting enough nutrients for optimal health, including about 300 to 400 mg of potassium per cup. Some additional rich sources of potassium are: Lima beans (955 mg/cup) Winter squash (896 mg/cup) Cooked spinach (839 mg/cup) Avocado (500 mg per medium)Other potassium-rich fruits and vegetables include: Fruits: papayas, prunes, cantaloupe, and bananas. (But be careful of bananas as they are high in sugar and have half the potassium of an equivalent amount of green vegetables. It is a myth that you are getting loads of potassium from bananas; the potassium is twice as high in green vegetables) Vegetables: broccoli, Brussels sprouts, avocados, asparagus, pumpkin, Swiss chard, and beet greens Top Tips to Prevent Heart Failure and Other Heart Problems There are many strategies that can protect your heart no matter what your age. Please don't wait until you experience heart attack symptoms or heart failure to take action because by then it may be too late. Do so now in order to prevent any long-lasting damage: Eat unprocessed saturated animal fats, and ignore the media, as you will benefit from these fats. Many may also benefit from increasing the healthy fat in their diet to 50 to 85 percent of daily calories. Avoid sugars, including processed fructose and grains if you are insulin and leptin resistant. It doesn't matter if they are conventional or organic, as a high-sugar, high-grain diet promotes insulin and leptin resistance, which is a primary driver of heart disease. Minimize your intake of salt from processed foods and instead use natural Himalayan salt to flavor your real food. Exercise regularly. People who engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise a week, had a 33 percent lower risk of heart failure than inactive people.17 Use a combination of high-intensity interval training, strength training, stretching, and core work. Avoid excess sitting; aim for three hours a day or less of sitting and try to take 10,000 steps a day (in addition to your exercise program). Regularly walk barefoot to ground with the earth. When you do, free electrons are transferred from the earth into your body; this grounding effect is one of the most potent antioxidants we know of and helps alleviate inflammation throughout your body. Manage your stress daily. One of my favorite tools for stress management is the Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT).",0

He died a few hours later from heart failure after a severe bleeding. The retiree had been cremated without autopsy and the family had accidentally discovered that the urologist had been suspended from all activities the block. She then filed a complaint on March 3 against the surgeon. ?The surgeon was in a second mental state?, on Monday accused the lawyer of the girl patient, Me Philippe Courtois, at a press conference in Paris. ?It is not a therapeutic hazard but a medical error caused by repeated brutal acts? of the urologist. For him, the hospital made a ?mistake? for ?not reporting this death without explanation? to justice.

The time it takes for you to decompensate and become volume overloaded will depend on your cardiac function. When you become volume overloaded the pressure will cause pulmonary oedema (the intravascular pressure pushes the fluid out of the pulmonary vessels into your lungs) due to congestive heart failure. Your pulmonary circulation is a low pressure system and that is why you will develop pulmonary signs first, but eventually other parts of your body will also become oedematous. You will become short of breath finding it increasingly difficult to breath. You will not be able to lie down anymore as the shortness of breath is worse when you lie flat (orthopnoea). The pulmonary oedema worsens you become hypoxic (low levels of oxygen in your blood) and you turn blue (cyanosis). You become more short of breath. You feel as if you are suffocating. You lose consciousness. You develop hypoxic brain injury, probably a stroke as well due to the hypertensive crisis. You die. The above mentioned would be if you received whole blood as it left the unfortunate donor. The scenario can play out a little differently if you were given blood from bloodpacks (due to the preservatives in the blood and the metabolism that ""older"" blood undergoes). I will post that if you keen to hear how you might die in that scenario.",0

Doesn't seem to make much difference. This is why I dislike fads, especially scientific ones that aren't proven. A lot of people bought into ""standing desks"" only to now learn they aren't healthy for you either. Quote: If there?s anything scientists know about the best type of desk for an office worker?s long-term health, it?s that they don?t really know anything, according to a new analysis of the scientific literature on the matter. After closely examining 20 of the highest quality studies about workplace interventions to reduce sitting time, which include standing, pedaling, and treadmill desks, researchers concluded that there simply isn?t enough data to say whether any of the alternatives are better that just plopping in front of a standard desk. A number of studies in the past had found that planting your bum in an office chair for hours at a time can up your chances of heart failure, disabilities, and even shorten your life. Collectively, the data spurred a trend for alternative workstations that are aimed at reversing those negative effects, boosting calorie burning, and improving overall health. But the reviewers say it?s unclear if such solutions make the mark. To-date, the studies on the alternatives did show that they can cut down on 30 minutes-to-two hours? worth of sitting time. But all of the studies have been too small and/or poorly designed to definitely give an answer on whether that has an impact on health, the researchers report in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The studies included a total of only 2174 participants, rarely had randomized controls, and only followed health outcomes for up to six months. ""What we actually found is that most of it is, very much, just fashionable and not proven good for your health,"" Jos Verbeek, a review coauthor and health researcher at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, told NPR. ""The idea you should be standing four hours a day? There's no real evidence for that,"" he added. ""I would say that there's evidence that standing can be bad for your health."" For instance, an earlier study found that standing for long periods may increase the risk for needing medical attention for enlarged veins. While the authors urge that more, high-quality studies are needed to evaluate the health impacts of different workstations, they concluded so far: Quote: Sit-stand desks did not have a considerable effect on work performance, musculoskeletal symptoms, or sick leave. It remains unclear if standing can repair the harms of sitting because there is hardly any extra energy expenditure. Ars Technica",0

This is not always the scenario, even with a large heart attack. Although some heart attacks are more dramatic than others, a heart attack is always serious. Whether a heart attack is mild or severe, you can improve your odds of living the longest, healthiest life possible if you know what to do. What Causes Heart Attacks? All heart attacks occur when circulation of blood to the heart is blocked. If the blockage is not rapidly opened, heart tissue will die from a lack of oxygen. Most often, a heart attack, also called myocardial infarction (MI), is a result of coronary heart disease (CHD). Coronary heart disease is a narrowing of the coronary arteries, which bring blood into the heart muscle. Coronary heart disease is most often caused by atherosclerosis, a buildup of fatty plaque on the artery walls. Narrowed coronary arteries reduce blood flow to the heart muscle and can cause chest pain (angina), especially during exercise or stress. In addition, blood clots form more easily in a narrowed artery damaged by fatty plaques. A blood clot can completely block blood flow, causing a heart attack and life-threatening heart damage. Angina is not a heart attack, but if it does not go away with rest or after taking nitroglycerin, it is a sign of a developing heart attack. What Is a Mild Heart Attack? A mild heart attack affects a relatively small portion of the heart muscle, or does not cause much permanent heart damage. This is because the blockage in a coronary artery occurs in a small artery that supplies a small portion of the heart muscle; does not completely block blood flow to the heart; or lasts briefly. It is a common misconception that a mild heart attack is not serious. Even if the area of the heart affected is small, a heart attack can result in permanent heart damage and life-threatening problems that affect you for the rest of your life, including heart failure, an abnormal heart beat (arrhythmia), and a higher risk of a second heart attack. What Is a Massive Heart Attack? A massive heart attack affects a large portion of the heart muscle, or causes a large amount of heart damage. This can happen if the blockage in a coronary artery occurs in a large artery that supplies a large portion of the heart; completely blocks blood flow to the heart; or lasts for a long period of time. A massive heart attack can result in collapse, cardiac arrest (when your heart stops beating), and rapid death or permanent heart damage. A massive heart attack can also lead to heart failure, arrhythmia, and a higher risk of a second hear",0

""I believe that this study will serve as a roadmap towards saving a significant number of lives.""About one-third of U.S. adults have high blood pressure. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for a variety of health problems, including heart attacks, strokes and heart failure. Most blood pressure charts recommend that high blood pressure patients reduce their systolic blood pressure. Cardiologists consider this to be the more important of the two readings from a blood pressure measurement, to a maximum of 140.The study set out to determine whether lower systolic blood pressure might be even better. Researchers recruited more than 9,300 adults with high blood pressure and at least one other risk factor for heart disease, i.e. being a smoker or having high cholesterol. The subjects were slip in half, half of the doctors attempted to get the systolic pressure down to 140 in some patients. The other half attempted to reduce the systolic pressure to 120.The study was supposed to continue until well into 2016, but it was stopped recently when a panel monitoring the results found in a preliminary analysis that it had already produced significant results. ??It was concluded reducing systolic blood pressure to 120 or lower reduced heart attacks, strokes and heart failure by almost a third and the risk of death by almost a quarter,"" Gibbons says. rt Center of Indiana, vice president of the American College of Cardiology.The study acknowledged it may be difficult for patients to hit the lower target.

I can understand your concern. Only Troponin levels are not confirmatory of heart diseases. Sometimes, Troponin levels can be normal and patient is still having heart diseases. Her symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath etc are commonly seen with heart failure and coronary heart disease (CAD).. So better to consult cardiologist and get done 1. Ecg 2. 2d echo 3. Stress test (trade mill test). All these are needed to confirm heart diseases. If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes lung infection, bronchitis can also cause similar symptoms. So also get done chest x ray and PFT (pulmonary function test). So, first diagnose her and then start appropriate treatment.

So, I am not highly focused on his age right now because aside from trauma, there are not many common reasons for a 22 yo to have these symptoms. But we do not have a thorough history on OP and there are many things that could put him at a higher risk for DVT than he has mentioned, or may be wanting to mention in a public forum. Lymphedema would not necessarily be a more reassuring diagnoses as it is often a secondary symptom of an underlying condition and is most frequently a result of cancer treatment and surgeries, which OP did not mention. I doubt chronic venous insufficiency due to the precipitous nature of this presentation and CHF for the same reason. Wells score are helpful if you are doing a differential in the ED, but I guarantee that every nurse and medical provider in the ED will want to assess for a DVT despite any Wells score (which is a limited tool). I certainly would never recommend anyone calculate their Wells scores themselves, based on advice from this forum, and opt to not go to the ED for further assessment. As mentioned in my post, those tests will be helpful. Any ED will immediately do those. If he does not have a DVT then a more thorough outpatient workup can start. You've cast a wide differential diagnosis net, but my concern was for the immediate risk to wellness and life that a DVT be ruled out, hopefully. I'm hoping that OP has already been to the ED by the time we are making these comments, so I wouldn't hold out for an anterior (from the front) view photo. edit: ah!

She has debunked a recent police report that her son was an armed robber , adding that the security officers are hiding something under their sleeves. Speaking on Atinka FM?s political show ?Simpieso? Tuesday , the aggrieved mother raised some crucial concerns that it was unusual for the Police Administration to suddenly decide they would foot the mortuary bills of the deceased, engage their musical band at the victim?s funeral grounds. She further explained that such a gesture from them does not apply to all the deceased persons who are shot by the police. After the killing of the gentleman, the police led by DCOP Kofi Boakye did their investigation and said their hands were clean. An announcement which did not go down well with the bereaved family; and their pain was aggravated when the autopsy report suggest that their son died from a heart failure. This was rejected by the family. The police went further to confiscate the mortal remains of the victim saying they would only release the body upon the family?s acceptance of the autopsy report. Chief of the area Nana Sarponghene intervene and called for a mutual settlement. Reports indicated that top police officers from Accra met with the family and Nana Sarponghene. The body of the late Koo Tawiah was released to them in addition to a police report which stated that the deceased was an armed robber. Indeed the autopsy report and that of the police conflict. The mother alleged that the police had taken her late son?s cell phones. She cursed and cast a spell on all those who been involved in the incident.

Depression is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but as a person?s depression improves ? or grows worse ? their risk for heart disease has remained largely unknown. But now, a new study by researchers at the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Salt Lake City found that effectively treating depression can reduce a patient?s chance of having a stroke, heart failure, a heart attack or death. In fact, effective treatment for depression can reduce a patient?s heart risks to the same level as those who never had short-term depression, the study found. ?Our study shows that prompt, effective treatment of depression appears to improve the risk of poor heart health,? said Heidi May, PhD, a cardiovascular epidemiologist with the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute. ?With the help of past research, we know depression affects long-term cardiovascular risks, but knowing that alleviating the symptoms of depression reduces a person?s risk of heart disease in the short term, too, can help care providers and patients commit more fully to treating the symptoms of depression,? she said. ?The key conclusion of our study is: If depression isn?t treated, the risk of cardiovascular complications increases significantly.? Dr. May presented her findings at the 2016 American College of Cardiology Scientific Sessions in Chicago on April 2. Researchers haven?t completely understood whether a short-term encounter with depression affects a person?s cardiovascular risk forever, or how changes in the symptoms of depression over time affect cardiovascular risk. Dr. May and her team found answers to these questions by studying data compiled in Intermountain Healthcare?s depression registry, a database of more than 100,000 patients. ?There?s little publically-available data about this question,? Dr. May said. ?But now with the help of Intermountain?s depression registry, we have the ability to start answering some of these difficult questions.? The Intermountain Medical Center Heart research team compiled information from 7,550 patients who completed at least two depression questionnaires over the course of one to two years. Patients were categorized based on the results of their survey as never depressed, no longer depressed, remained depressed, or became depressed. Following each patient?s completion of the last questionnaire, patients were followed to see if they had any major cardiovascular problems such as a stroke, heart failure, heart attack or death. At the conclusion of the study, 4.6 percent of patients who were no longer depressed had a similar occurrence of major cardiovascular complications as those who had no depression at all (4.8 percent). Those who remained depressed, however, and those who became depressed throughout the study, had increased occurrences of major cardiovascular problems ? their rates were 6 and 6.4 percent, respectively. Treatment for depression resulted in a decreased risk of cardiovascular risk that was similar to someone who didn?t have depression. As for the practical application of this study, Dr. May said the research indicates that effective treatment for depression decreases the risk of having cardiovascular problems in the short term, but further study is needed to identify exactly what that treatment should include. ?What we?ve done thus far is simply observe data that has previously been collected,? Dr. May said. ?In order to dig deeper, we need do a full clinical trial to fully evaluate what we?ve observed.? Because of the complex nature of depression, it?s hard to say whether depression leads to risk factors associated with cardiovascular problems, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, diabetes or a lack of exercise ? or if it?s the other way around. Results from the study indicate that changes in depression symptoms may also cause immediate physiological changes in the body, which in turn cause major cardiovascular problems to occur in the short term, but future studies are needed to further answer these questions. Other researchers involved in the study include Kimberly Brunisholz, PhD; Benjamin Horne, PhD; Brent J. Muhlestein, MD; Tami Bair, RN; Donald Lapp?, MD; Adam B. Wilcox, PhD; and Brenda Reiss-Brennan, PhD, APRN. Intermountain Medical Center is the flagship facility for the Intermountain Healthcare system, which is based in Salt Lake City.",0

In 2008, the Centers replacing Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that five diseases account for more than 65 percent of the deaths of American retinue. Yowl, again people finally come off see the doctor for their ailments, all the doctor can do is attempt into offer temporary treatments. Surplus the years there has been a lack of education about nutrition and diet in medical schools, and unfortunately, that ebbing continues inside many re today?s medical academic specialty. Ingress an article by David Freudberg, ?medical Students Discuss ?red Flags? Somewhere about the Future as to Health Care?, he says: ?]? ]But medical school correctly has not run-in doctors very freshwater lake in helping patients conclude through lifestyle choices. Even inwardly a society rife with diet-related illness ? not counting heart disease to diabetes to widespread obesity ? nutrition education dead body curiously marginalized therein surgical washington.? Ask doctors how to treat diabetes, and they can give ourselves a number of answers, but ask them exactly what can be done to arrest this disease, they may draw a blank. A medical student?s resolution to this is that the course touching study for medical school is so far daunting and stressful without having to add more classes in virtue of slim and omnivorism. I?m pretty sure there are classes that are not exactly a necessity. For premed courses, she could probably cut beside the mark a chemistry or physics class and repay it with a herbivorousness confession. Classes that fudge a practical application in the solid world re medicine should encounter precedence over a traditional curriculum. If you?re a aid, it?s important to remember that you are not just adamite there to well-put enjoin a pill and spoof the patient on their merry way. You also have to consider i myself a marksman, and many of your patients decision have questions about what self should or shouldn?t finish off beaucoup that they can be healthier. And after all if they don?t ask, I believe it?s your approval to share your knowledge on actions inner man can take to prevent diseases. Having a good rapport and communication with patients can help prevent medical malpractice. HERSELF further believe that hospitals or monadic putting together employing healthcare professionals should provide ongoing classes crown workshops on the latest traffic at close quarters diets and nutrition. We have to remember that doctors have to be cloth role models and eat healthy and also.

I often wonder what they did in the past, when it was no available. I went six months without it, and then broke down and eventually had heart failure. I appreciate it now that I am using it. This is why they say it is a medication. I went six months without it, and had no idea what was exactly wrong with my health, and had not idea it was oxygen related due to lung condition. But, after six months of having very low oxygen, and now regaining the oxygen, thanks to concentrated oxygen, there is such a difference, and I appreciate/love it. I hate that we have to wear the silly cannula and tubes, and carry a tank around when we either are in bounded or out bounded, but I do believe it when they say that we live longer if we use it! I do it mainly for myself, and my family. Your family should be proud that you are using it, since it is helping your health and causing you to live longer. I am sure they are...it does seem it may be yourself being self conscious? That is very uncomfortable, but in my opinion, if someone doesn't like looking at someone who has a lung handicap, then they have the problem, not myself, and No, I will not allow other people to dominate my go abouts either. If they don't like it, then get use to it, is what I would say to them! I do get a kick out of small children calling me monster or other names, but I just smile at them. It is the older ones, who have the problem, and I personally don't care to know them...but honestly, I never seem to have the problem with other adults....instead, they smile at me and help me (if I need it). I knew when I first wore oxygen, that it is either be a prisoner at home, or, go out and be glad that I am alive and enjoy life in bound and out of bound (home). Also, my children and husband will have it no other way we don't have other family in my location, just sons and husband, but I do it for them, because we have soooo much fun together! I just can't let others make me stay indoor's like a prisoner, and I hope you make that decision too, and once you make that decision, stick to it. I am not ashamed of wearing oxygen, since it saved my life too. xo",1

She graduated from The University of Texas at Austin at the age of 19 and was pleased that her children and some of her grandchildren followed in her footsteps there.? The obituary goes on to say, ?until her death, Elene honored an obligation to preserve her family?s Southern legacy, personally undertaking the restoration of the Jewish Cemetery in Lafayette, Louisiana and maintaining her membership in the Jefferson Davis Chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy. A student of history, she felt strongly that political correctness was an excuse to erase facts and history and she deplored the misinformed, the ill-informed and the mal-informed and thus made no apologies for the Truth, which she demanded from her children and others at all times.? Davis? family explained in the obituary, Davis was ?the first woman in the world to be treated pre-metastatically with Interferon? The use of Interferon has since saved the lives of thousands of cancer patients worldwide.? To read the entire obituary click here. (?2016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.

In essence, rebuild was being planned when Das Dritte Reich was still very much intact. Adolf Hitler had predicted that after the fall of Germany, the Allies would confront its present ally the Soviet Union led them to believe that what actually happened after the war was going to happen. General George S Patton was highly criticised for working with tens of thousands of former members of the National Socialist German regime and his explanation was very straightforward and could be translated as ""They ran the country and they are the ones who know how to ran the country"". This is why the new Germany was actually built by National Socialist Germans. Some heads would roll to give the idea that the Allies' kind of justice was being done but in essence very little was done because they needed National Socialist Germans to prepare for what he foresaw as the next battle. George S Patton went as far as saying that the US might have fought against the wrong enemy. How many former members of the Nationalist Socialist Germany regime were actually captured in Latin America? None. The one member of the regime that was captured was captured by Jewish agent. No one else was touched by the so called Allies justice system. SS officers, Wehrmacht officers and other influential figures prospered not just in Latin America where Josef Mengele was married under his real name in Uruguay and later migrated where he died of heart failure at a Brazilian resort. The truth is the US needed National Socialist Germans and this is why high ranking figures of the regime were employed by the US government and by the new authorities in Germany proper. The man that invented the V1 and the V2, Wernher von Braun, became the head of the US Space Programme that took men to the Moon. Commander Heinz Guderian that led the attack against France in 1940 was employed to rebuild the German Armed Forces. Across Latin America, former German military man played a fundamental role during the World War Two and and after World War Two. Things went as far as rewriting the history of former members of the National Socialist regime so that it would be acceptable to employ them. In 1946, at an important meeting in Europe there were things points to be discussed: 1) protecting members of the National Socialist Movement from persecution. 2) Capital investment to fund the National Socialist Movement and 3) posting of loyal members of the Nationalist Socialist Movement in position of influence in Germany and outside Germany. What we call European Union today was very much part of the plan and is the one thing that would allow Germany to play a decisive role in Europe. Despite the fact that there are now 28 countries in the European Union, Germany is the one that has the last word in every fundamental decision. How is the European Union run? The executive organ of the European Union called European Commission is made up with appointed 'non elected' members and it the European Commission that has a lead role that supersedes the European Parliament - a very easy tool to push measures across the entire EU with little opposition and this complemented by a Judiciary whose decisions take precedence over decisions made by any other authority.",0

BLOG,myhostileuterus.blogspot.com,http://myhostileuterus.blogspot.com/2016/07/waiting-is-hardest-part.html,7/17/2016,8:47:00,,,"8 Weeks 1 day. Making it to Friday seemed like it would never come. Part of me was impatient, and the other part of me hoped it really wouldn't come. The reality is Friday did come. I went into the fertility office that day doing anything and everything I could to not focus on what was going to happen. As they called my name, I took a deep breath and hoped for the best. The nurse Debbie took me back, she had been through this with us for the last 9 months, but we knew the risks this time were higher. As she did the typical check in, I said to her, """" we are hoping for good news, I prayed for the first time in 16 years."""" She became tearful, hugged me, and reminded me that everyone was praying and hoping for good news. When the Dr came in to start the ultra sound it was almost as if we were pretending things were not that bad, Katie who had came in place of Mike due to work obligations, stood next to me. She asked """"do you need me to hold you"""" or something to that affect, and I remember saying """"no"""", as my whole world started to spin. As the Dr. looked around, I focused on finding the heart beat. I had done this, and experienced this enough, that I knew if it was there I would see it. Panic started to sink in, it wasn't there. I looked at the screen and away at the wall, a million times in full panic. The room was so quiet, which increased my worry more. I had to ask """"do you see the heart beat?"""" I swear I asked 5 times, before the response registered. He told me, there's another bloodclot by the placenta, and it looks like its pulling down and away. """"Why don't you sit up, and we will talk."""" WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I felt like he was walking around giving me answer. He continued to tell me that the heart beat was not there, the placenta was pulling away because the pregnancy was over. The baby stopped growing at 7 weeks 1 day, and it appears there was something structural wrong. I asked about the congestive heart failure, he said it appeared that this was why the heart isn't beating. I sat there trying not to cry, holding it together as well as I could, looking away from him, because the eye contact would only make it worse. Three options were given to me. One; wait to miscarry on my own, two; take medication to force the miscarriage into place, or three; have a D&C. I originally said I didn't know what I wanted to do. The truth is I was half between screaming, """"you're lying,"""" and the other half wanting to scream """"get the baby out now.""""It's cowardly, I know, but I was loosing it, and hanging on by this little piece of hope, that didn't really exist. The Dr. said I didn't have to decide right then, and I could call. As I left Debbie stopped me, she hugged me, and took me into their lab room. She gathered tissues, while the other nurse April hugged me, and sat me down. She handed me a kit for genetic testing. (You take the sample if you miscarry at home, who even knew such a thing existed.) Debbie asked if I was doing the medication. I told her I didn't know what to do. She told me it caused pain, and it was hurtful, which quickly helped me make up my mind. I decided to go home and wait. If it didn't happen on it's own I would have the D&C Tuesday. Waiting is the hardest part. I have been carrying around this kit for a little over 2 days, every bathroom visit is plagued with fear, and the thought of am I strong enough to do this kit at home lays firmly on my mind. I keep going through the emotions, they come in waves. I cry. I find happiness in simple things. I cry tears of joy when my little Addy comforts me, or plays Dr. and reminds me that """"your heart is hurt."""" (It's funny the things kids know.) But the hurt my heart is feeling, is terrible. My heart is hurting for me, and my husband, and our family, and I feel the weight of the world. And still we must wait. Last night I laid in the bathtub, submerged in the water. I had my head down as far as it could go, the water to edges of my outer eye. I laid there numb, as the tears flowed, they streamed right into the water. The relief of them not sliding down my face, was somehow relaxing. I relived the last three weeks, I relived the fear, the heart ache, and the excitement that all comes with pregnancy, and I grieved, or started to. We don't know all that is coming, and we don't have to. But what I do know is that we have each other, and we are lucky for that. We have one happy and healthy little girl, and nothing can replace that. Our fertility journey may not be over, and this may just be a bump in the road, but right now it's our lives and we are just trying to survive it. I wavered back and forth on wether or not to share this post, partially because its personal, and in part because it's a sad reality no one wants to hear. But over these years, we have met, supported, and been supported by so many on our first fertility journey, and through this one. I felt it was only fair to be honest that not every story ends with a baby, although we wish it would. We are currently 8 weeks 3 days, and still waiting to miscarry, as I am reminded each time we leave the house and I have to grab """"the kit"""". The reality is our baby is gone, and as much as I wish that little heart would start beating again, its not going to. Sometimes I fear that mine will stop too, but the truth is, it won't, and I as well as my family will keep going.",1

No Comments Problems related to elderly patients' medical drug treatments are widespread and commonly result in hospital admissions for people with dementia. New research shows that including clinical pharmacists in health care teams might improve the quality and safety of patient care and halve the risk of drug-related hospital readmissions. This according to a dissertation at Umea University in Sweden. Doctoral student and clinical pharmacist Maria Gustafsson at the Department of Community Medicine and Rehabilitation at Umea University has carried out a randomised, controlled trial in the northern Swedish county V?sterbotten among 460 people from 65 years and above suffering from dementia or cognitive impairment. The participants had, at some point between 2012 and 2015, been admitted to internal medicine and orthopaedic wards at two hospitals in northern Sweden. ""When analysing all patient causes of the original admission, before the study intervention was performed, we found that as many as 41 per cent of all admissions were related to medication events. The most common problem is adverse drug reaction, but also excessively high dosage and noncompliance is unfortunately common,"" says Maria Gustafsson. Related Stories Measuring brain signal variability could help identify patients at higher risk of dementia The study was based on an intervention, where clinical pharmacists participated in health care teams and controlled if individual patients' drug lists were correct and complete. They also performed comprehensive analyses of all the drugs a patient was taking and suggested potential improvements to the physician in charge as well as initiated discussions in the health care team. ""The results after the intervention showed that clinical pharmacists' participation in health care teams reduced the risk of drug-related hospital readmissions by half during the follow-up time of 180 days,"" says Maria Gustafsson. In patient groups with heart failure, no effect of the pharmacist intervention was observed. For the group as a whole, the intervention also reduced the risk of early drug-related hospital readmissions, i.e. those within 30 days. The study also showed that antipsychotic and other psychotropic drugs were common among people with dementia in specialised care units. The drugs were also used for long periods of time, which is inconsistent with prevailing treatment guidelines. According to the study, there is a link between several behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, such as aggressive behaviour, and widespread prescribing of antipsychotics and other psychotropic substances. This indicates that psychotropics are sometimes used to treat symptoms among people with dementia, despite known risks of adverse effects and limited research evidence supporting the treatment's efficacy. ""Drug treatment-related problems in elderly people with dementia are very common and more work is needed in order to prevent, identify and treat these problems in this part of the population,"" says Maria Gustafsson.

Top-line data from each are expected in the second half of 2017. ""The heart's reduced ability to relax and contract during heart failure may be linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and a resulting lack of energy in heart muscle,"" said Stealth Vice President of Clinical Development Jim Carr . ""Since muscle is required for both pumping and re-filling the heart, we believe elamipretide could address this lack of energy in the heart muscle in the two major forms of heart failure by improving mitochondrial function."" PROGRESS-HF and RESTORE-HF are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the effects of four weeks' treatment with daily subcutaneous injections of elamipretide on left ventricular function in patients with stable heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (PROGRESS-HF) or preserved ejection fraction (RESTORE-HF). The primary endpoint of PROGRESS-HF is change from baseline in the volume of blood remaining in the left ventricle at end of contraction, as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Secondary endpoints will include additional measures of cardiac function, including ejection fraction, by echocardiography and MRI. The primary endpoints of RESTORE-HF are changes in diastolic heart function at rest and during submaximal stress, as assessed by echocardiography. Secondary endpoints include changes in exercise capacity, as measured by the six-minute walk test, and responses to the SF36 patient-reported health survey. ""Our initiation of these Phase 2 trials marks an important milestone for Stealth and the progression of our cardiorenal program for elamipretide. Following the promising findings from our Phase 1 PREVIEW trial in heart failure, we hope to demonstrate improvements in heart function across both types of heart failure with longer-term dosing,"" said Stealth Chief Executive Officer Reenie McCarthy . For additional information on PROGRESS-HF , RESTORE-HF or elamipretide, please refer to Stealth's website and ClinicalTrials.gov. About Heart Failure Heart failure affects approximately 21 million people in the United States and Europe , and the incidence is anticipated to increase as the population continues to age. The disease is characterized by a reduced ability to relax and contract the heart to pump blood throughout the body. Heart failure comes in two forms, based on changes in the amount of blood the left ventricle pumps out with each contraction, known as ejection fraction. Both forms, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and the resulting lack of energy in the heart muscle. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and only limited treatments for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. About Elamipretide Stealth's lead candidate, elamipretide , is an investigational drug with the potential to modify disease by preserving energetics and restoring normal energy production in mitochondria, while decreasing oxidative stress. The energetics from mitochondria maintain healthy physiology and prevent disease. This mitochondria-targeted candidate is being developed for both rare and common diseases. Stealth BioTherapeutics: Leading Mitochondrial Medicine Stealth BioTherapeutics is a privately held biopharmaceutical company committed to bringing mitochondrial therapies to patients to treat both rare and common diseases.

Defensive medicine?","Raryn said: ? SIRS is a concept with excellent sensitivity to get you to consider (systemic) infection, and obviously no specificity. Spring down the hall and you will probably meet SIRS, but you obviously don't have a focus for infection and will be back to normal pretty quickly. There's some question of there being septic patients who don't meet SIRS, but that all depends on whose definition of sepsis you use, and for a quick initial screen it isn't bad. OTOH, the new (q)SOFA score in the sepsis guidelines that came out in February seems useless. The only things in the qSOFA are RR, HoTN, and AMS... and if you need a scoring system to tell you to investigate AMS or HoTN, you should probably go back to medical school (or become a pathologist). The full SOFA is even worse, going from 4 reasonably easy parameters to remember (SIRS) to ~8 parameters each with 4-5 different numbers to keep in mind because of how points are tallied up. It's practically impossible to calculate without an app/website and doesn't really affect management at all. An elevated SOFA just tells you that the patient has organ dysfunction... which you can see from the organ dysfunction you had to identify to calculate the SOFA. Edit: small point for clarity SOFA and qSOFA are largely worthless in the ED and derived from a large pool of icu patients. Alot of these studies lack generalization to the ED. Take the France central line trial for example (3site). Taken as is, I appreciate the sentiment, and the drive to identify this stuff early, but then you get the upcoming recommendations from the 3rd surviving sepsis campaign, and it's then taken as gospel, adopted by CMS and now we are held to an unreasonable standard (30cc/kg bolus, chf be damned for example). No real point to this, just illustrates the carousel we are all on",0

Example: Crew instructions are that if I expire in mid-race, stuff by dead butt in a sailbag, use me for ballast, and finish the race.

Even if I do a small shot. It's bad for your heart to race that fast because 1st it's a muscle, so it's kind of like it's doing thousands of push ups which causes it to get larger -- cardiomyopathy. Which is not a good thing, it can lead to sudden death and congestive heart failure. Also when your heart beats that fast it's not get sufficient blood to many areas of the body including your heart which causes cardiac ischemia (damage to heart due to lack of oxygen) and a heart attack (total death of heart tissue) -- you may have a heart attack and not know it. I swear I've had two. Please don't do what I did, but I didn't go to the hospital because I was afraid on how I would be treated. Being a nurse myself, I know how some nurses and doctors treat people like that. However, when I OD'd on heroin the nurse couldn't have been sweeter. But I wasn't an asshole either and was polite as possible. In the end, whether or not how they treat you, they'll save your damn life. It also can cause heart arrhythmia like frequent PVCs which can be benign (harmless) or they could lead to more dangerous things. It can cause afiberation -- where the atrium of the heart doesn't contract properly, but kind of quivers causing blood stasis in the atrium, and when blood just sits around and doesn't move it clots, it will eventually be ejected and if there is a clot it can be thrown into your lungs or brain causing a pulmonary emoblism or stroke, and it can also cause vfib where the ventricular valve quivers and doesn't contract -- that's the most deadly. If you're not ejecting blood then you will die. When someone goes into vfib they those conciousness pretty fast and in the hospital, even if their heart still has electrical activity like it does in vfib it's consider a code. That's when we'll do compression and shocks. And unlike the movies, if your heart is completely flatlined, no electrical activity, you cannot shock the person because it is useless. It won't convert the deadly heart rhythm back into normal sinus. Anyways, not trying to scare, sometimes I wish I didn't go to college and study biology and nursing and never worked in critical care. I think I make myself freak out too much because of the things I've learned and seen. Just be very careful with shooting up, small doses if you have to and not doing it multiple hours in a day saturating your body with meth. Same goes with smoking and everything other ROA. I still use, so I'm not coming on here to convince people to quit, but everyone, in my opinion, needs to be informed. And a heart rate over 200 is deadly and you should immediately go the ER or call an ambulance and not worry about what anyone thinks. It's better that someone save your life and think of you as a meth head than to die.",1

The teenager was staying with her family at the makeshift migrant camp at former Athens airport at Elliniko. The young female was taken to the hospital on April 14 for suffering abdominal pain due to gastroenteritis. Doctors decided to keep her in the hospital for treatment. However, the parents of the 17-year-old chose to take her back with them to the camp. During the day, however, her condition deteriorated and she was transferred back to the hospital where she was intubated. According to her parents, the young woman had suffered from rheumatoid fever in Afghanistan. Doctors said this had caused severe heart failure, leading to four cardiac arrests while she was in the Intensive Care Unit. The cause of death is not known, as her parents refused an autopsy. Authorities worry about epidemics at Elliniko makeshift migrant camp According to Greek authorities, the sanitary conditions at the old Athens airport are dangerous for the approximately 4,000 refugees and migrants who stay there. However, no steps have been taken for the improvement of the living conditions of refugees as the pertinent state agencies try to transfer all refugees and migrants who camp there to official hospitality centers. The coordinating committee for the refugee crisis said that on Tuesday there were 54,062 registered migrants and refugees in Greek territory, with 7,515 currently on eastern Aegean islands. On Wednesday morning, a total of 150 migrant arrivals were recorded on the islands of Lesbos and Chios.",0

However, oral anticoagulation vitamin K antagonist therapy, frequently used in these patients, is problematic in assessing and/or confirming a diagnosis of primary aPL syndrome (pAPS), suggesting use of alternative strategies. For this reason, and by analogy with other autoimmune diseases, a flow cytometer approach testing peripheral T cell subsets (CD3, CD4, and CD8), B cell subsets (B1, transitional, naive, and memory), and NK cells can be proposed. As an example and to validate the concept, pAPS patients selected from the monocentric VTE case?control EDITH's cohort were selected during their follow-up. As suspected and in contrast to non-APS VTE patients, other autoimmune diseases, and controls, pAPS VTE patients displayed specific lymphocyte disturbances. Quantitative and qualitative modifications were related to total CD4+ T cell reduction, a lower CD4/CD8 ratio, and disturbance in B cell homeostasis with increased proportions of B1 cells, transitional B cells (CD24++CD38++), and naive B cells (IgD+CD27?), while memory B cells (IgD+CD27+ and IgD?CD27+) were reduced. Interestingly, the absolute number of CD4+ T cells positively correlated with IgG anti-cardiolipin Ab levels. Altogether, disturbances of T and B cell homeostasis characterized pAPS VTE patients during their follow-up. This suggests a means of profiling that could be used in addition to existing criteria to characterize them. from Allergy and Immunology via xlomafota13 on Inoreader http://ift.tt/28Yx5Fr",0

Nagler, On december 4th 2015 extreme tinnitus entered my life. I'm a 47 year old mother of three beautiful teenage children. I've had heart surgery in 2015 and was put on two anti arithmetic drugs (Flecainide and Verapamil). After 5,5 weeks of taking the drugs my mild tinnitus turned into a high pitch scream and steam kettle that moved through my head, throat and ears. After a while I developed hyperacusis. I would hear all sounds distorted and painful. I was nauseated all of the time. T+H turned me from a independent woman and loving mother into a totally depressed wreck. I couldn't function in any way anymore and thought my life was over. This in turn caused me to panic even more because my father committed suicide when I was 17 years old. I know the deep pain of children that are left behind by a parent. A psychiatrist put me on Remeron 30 mg. He also prescribed Xanax 2 x 0,5mg a day. The Xanax took away the hyperacusis and the nausea and made the tinnitus more focused in one spot instead of moving around my head, ears and throat. The Remeron makes me sleep. Its six month later now. I've managed to get down to 1 x 0,5 mg Xanax and am still taking the Remeron. I'm doing a little better though the nausea, fear and depression are still there. I'm still not working or doing many household tours. Every day is a struggle. I have a very loving supportive husband, we've been together since high school. He helps in any way he can. My children haven't seen there mother in this way ever, nor as he. I've been reading succes stories about tinnitus and read your story and information on your site. I've been holding on to hope that some day I will be able to live a normal life again because of these stories. I have to learn to live with this, but don't know how. Unfortunately the latest appointment with my cardiologist has shown that my mitral valve is not functioning properly. I need drugs to prevent heart failure. An ace inhibitor. I am scared to take these drugs because of my experience with the anti arithmetics (I was allowed to discontinue use of these drugs 2,5 weeks after T started). The need for new cardiac drugs is creating extra stress. Im back to panic and nausea all day. Maybe because the Xanax is not as potent anymore. I'm very tired from the drugs and unfortunately still have deep depressive moments. I don't know what to do. I'm scared. I've read your story and part where you tell how you would put your head on the lap of your 80 year old mother made me cry, as I did exactly the same. Desperately looking for some form of comfort (my mother is 79). There is no TRT here in the Netherlands. I've been evaluated by an ENT and am told I have mild hearing loss (13000 hz and up). Please can you give me some advice? Hartje5 (I'm from northern Europe so sorry for any language mistakes I've made).",1

As a supplement, it seems to help with several conditions, from migraines to inflammation. Why do people take arginine? Because it relaxes blood vessels, arginine might have cardiovascular benefits for some people. Studies show that it might ease the symptoms of angina and peripheral arterial disease. It seems to boost the health of people with heart failure. It might also help witherectile dysfunction, but mostly when combined with other supplements such as yohimbine. Some studies have shown an immune-boosting effect. Arginine combats the symptoms of wasting caused by HIV. It seems to improve the symptoms of kidney inflammation and assists kidney function after a transplant. Studies show arginine might ease migraines, improve blood pressure, lessen recovery time after surgery, and speed up wound healing. Not all studies have been positive. Arginine does not seem to help with heart attackrecovery, preeclampsia, or exercise tolerance in people with heart failure. It seems to worsen asthma. Arginine has been studied as a treatment for many more conditions. They includedementia, hypertension, cancer, male infertility, diabetes, and obesity. But the results have been inconclusive. More research needs to be done. Arginine has become a popular supplement in the U.S. However, most people seem to have enough arginine in their bodies already. They might not get much benefit fromsupplements. How much arginine should you take? There is no standard dose of arginine. Studies have used different amounts for different conditions. One common dosage is 2 to 3 grams three times a day, although lower and higher doses have also been studied. The safety of long-term arginine supplement use is not clear. Ask your doctor for advice. In some cases, doctors recommend supplemental arginine. People with protein malnutrition, burns, infections, rapid growth, and other conditions might need supplemental arginine. Can you get arginine naturally from foods? Many foods are natural sources of low levels of arginine. They include nuts (like walnuts, hazelnuts, pecans, peanuts, almonds, cashews, and Brazil nuts), seeds (like sesame and sunflower), oats, corn, cereals, buckwheat, brown rice, dairy products, meat, chicken, and chocolate.""",0

VAD has been observed in LFN-exposed professionals, such as, aircraft technicians, commercial and military pilots and cabin crewmembers, ship machinists, restaurant workers, and disk-jockeys. VAD has also been observed in several populations exposed to environmental LFN. This report summarizes what is known to date on VAD, LFN?induced pathology, and related issues. In 1987, the first autopsy of a deceased VAD patient was performed. The extent of LFN?induced damage was overwhelming, and the information obtained is, still today, guiding many of the associated and ongoing research projects. In 1992, LFN-exposed animal models began to be studied in order to gain a deeper knowledge of how tissues respond to this acoustic stressor. In both human and animal models, LFN exposure causes thickening of cardiovascular structures. Indeed, pericardial thickening with no inflammatory process, and in the absence of diastolic dysfunction, is the hallmark of VAD. Depressions, increased irritability and aggressiveness, a tendency for isolation, and decreased cognitive skills are all part of the clinical picture of VAD. LFN is a demonstrated genotoxic agent, inducing an increased frequency of sister chromatid exchanges in both human and animal models. The occurrence of malignancies among LFN-exposed humans, and of metaplastic and displastic appearances in LFN-exposed animals, clearly corroborates the mutagenic outcome of LFN exposure. The inadequacy of currently established legislation regarding noise assessments is a powerful hindrance to scientific advancement. VAD can never be fully recognized as an occupational and environmental pathology unless the agent of disease - LFN - is acknowledged and properly evaluated. The worldwide suffering of LFN-exposed individuals is staggering and it is unethical to maintain this status quo. Infrasounds. Last Edited by Hila Witkutin on 04/24/2016 02:24 PM",0

Their innovative technique boosts the growth of a protein-rich bean by improving the way it absorbs nutrients, while reducing the need for fertilizer. Birds of prey constrained in the beak evolution race Posted: 29 Apr 2016 07:55 AM PDT How birds' beaks evolved characteristic shapes to eat different food is a classic example of evolution by natural selection. However, new research found this does not apply to all species, and that raptors in particular have not enjoyed this evolutionary flexibility. Detecting minute nano amounts in environmental samples Posted: 29 Apr 2016 07:00 AM PDT It is still unclear what the impact is on humans, animals and plants of synthetic nanomaterials released into the environment or used in products. It's very difficult to detect these nanomaterials in the environment since the concentrations are so low and the particles so small. Now scientists have developed a method that is capable of identifying even minute amounts of nanomaterials in environmental samples. A spoonful of sugar? Swapping sugary drinks for water and dairy seems the best medicine Posted: 29 Apr 2016 07:00 AM PDT New research may have an impact on the sugar tax debate. The research team observed overall changes in dietary patterns in overweight children, including a decrease in consumption of sugary drinks, when additional water or milk is added to their diet. Glucose as a new energy source for pacemakers Posted: 29 Apr 2016 06:58 AM PDT Researchers are working on the creation of a bio-battery that uses blood glucose to produce energy. Such a battery would cut down on the number of surgical interventions a pacemaker user must undergo. Trauma in a bee: Entomologists shed light on bizarre mating mechanisms of native twisted-winged parasites Posted: 29 Apr 2016 06:50 AM PDT Twisted-winged parasites of the species Stylops ovinae reproduce using so-called traumatic insemination. To inseminate the eggs, the males injure the endoparasitic females with their hook-shaped penis and inject the seminal fluid directly into their body cavity. Spintronics: Spin currents in topological insulators controlled Posted: 29 Apr 2016 06:50 AM PDT Scientists have shown how spin-polarized currents can be initiated in a controlled manner within samples of topological insulator material. In addition, they were able to manipulate the orientation of the spins of these currents. Chances are you don?t remember what you just retweeted Posted: 29 Apr 2016 06:50 AM PDT Research finds retweeting or otherwise sharing information creates a 'cognitive overload' that interferes with learning and retaining what you've just seen. Worse yet, that overload can spill over and diminish performance in the real world. Cooling graphene-based film close to pilot-scale production Posted: 29 Apr 2016 06:50 AM PDT Heat dissipation in electronics and optoelectronics is a severe bottleneck in the further development of systems in these fields.

Gene therapy halts pulmonary hypertension progression in large animal pre-clinical study Posted: 28 Apr 2016 02:32 PM PDT Scientists have used a novel gene therapy to halt the progression of pulmonary hypertension, a form of high blood pressure in the lung blood vessels that is linked to heart failure. HPV vaccination expected to reduce cancer in all races, may not eliminate all disparities Posted: 28 Apr 2016 02:32 PM PDT Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers occur more frequently among Hispanics, blacks, American-Indians, and Alaska Natives than among whites. A new study finds that HPV vaccination is expected to reduce the cancer burden across all racial/ethnic groups. However, some disparities in cancer burden may persist and widen in the years to come if their causes, such as lack of access to diagnoses and treatment, aren't addressed. Mental health evaluations improved Posted: 28 Apr 2016 12:23 PM PDT A new assessment tool has been developed to gauge the risk that someone with a mental illness will commit a crime. It could also speed up long-delayed competency evaluations for people awaiting trial. Researchers discover potential treatment for sepsis and other responses to infection Posted: 28 Apr 2016 12:23 PM PDT Ebola and other dangerous microbes often produce these inflammatory responses. Researchers say that tiny doses of a cancer drug may stop the raging, uncontrollable immune response to infection that leads to sepsis and kills up to 500,000 people a year in the US. The new drug treatment may also benefit millions of people worldwide who are affected by infections and pandemics. Rare disease gene has a key role in chronic hepatitis C infection Posted: 28 Apr 2016 12:18 PM PDT Hepatitis C virus hijacks the host's fat metabolism for its own survival, growth, and transport in the human body. A study identifies a host gene involved in the formation of HCV virus particles and helps explain why humans with a rare mutation in the gene have problems with their fat metabolism. Genes that influence dizygotic twinning and fertility Posted: 28 Apr 2016 10:21 AM PDT Medical researchers have obtained a breakthrough in identifying genes that increase the chance for mothers to have dizygotic twins.

Only my wife, parents and grandparents know of this. The primary reason being that it was such a horrible thing to have happened to a 9 year old boy that even thinking about it slightly would trigger a full blown paralyzing panic attack for over 20 years. It is the single most traumatic event in my life. I am sharing this as a form of self therapy. I speak from personal experience that the way strong trauma affects people can have long lasting and completely unexpected effects. I was born with a terminal heart and lung condition. I was the third person ever able to be treated for it and the first to ever survive. I have had five open heart surgeries and more other invasive tests/procedures done than I could ever even try to count. And while part of the truama is that I have woken up during a couple of those surgeries the event that I am going to share with you eclipses even that horror by several magnitudes. The point is I was in the hospital a lot as a child and not for small routine things. By the time I was 7 or 8 I pretty much had the floor plan of the hospital memorized. I knew where I was and how to get anywhere else on any of the 20 or so floors of the building. I was going in for another lifesaving operation when I was 9 years old is when it happened. The nurses gave me some medication to ""relax"" in my hospital room and put me in a gurney. This was normal for my life and I was comfortable and happy as you could be in that situation all while I was slowly losing motor control. Then we went down a long corridor to some part of the hospital I had never seen before. Many years later I learned that we actually crossed a bridge to the next door building which was the other half of the hospital complex, but I did not know that at this time. I was suddenly thrust into the unknown in a rapidly increasing helpless state. As we travel down strange corridors filled with hospital staff I actually did not know my anxiety continued to grow. By the time we reached our destination I was completely incapable of movement or speech but still completely conscious and clear thinking. All of my senses were working at 110% but there was no way to signal my distress. We were in a high end 1980's operating room that was painted dark blue. To this day I get apprehensive at the sight of that color and flee from any room that mimics it as soon as is reasonably possible. I have termed the entire experience ""The Blue Room"" as a way to talk about it. If you need a visual aid it looked very much like this, but I am unable to search for a higher quality representative for reasons that should be obvious. http://blog.mediligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/operating-room.jpg Once in the operating room I was transferred to the operating table and left there while the doctors and staff prepared for what they were going to do to me. Right in front of me in plain sight. I laid there surrounded by terrifying machines whose functions I could not comprehend as they got out and filled a tray directly in front of me with scalpels, forceps, bone saws, needles, tubing, and anything else they required. I could see and hear everything clearly. Including how they were discussing the very low probability that I would even survive this operation. At this point I am screaming and crying as loud as I can in my head ""I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this. This isn't right. I don't want to do this."" No sound or movement was possible or noticeable to those around me. I had been rendered silent by the ""relaxing"" drink. After what I am certain was several minutes of this I lost my vision. Everything went black but I was still conscious for at least another couple of minutes. My last thought was me crying ""I don't want to do this."" And then I died. I am not saying that for dramatic effect. That was the only way my therapists 20 years later could help me come to terms with it. It took us over a dozen 1-2 hour long sessions just for me to even get to the point that I could think about the entire incident without being a crying mess for often several hours. Obviously I survived and even thrived to a certain degree as I am now 34 years old. But this was such a bad time that I actually blocked it from my memory for those 3 years until after the second incident. The Blue Room event was directly related to another similar incident nearly 3 years later when I was 11. I was again going to have another operation and this time it was in a similar operating room but this time it was painted brown. I call this one ""The Brown Room"" to differentiate the place and event enough to be able to discuss it. Keep in mind by 11 years old I was literally an emaciated 90 pound weakling in heart failure who could not walk up several flights of stairs without resting. I was placed on the metal operating table only this time I had not been rendered helpless by being given something to ""relax"". My mother was also in the operating room this time as well before the staff prepared. Like I said, they knew us and she was an RN anyway. I was perfectly fine for at least a few minutes when I suddenly started to feel fear. I did not know what was happening or why I felt this way but it continued to grow in strength quickly with no external source I could discern. My mother first noticed and tried to calm me but her words had no effect. Then an orderly came in and decided to try and restrain me. That was a mistake. I exploded. All these years later I still remember having one crystal clear realization at that moment. I am not helpless this time, I can fight! At the time I did not even understand what ""this time"" meant. But I fought and I fought viciously. My sole consuming desire was to get out of that room and kill anything that got in my way including my own mother. I am certain that I caused at least some minor injuries to the orderly and his 4 friends who helped him restrain me until they were able to get me sedated. All of them were bigger men than I am today. After that operation I remembered the first incident. But the two events were linked in my mind in some way I could not understand, I could not think of one without thinking of the other and the terror just fed on itself until it burned itself out. Anything could trigger it, but seeing that dark blue color or certain parts of a hospital always did. I could be having panic attacks that lasted hours because of this. It has effected me today. I cannot be bound or rendered incapable of movement. And I cannot be awake when I enter an operating room. If such things happen then I immediately go into the kind of reaction as in the Brown Room. The only thing I will be concerned with is getting free and I will kill anything or anyone in my way regardless of who they are. It is automatic, I cannot control it until I get free of the situation and can calm down. The good news is that in a way the Brown Room was an empowering event. I learned that if something bad ever happened or if I was ever attacked I could actually stand my ground and if not win at least give as good as I got regardless of being disabled or not. Jesus Christ that was a bitch to write! I'm going to go cuddle up with my kitty and comfort food.",1

Chronic alcohol use can increase the workload of the heart which can lead to arrhythmia's (irregular heart beat), inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), increased cholesterol, and hypertension. Other problems are noted with blood clotting and an increased workload of the heart that is associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Binge drinkers are not immune from cardiac problems. A syndrome known as ""holiday heart"" has been found in some that binge drink. This is characterized by a severe, irregular heartbeat, which is known as atrial fibrillation. Holiday heart got its name as it frequently occurs around the holidays, a time when many people overindulge in alcohol consumption. Hypertension or high blood pressure is a known risk factor in cardiovascular problems. Hypertension has been seen in those who tend to abuse alcohol. It is believed that this hypertension may be related to magnesium deficiency or hormonal irregularities. Hypertension is also a risk factor in cerebral vascular accidents (CVA) which are also known as strokes. Strokes can occur because of impairment of blood flow or by bleeding in the brain through hemorrhaging (bleeding) from a blood vessel. The Negative Effects of Alcohol on the Heart Those who regularly drink an excessive amount of alcohol risk damaging their cardiovascular system. It is believed that as much as 2 percent of the cases of coronary heart disease may relate to excessive drinking. These are some of the negative effects of alcohol on the heart: * Long-term abuse of alcohol can cause [alcoholic cardiomyopathy]. This is where the alcohol has a toxic affect on the heart muscle, causing it to become damaged. In some cases, this damage will lead to heart failure and death. * Excessive alcohol intake can cause high blood pressure (hypertension), and this puts extra strain on...",0

For many decades now, heart-related problems have been among the top killers of human life. Worldwide, thousands of people die of heart problems every day [1]. Billions have been spent on treatments and research but the mortality rate for heart disease is similar to that of cancer. Overall, half of the patients die within just 4 years, the current standard medication for heart failure is just 3?4 percent more effective than a placebo, and a German study shows the efficiency of newly invented medications has dropped significantly over the last 30 years [2].

Natural Oils and Herbal Remedies for Migraine Victims They obtain as aged as a hundred years or even longer. Adam died at age 930, Noah 950, Abraham a hundred seventy five, Isaac one hundred and eighty, with Methuselah being the oldest character in the bible to die in 969. Several sectors think that longer life span can be related to factors such as meals, environment and lifestyle. A long time ago, most meals were not prepared and had been consumed in the natural state. Naturally, individuals are healthier because of the absence of chemicals and preservatives which can cause a lot of the current day health problems prevalent today. The environment was also free from harmful contaminants brought about by industrialization. And life styles then were simple enough to not cause too much stress and anxiety. But today's contemporary world is definitely far from the olden days where life is just like a breeze of fresh air. And no matter just how much people try to bring back the ways, we are able to only obtain so far. People can go on a diet plan of natural foods, a proper lifestyle of fitness without the vices such as smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and the like. But what about the environment? This really is a different story. People can take part in tree-planting tasks, in campaigns against pollution, recycling solutions, etc . It may minimize the harmful associated with worldwide natural pollution or maybe the green-house effect, but as the world continues to evolve and develop, improvement will still destroy the ecosystem, the atmosphere, as well as its natural resources. The exhaustion of the ozone layer is certainly recognized as a threat to human into the the environment. Global warming caused by the carbon dioxide exhausts from vehicles are also the reason behind a wide range of respiratory illnesses that has caused, directly and indirectly, the deaths of thousands. Although there are very few-people who still live up to more than a hundred years aged, such as Cuban Benito Martinez whom died in 126 upon October 2006, life expectancy has dramatically fallen down to eighty on the typical. The fast-paced way of living brought about by advancements in technology has produced physical, psychological, and mental conditions such as cerebrovascular accident, depression, stress and anxiety disorders. A grown-up Bedwetting Forums Find Out How Others Are Coping Latest studies, however , show that Americans are living longer and healthier nowadays. Reason for this are the technical advancement in medicines such as the new medical screening assessments which can often detect illnesses and possibly serious health problems in their early, treatable phases. Some of these assessments include Blood Pressure Check, Heart problems Screening, Bloodstream Sugar Test. Stress Check Blood pressure pertains to the arterial pressure that takes bloodstream away from the cardiovascular. Blood pressure tends to rise as people age. However , hypertension, also known as hypertonie, is one of the risk factors pertaining to heart stroke, heart episodes, heart failing, arterial aneurysms, and chronic renal failure. It kills the cardiovascular, brain, eye and kidneys. Don't let hypertonie sneak up on you. Get your stress checked by your doctor at least one time a year. Cholesterol Screening Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance the body uses to produce many hormones, vitamin D, as well as the bile stomach acids that assist to digest body fat. But it requires only a small amount of cholesterol in the blood to fulfill these needs. Too much cholesterol in the bloodstream or high cholesterol amounts are a risk factor to get heart disease and stroke. Because of this , it is important to measure the bad cholesterol levels at least once every five years and more frequently if you are at higher risk. Blood Sugar Test Blood Sugars Test decides how well your body can process sugar or blood sugar. It also diagnoses diabetes which could destroy your health, leading to heart disease, kidney failure and blindness when left untreated. Diabetes is a potentially life-threatening condition which can be managed in the event that detected in the early stage. Get a bloodstream sugar test at least once every 3 years. Acquiring these lab tests and physical check ups usually do not guarantee a longer life but it will surely help improve one's health to visit your health care providers in a regular visit. It is tips to practice a healthy and energetic lifestyle to prevent acquiring serious medical conditions which can shorten one's life expectancy.",0

James, Ph.D., Director of the Office of Minority Health at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Romana Hasnain-Wynia, M.S., Ph.D., Program Director for Addressing Disparities at the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) Pursuing Health Equity for the Nation ?Accelerating Health Equity for the Nation? is this year?s theme for National Minority Health Month, which we mark every April as a time to focus on efforts to help all Americans achieve the highest level of health they can. Health equity is a challenging goal given how many factors contribute to optimal health, but it is a goal we can never stop striving to attain. There are numerous barriers minorities and other underserved populations face in accessing the health care and those barriers often lead to disparities in health and healthcare outcomes. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Office of Minority Health and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) are two of the organizations established by the ACA working to address these barriers and accelerate progress toward health equity. The CMS Office of Minority Health is dedicated to increasing understanding and awareness of health disparities among CMS beneficiaries and ensuring that the voices and needs of minority and underserved populations are included in developing, implementing, and evaluating CMS programs and policies. It does this through its ?USA? framework, which has three interconnected elements that together will help lead to health equity ?increasingUnderstanding and awareness of disparities among its beneficiaries; creating and sharingSolutions; and accelerating the implementation of effective Actions. Key activities include strengthening CMS data and using it to create initiatives that organizations can use to reduce disparities, through such specific efforts as the CMS Equity Plan to Improve Quality in Medicare, the Mapping Medicare Disparities Tool, and From Coverage to Care. PCORI?s mandate is to improve the quality and relevance of evidence available to help a range of healthcare stakeholders?including patients, caregivers, clinicians, employers, insurers, and policy makers?make better-informed health decisions. It does this by funding research that compares two or more approaches to care to determine what works best, for whom, under which circumstances, based on the outcomes most important to patients. PCORI?s authorizing legislation directs it to pay particular attention to health disparities and to include members of minority groups in research whenever possible. That?s one reason why Addressing Disparities is one of PCORI?s five National Priorities for Research, which govern how PCORI awards its research dollars. The Addressing Disparities program now includes a substantial portfolio of studies designed to determine how to reduce barriers to effective preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic care, taking into account individual and group preferences, to achieve the best outcomes in each population. Seeking New Approaches Both the CMS Office of Minority Health and PCORI also are concerned with strengthening the healthcare workforce to better serve vulnerable and underserved patient populations. This includes initiatives focusing on how to better make use of lay members of healthcare teams?who are known, for example, as community health workers, patient navigators, and promotores de salud?as links between patients, communities, and the healthcare system. CMS Office of Minority Health is working on how to support, engage, and empower these professionals, while PCORI has funded more than 50 projects that are comparing health outcomes and other aspects of programs that do and don?t include lay members of healthcare teams. One large study involving 30 primary care clinics and almost 1,900 patients compares the effectiveness of a clinic-based standard of care to a collaborative approach that includes community health workers. It asks whether the collaborative approach improves hypertension control for racial and ethnic minorities and other groups that experience disparities in this condition. Delivering Health Information and Services via Telecommunications Telehealth is another area that both CMS and PCORI are exploring as a means to reduce disparities. PCORI is currently funding 26 projects on telehealth, many of which focus on underserved populations. One of these studies compares the effectiveness of a telehealth self-management approach versus traditional in-person care for African-American and Hispanic/Latino patients with chronic heart failure. In the telehealth intervention, a care provider contacts the patient weekly via a video call. The study will measure emergency room use, quality of life, and other outcomes. Another CMS initiative is looking for ways to expand the use of telehealth in rural areas, where health care tends to be less available than elsewhere. Reducing Disparities in Chronic Disease Treatment and Outcomes Both the CMS Office of Minority Health and PCORI have a commitment to reducing disparities in the treatment of a range of illnesses. Among these is asthma, which is more prevalent and severe among African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos than among whites, as are a range of disparities in health outcomes. At PCORI, there are more than a dozen projects addressing racial and ethnic disparities in asthma treatment outcomes. These include eight studies that compare ways to increase patient and clinician adherence to the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines. Project teams include patients, clinicians, insurers, health systems, community clinics and practices, public health departments, and patient and caregiver advocacy organizations. Accelerating Health Equity The CMS Office of Minority Health and PCORI are just two of many organizations working to move our nation further along the path to health equity. However, to achieve that goal, we need more individuals, organizations, and communities to join the effort. We look forward to working with you to make health equity a reality.this placeholder text.",0

Kangaroos populate the plains, Koalas hang in the trees, and Kookaburras flutter through the skies above. While venomous snakes often slither quietly through the reeds, ready to strike at a moment?s notice, it is in Australia?s long and winding rivers where you really have to watch out, as lurking beneath the surface could be the smiling face of a deadly crocodile.  The dangers of crocodiles are well known here, so well known that in earlier times, crocodile hunters would often become celebrities, renowned throughout Australia for their courage and skill.  The most famous of them all was ?Crocodile Harry? ? and curiously, he was a Latvian who hailed from the village of Dundaga in the region of Kurzeme, 124 kilometers from Riga (a distance many Australians would describe as ?close? to Latvia?s capital).  Known primarily for its 13th century medieval castle, the village of Dundaga commemorates Crocodile Harry ? whose Latvian name is Arvids Blumentals ? with a massive two-ton concrete sculpture of one the largest of all living reptiles and terrestrial predators in the world, the most dangerous extant crocodilian to humans ? a saltwater crocodile. It remains an enigma to many baffled visitors of the town. Visitors who may be unaware of the Dundaga?s infamous son,  who was born there in 1925, but emigrated to Australia in 1951.  Depicted with wide glaring eyes, with sharp long teeth housed in a long snouted muzzle,  and in a crouching attack position, this sculpture represents a  formidable and opportunistic hyper carnivorous, ambush predator. It is in memory of all of Dundaga?s strong men. And the strongest was Blumentals ? so reads the plaque attached to the sculpture.  Blumentals was known to a chameleon character, adapting quickly to his new environment ? and the difference between the two environments could hardly be more pronounced. Moving from Latvia?s boreal forests to Australia?s dusty outback could not have been easy. And culturally, the change required for Blumental must have been enormous. Setting off to Australia was a path taken by many Latvians in the years after World War Two, but hunting crocodiles in the outback means that all too often, you?re on your own. Even his name provided difficulties. Arvids was a hard name for Australians to pronounce. So he changed it to Harry.  10,000 crocs  Blumenthals? larger than life adventurous story may seem like a good piece of bush folklore, particularly to Australians. But whether real or just perhaps made up, his exploits have appeared in newspaper articles and magazines across the world.    Numerous documentary films ? they say as many as 30 ? and countless TV features have been made about Blumenthal?s colourful life.   Crocodile Harry allegedly killed a whopping 10,000 crocodiles over a 13-year period while in Australia. Blumenthal also caught ?smaller? crocodiles ? which were  up to two metres in length ? with only his bare hands.  Hollywood star  It has been noted that Blumenthal may have been the prototype to the 1986 Hollywood comedy film ?Crocodile Dundee.? But this gets you into controversial waters, as it has been widely disputed. The film was  set in the Australian Outback, and starred the Australian actor Paul Hogan in the lead role of the weathered Mick Dundee, a crocodile hunter.     Crocodile hunting was banned in Australia in 1968, which saw Blumentals settling in opal town of Coober Pedy, in the state of South Australia. A town considered the opal mining capital of the world.  In Coober Pedy (an anglicised version of the Aboriginal words ?kupa piti,? meaning ?white man in a hole?)  the former Latvian Crocodile Hunter  tried his hand at opal mining, and was to rapidly achieve legendary status with his exploits.  It was in Coober Pedy that he excavated his extravagant and bizarre underground dugout (a home typical of Coober Pedy), which was to become one of the town?s most prominent and popular tourist attractions. It was proposed for heritage listing in 2007.  Known as  the Crocodile Nest, Blumenthals? dugout, constructed in an underground cave carved out of a hillside, is situated 5 kilometres from the town?s centre near the Four Mile Opal Field.   Blumentals directed all his creative energy into his  dugout, which featured tribal graffiti  covered walls, festooned with women?s under garments, and signatures of over 1,000 virgins scrawled on the walls by female visitors who stayed in his dugout.  It is also adorned with weird sculptures created by Blumentals? own hands. His clutter filled residence was featured in the 1985 Australian post-apocalyptic action adventure film Mad Max 3 ? ?Beyond Thunderdome,? which starred Mel Gibson, and Tina Turner.  Near the entrance of the dugout, the film crew upon concluding filming erected a sculpture which they named ?The Orchestra.?  When the wind blows the sculpture reverberates in the stillness of the desert in a performance of  eclectic sounds.  The death certificate records Von Blumentals Arvids (Croc Harry) death on Oct. 13, 2006. He was to later declare himself a Latvian Baron, forced to leave Latvia at the conclusion of  the Second World War.  Buried in plot 234 of Cobber Pedy?s Boot Hill Cemetery. Blumentals was 81 years of age when he died of heart failure.  A simple cross with the words Crocodile Harry is written on his grave.""",0

FORUMS,medhelp.org,http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/2905240,7/16/2016,8:00:00,,,"About the hearts ability to repair itself I have often wondered about a diseased hearts ability to repair itself because I have experienced this on a couple of occasions. I am a 62 year autistic, socially avoidant male who has made poor life decisions and is currently facing heart failure. But the heart can recover from periods of extreme stress, when palpitations and fatigue knock you down. Prolonged rest does the trick, or did for me. Twice I cured a fast, irregular heartbeat that almost brought me to my knees with prolonged rest. But as CHD progresses to heart failure, the heart can no longer repair itself. Just curious as to what the repair mechanisms are at work here. Does the coronary artery cleanse itself or somehow close off problem areas, reroute blood, rebuild the muscle now that is shouldering the burden of pumping now. What did my heart do to eliminate my irregular heart beat on two occasions. The term heart failure implies that such repair is longer possible. Again, what exactly is going on internally. I suppose I can just google up more info, but I'm curious about how it is determined that indeed your heart is now failing as opposed to being diseased, and exactly what changes have occurred in the heart . What can the heart self repair, how does it do it, and what can it not repair? Thanks, Aldri49",1

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. According to current European classification, cardiomyopathies are defined as myocardial disorders that cannot be explained by coronary artery disease or abnormal loading conditions including valvular and congenital diseases. Six specific morphological and functional phenotypes are distinguished: hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy together with two unclassified subtypes: Tako-tsubo and left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathies. In almost all of these phenotypes, inherited forms may be found; moreover, in some of them?for example, in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?a genetic origin is even a rule. Therefore, genetic counseling shall be an integral part of the state-of-the-art care of patients with heart muscle disorders. The affected individuals together with their relatives have to be informed about the genetic basis of their disease and the potential risk for other family members. A detailed cardiac evaluation, including ECG and echocardiography (in some cases also Holter ECG monitoring), of first-degree relatives is necessary with their further regular follow-up. If available, genetic testing shall be discussed with the patients as it may improve their management as well as enable effective preventive genetic testing in other relatives. Because the evaluation of morphology and function of the heart, especially of the left ventricle, is a prerequisite for accurate phenotypic characterization of every myocardial disease, a multimodality imaging approach generally becomes necessary. Echocardiography is still a cornerstone of diagnostic imaging because it is accurate, widely available, safe, and without any contraindications. In recent years, advanced echo modalities gained a clinical role in the follow-up of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy, and global longitudinal strain is recommended in the latest European guidelines. However, the role of cardiac magnetic resonance is increasingly important. Not only is it the current gold standard for morphological and functional assessment of heart chambers, but it has a unique opportunity of noninvasive tissue characterization. Based on evaluation of the presence of myocardial edema, hyperemia, and necrosis using dedicated sequences, cardiac magnetic resonance is capable of diagnosing acute myocarditis with high accuracy. Late gadolinium enhancement technique is widely used to assess the presence and extent of replacement myocardial fibrosis, which appears to be strongly related to the prognosis of affected individuals. Presence of myocardial fibrosis predisposes to increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and progression of left ventricular dysfunction associated with heart failure worsening. One also has to mention the significant contribution of various techniques of nuclear medicine for the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis and transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. It is obvious that increasing knowledge on ethiopathogenesis of various myocardial disorders together with improved diagnostic possibilities shall result in novel therapeutic options. A complex immunohistochemical and PCR analysis of endomyocardial biopsy specimens allows us to characterize in more detail the presence and type of myocardial inflammation as well as the presence of possible causative infectious agents and select better more targeted treatment of acute myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy with administration of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs or antiviral agents. Many therapeutic strategies are currently investigated in the field of transthyretin amyloidosis including stabilizers of transthyretin tetramers and gene therapies aimed at suppression of transthyretin expression. Another important topic is the development of new treatment possibilities that will be able to prevent late sequelae of cytostatic therapy associated with potential cardiotoxic effect. In this special issue we are pleased to introduce several interesting original as well as review articles focused on different topics in the field of myocardial diseases. (i) Two original articles deal with the topic of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. P. Robinson et al. investigated in their experimental study the role of substance P in chemotherapy-associated death of cardiomyocytes and chemoresistance and nicely showed that aprepitant, a substance P receptor antagonist, is able to decrease doxorubicin induced death of cardiomyocytes as well as to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to this drug. A. F. Yu et al. evaluated the use of 2D speckle tracking echocardiography in early diagnosis of cardiotoxicity associated with anthracyclines and radiation therapy. Their results confirm that this novel imaging modality is more sensitive in detecting left ventricular systolic dysfunction than traditional indices of ventricular function such as ejection fraction and thus can be used for long-term cardiac surveillance of adult cancer survivors. (ii) Three articles review several aspects of inflammation/infection related myocardial diseases. J. Krejci et al. largely summarize our current knowledge on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of inflammatory cardiomyopathy with emphasis on accurate evaluation of endomyocardial biopsy samples, which is prerequisite for the appropriate choice of subsequent treatment options. P. Kuchynka et al. nicely overview a difficult topic of eosinophilic myocarditis, a rare disorder necessitating quite rapid diagnosis, so early administration of immunosuppressive therapy that may improve the poor prognosis of affected individuals can be initiated. In the last article, R. H. Lumsden and G. S. Bloomfield present a brilliant review on HIV-associated cardiomyopathy which currently represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in this now chronic disease. The authors clearly demonstrate that there is a significant need to design clear guidelines for screening protocols and diagnostic criteria for HIV-related myocardial disease. (iii) Several issues related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are discussed in three articles. R. Pudil et al. aimed to investigate the significance of vascular endothelial growth factor in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and their results show that increased levels of this substance are associated with structural and functional parameters in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy suggesting the possibility of its use for a more accurate diagnosis. L. K. Williams et al. focused on left atrial function in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Using magnetic resonance velocity vector imaging, they convincingly demonstrate a negative impact of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction on left atrial size and function that significantly improves after septal myectomy. Finally, P. P. Dimitrow and R. Rajtar-Salwa review several aspects related to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with emphasis on invasive as well as noninvasive treatment possibilities. If the readers will find the presented articles informative and stimulating their interest in myocardial disorders, the purpose of this special issue will be completely fulfilled. Tomas Palecek",0

The Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) EpiCast Report provides an overview of the risk factors, comorbidities, and global trends for RSV infection in the seven major markets (7MM) (US, France , Germany , Italy , Spain , UK, and Japan ). It includes a 10-year epidemiological forecast of the diagnosed incident cases and diagnosed prevalent cases of PAH, segmented by sex, and age (in 10-year increments beginning at 0 years and ending at =85 years in these markets and is written and developed by Masters- and PhD-level epidemiologists. Complete report on Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Market Research to 2024 with 19 market data tables and 16 figures, spread across 72 pages is available at http://www.reportsnreports.com/reports/470866-epicast-report-pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-epidemiology-forecast-to-2024.html . Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a rare and severe condition characterized by vascular proliferation and remodeling of the small pulmonary arteries. This results in progressively increasing pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure. The disease typically results in right-sided heart failure and premature death. PAH can be idiopathic, heritable, or associated with different conditions such as connective tissue disease (CTD), congenital heart disease (CHD), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and exposure to toxins or drugs. PAH occurs twice as frequently in women as in men. Epidemiologists forecast an increase in the diagnosed incident cases of PAH in the 7MM, from 1,769 diagnosed incident cases in 2014 to 1,838 diagnosed incident cases in 2024, with an Annual Growth Rate (AGR) of 0.39% during the forecast period. In 2024, the US will have the highest number of diagnosed incident cases of PAH in the 7MM, with 677 diagnosed incident cases, whereas the UK will have the lowest number of diagnosed incident cases of PAH, with 74 diagnosed incident cases. Similarly, the diagnosed prevalent cases of PAH in the 7MM are expected to increase from 9,926 diagnosed prevalent cases in 2014 to 10,285 diagnosed prevalent cases in 2024, with an AGR of 0.36% during the forecast period. In 2024, the US will have the highest number of diagnosed prevalent cases of PAH in the 7MM, with 4,325 diagnosed prevalent cases, whereas the UK will have the lowest number of diagnosed prevalent cases of PAH, with 443 diagnosed prevalent cases. Order a copy of this report @ http://www.reportsnreports.com/Purchase.aspx?name=470866 . Epidemiological forecast for the diagnosed incident and the diagnosed prevalent cases of PAH in the 7MM is supported by age- and sex-specific data. The forecast methodology was kept consistent across the 7MM to allow for a meaningful comparison of the projected diagnosed incident cases and diagnosed prevalent cases of PAH across the markets. Additionally, GlobalData epidemiologists provided the diagnosed prevalent cases of PAH in each of the 7MM, segmented by the NYHA functional class I-IV, which is an important factor for predicting the prognosis, as well as the need for various clinical and treatment modalities specific to the functional classes, for PAH. GlobalData epidemiologists also provide an additional forecast for the diagnosed incident and diagnosed prevalent cases of PAH, adjusted for the underestimation of registry based forecast. These two different types of forecast strengthen the analysis, and present a comparative assessment of the extent of underestimation when using registry based data, which can be evaluated to provide better insights on the burden of the condition.

She's picking and choosing what she wants reviewed. Received a notice that she was going to take until JULY 23rd to make a determination on my claim. It was denied on April 19th. They get in no hurry to do the right thing. Let me give you a few more examples of what a liar she is and the scam this company is running. My BP on April 18th in the Kidney Specialist's office was 138/95. Her and Danny boy claim it was 130/70. But he claimed you don't have hypertension until you have a sustained elevated BP of 160/100. I was diagnosed in 2012 with Class II heart failure. I told this to the nurse at the Cariologist's office, she thinks they'll lost their minds. In their notes it has chest tightness. But the child prodigy doesn't see that as a problem. She claims I only have a UTI. But Paul Harvey's page 2 and the rest of the story is my white blood cell count, at the last lab work, was +5000, and blood in the urine. The Dr. said my kidneys, liver, and bladder needed to be evaluated. Kidney disease runs in my family, one parent and a sibling have been afflicted with it. But this unqualified, inexperienced genius doesn't think I need care. Beware, key pieces of information get removed. I have her notice and reports from the Cardiologist and Kidney Specialist sitting directly in front of me. That's not counting the notes from the Primary Care Physician, BP in their office was 145/101. I should know, I was sitting right there.""",1

That there is no such thing as an 'ideal' body, or 'ideal body image' - and to promote - with public money - yet more of the tsunami of images designed to makes girls and women feel inadequate is the wrong way to promote healthy lifestyles. There may not be an ideal body image (of course everyones bodies are different), but there are measures for a healthy body. While studies have indicated that having slightly more subcutaneous fat with a much healthier diet is *better* than someone who is skinny with an awful diet (e.g. junk food all the time). You can't compare people like the 2 women in the picture to moderately overweight people and claim they are ""as unhealthy"". It's just factually incorrect when just having abdominal fat is linked with so many life-degrading diseases including heart disease (which, if unchecked can lead to heart failure), diabetes, retinopathy, and a slew of other awful ailments. Overweight people do tend to have higher LDL (bad) cholesterol. Just recently, a paper came out linking higher LDL cholesterol to tumor growth (and suggests that higher LDL can result in increased risk for cancer as well).

For years, that?s been enough to steer people with certain heart conditions away from coffee. But as it turns out, there's little evidence that a caffeine habit could send us into cardiac arrest. That's according to Dr. Greg Marcus, a professor at the University of California-San Francisco and this week's guest on the Inquiring Minds podcast. Marcus specializes in the treatment of arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats?the fast, sluggish, or off-kilter rhythms that can trigger sudden cardiac arrest, an unexpected loss of heart function. The condition is different from a heart attack, which is caused by blockages to blood vessels leading to the heart, and it has seen comparatively little progress in treatment and prevention, Marcus says. In the United States, sudden cardiac arrest kills 325,000 adults each year. ` Last year, Marcus' research team looked into the relationship between caffeine and a type of arrhythmia called early beats, which can be a risk factor for developing heart failure. You can think of this condition as individual heart cells gone rogue. ""If you take a heart cell out of the heart, put it in a petri dish, and keep it alive, it will beat on its own,"" Marcus tells co-host Kishore Hari. Sometimes those cells will jump the gun, beating a little earlier than the rest of the heart. ""There's this conventional wisdom that more caffeine leads to these early beats,"" Marcus says. To find out if that's really the case, his the team monitored heart rhythms along with consumption of common caffeine fixes such as tea, coffee, and chocolate. What they discovered might surprise you. ""We could find no evidence of a relationship,"" says Marcus. The results were published in the Journal of the American Heart Association. Still, Marcus cautions that the heart risks of caffeine may depend on the individual and that more work needs to be done to unpack the role of a patient's unique genetics and environmental exposures. This ties into a broader need for more precision medicine, he says?highly personalized treatments that take those specific factors into account. ""The hope is that with modern techniques to sequence genes as well as to potentially monitor activity using technology, maybe we can really get down to that level,"" he says. Cue Health eHeart, a pioneering Big Data approach to develop strategies to prevent and treat all aspects of heart disease. The goal of the project is to use personal technology to free large-scale clinical research from its traditional home in brick-and-mortar hospitals, where researchers capture a controlled, artificial snapshot of participants' health and behaviors. By gathering information from online surveys and personal gadgets (anything from smartphones to Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuffs), Marcus' team at UCSF is able to study a continuous stream of health data as participants go about their daily activities. ""That's what I like to call real-time, real-life data,"" he says. Participants are given the option to get involved in a variety of studies depending on their backgrounds and the devices they use. Owners of a smart watch, for example, might be asked to opt into an ongoing study on atrial fibrillation?an irregular beat in the heart's upper chambers that's an important risk factor for stroke. The study attempts to develop a more nuanced understanding of what triggers the condition, making use of the watch's heart rate monitor to interlace rhythmic data with other instantaneous measures of health and physical activity. While the Health eHeart project aims to unpack the individualized factors that carry risk for heart disease, Marcus also hopes it will play a more foundational role for further research?""separating the wheat from the chaff,"" as he puts it, by helping to figure out whether wearable devices are as beneficial to public health research as their makers chalk them up to be. Fitbit and the Apple Watch are examples, he says, of devices with savvy health and fitness marketing but still-untested claims: ""Is it useful for health? We make that assumption, but how valid is it? And if it is valid, what is the best way to use it?"" UCSF hopes to enroll 1 million people in Health eHeart. If you want to take part in this ambitious study, you can sign up for the special Inquiring Minds Health eHeart group. Anyone over 18 years old is eligible, including those who are completely healthy, have heart disease, or are patients with cardiovascular conditions that we don't yet know how to treat. Participation requires a few hours over the course of the year. (Note: Inquiring Minds co-host Kishore Hari is an academic staff member of UCSF, but he's not affiliated in any way with the Health eHeart study.)

In the United States (U.S.), an estimated 56% of adults have either hypertension (high blood pressure) or prehypertension (slightly elevated blood pressure). Increased sodium intake can increase your risk of developing hypertension, which can lead to heart attacks, heart failure, stroke, kidney disease, and blindness. To prevent or manage hypertension, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reminds you to use the Nutrition Facts Label to check the sodium content of packaged foods and beverages. Learn more at: http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm315355.htm Look at the Label! Packaged foods and beverages can contain high levels of sodium, whether or not they taste salty ? so before purchasing, check the amount of sodium in the products to make informed dietary choices. Sodium content can vary significantly between similar types of foods. Know the Sources of Sodium More than 40% of the sodium consumed by Americans comes from the following 10 types of foods: Watch Sodium When Eating Out, Too! When eating away from home, ask if nutrition information is available. If a restaurant item or meal includes a claim about its nutrient content, such as ""low sodium"" or ""low fat,"" then nutrition information to support that claim is required to be available at the point of purchase. In addition, FDA's Menu Labeling Final Rule will require many chain restaurants (and other places selling restaurant-type food) to provide written information on the nutrient content of standard menu items, including the amount of sodium.

To implement the robotic surgery a doctor just need to send the robot inside the human body by building a probe later your physician can monitor the robotic action through computer and offer instruction into it easily. After the operation continues to be completed successfully the robot is taken off in the body and consequently the surgery can get completed within 10 to 15 minutes of your time. Even though the pure forskolin reviews ideas are blooming in the medicinal field still traditional and natural medicines are been employed by doctors since they are seen to cure diseases easily and helps to steer an issue free life. The very best natural medicine which employed to cure respiratory diseases and heart failures is forskolin belly buster, the medicine was extracted from the roots of coleus plant and it was manufactured as pills, powders and eye drops. It is recognized to reduce multiple diseases in people like obesity, menses pain, skin diseases, allergy, bowel syndrome, devmqky69 problems, urinary infections, reducing cancer cells in body, blood pressure level, chest pain, asthma, insomnia, seizure, accidental thrombus and a lot of other difficulties. The medicine is proved to be a safe one in humans but people who have low hypertension, pregnancy, mother newest born babies, and those that are likely to take surgeries should be very careful within their consumption. Those individuals should consult with your physician priorly and also have Pure Forskolin only when it really has been prescribed from the doctor, thus by a proper medical advice we can avoid many medical negative effects in us. The forskolin is known to lessen the blood pressure levels level within the body however when it was actually taken with some other high blood pressure medicines then our pressure level reaches the minimum and result in many problems. In the event the coleus interacts with medicines that increases blood flow then it will lead to dizziness, headache and giddiness. Some of the medicines which are used for blood circulation are nitro bid, sorbittrate and etc. thus avoid such medicines while consuming coleus or maybe it may lead to many dangerous adverse reactions. So avoid such pills while taking coleus. People should always consult with the doctor for best medicinal advice and also for choosing best medicines, self prescription is not going to work all time and will also also result in many adverse reactions so always go in accordance with the doctor?s advice.",0

Possible cause of my low T.,"Dr diagnosed me with this. 37, white male 5'9'' 220lbs. They think it's the cause of my low T and lack of being able to get my wife pregnant,,, been trying for about a year... I'd like to get back on T shots sometime soon because I feel like dogsh!t, but still want to have a child and for her to have one since she does not have one of her own. My first child with my ex wife was no problem. He's 10 now. It didn't take more than a couple tries and she was knocked up. Also going in for an MRI on my pituitary gland next week. What is Hemochromatosis? Hemochromatosis is an iron disorder in which the body simply loads too much iron. This action is genetic and the excess iron, if left untreated, can damage joints, organs, and eventually be fatal. There are several types of hemochromatosis. Type 1, also called Classic Hemochromatosis (HHC), is a leading cause of iron overload disease. People with HHC (too much iron) absorb extra amounts of iron from the daily diet. The human body cannot rid itself of extra iron. Over time, these excesses build up in major organs such as the heart, liver, pancreas, joints, and pituitary. If the extra iron is not removed, these organs can become diseased. Untreated hemochromatosis can be fatal. Iron is an essential nutrient found in many foods. Iron carries oxygen (in hemoglobin) to all parts of the body. Normally, humans absorb about 8-10% of the iron in foods that they eat. People with hemochromatosis (too much iron) can absorb four times more iron than normal. Undiagnosed and untreated hemochromatosis (too much iron) increases the risk for diseases and conditions such as: Diabetes mellitus Irregular heart beat or heart attack Arthritis (osteoarthritis, osteoporosis) Cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer Gall bladder disease Depression Impotence Infertility Hypothyroidism Hypogonadism Some cancers Mismanaged iron in the brain has been observed in autopsies of people with neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's, early onset Parkinson's, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. Caucasians are the people most at risk for the classic type of hemochromatosis. More than one million Americans have the genes for this type. However, there are other gene combinations that result in hemochromatosis regardless of a person's ethnicity. It is estimated that as much as or more than 16 million Americans have some degree of elevated iron and are at risk for the same diseases that occur in people with the untreated classic type: bone and joint disease, cirrhosis, liver cancer, diabetes, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, infertility, impotence, depression, or premature death due to liver or heart failure.",0

But meat-free Lent is much more than a symbol of religious devotion. It helps reduce the risk of chronic disease, environmental degradation and animal abuse. Dozens of medical reports have linked consumption of animal products with elevated risk of heart failure, stroke, cancer and other killer diseases. A 2007 U.N. report named meat production as the largest source of greenhouse gases and water pollution. Undercover investigations have documented farm animals being beaten, caged, crowded, deprived, mutilated and shocked. Lent offers a superb opportunity to honor Christ's powerful message of compassion and love by adopting a meat-free diet. After all, it's the diet mandated in Genesis I-29 and observed in the Garden of Eden.

The present study showed: high-sensitivity cTn (he-cTn) have early diagnosis and rule out acute myocardial infarction, AMI patients and identify more effectively AMI risk stratification, and other advantages; at the same time increased sensitivity also makes clinical specificity decreased, Tn liter high visibility in non-ACS-borne diseases. 3 Login / Register to see the big rear Figure 3: Tn Tn elevated for other reasons and pulmonary embolism (PE) Tn increased incidence (> 0.1ng / ml): approximately 50% in patients with acute PE. After PE, pulmonary artery pressure increased sharply, causing acute right ventricular dilatation and damage. Compared with AMI, PE rise resulting Tn, lower peak concentration, a relatively short duration. This means that Tn can be used as a prognostic indicator in patients with PE. cTn with heart failure (HF) cTn increased incidence (> 0.1ng / ml) in patients with acute HF was 52% -55%, in patients with chronic stable HF is 15% -23%. cTn elevation mechanism may be associated with HF and myocardial injury during acute decompensated HF, acute heart chamber volume / pressure overload, excessive increase in myocardial wall tension pressure, subendocardial ischemia related. So the significance of cTn for HF is: cTn decline, along with the improvement of cardiac function; cTn increases, often accompanied by a lower ejection fraction, higher HF clinical stage, higher mortality. Therefore, patients with HF elevated cTn poor prognosis. cTn with chronic kidney disease (CKD) TnT increased incidence (> 0.1ng / ml) up to 53% to 70% in dialysis patients asymptomatic. TnT increase may be due to: uremic myopathy caused by re-expression in skeletal muscle TnT isoforms; about 20% of uremic patients, even without ACS performance, there are also special treatment for coronary artery disease myocardial injury, myocardial apoptosis. Studies have shown that in asymptomatic patients with elevated TnI occur in approximately 19%. Therefore, cTnI have chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with the following meaning: TNI is not expressed in the skeletal muscle of patients with urinary poisoning; TNI cardiac specificity higher than TNT; compared with the TNI, TNT is the prediction of CKD patients without ACS adverse events better indicators. Figure 4 Login / Register to see the big rear Figure 4: cTN with CKD and ACS cTn relationship with myocarditis, an article entitled ""Cardiac Troponin T in Patients With Clinically Suspected Myocarditis"" The results show that: ?cTNT determine cause myocarditis sensitive myocardial injury obviously superior to the traditional markers ?cTNT elevated levels have a high predictive value for myocarditis in cTn inspection, observe cTn curve in time for the clinical diagnosis of great help. Conclusion: Tn sensitivity and specificity of myocardial necrosis markers are high, while Tn rises also widespread disease and non-ACS. Follow elevated non-ACS clinical Tn causes, such as acute pulmonary embolism, acute and chronic heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, all causes of myocardial injury (cardioversion, surgery, trauma, etc.), specific to our clinical diagnosis of myocardial necrosis correct take to cause a positive prognostic significance.",0

The chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (brand name Adriamycin) is very effective against a wide range of cancers - including breast cancer and childhood leukemia. But in around 8% of patients, it causes cardiotoxicity, where the heart muscles become damaged, and in severe cases, leads to heart failure.

Fact: Toxins area unit Killing You And Your waist Believe it or not, folks consumed primarily the precise same of foods and nutrients for our entire two hundred,000 year-history-that is, up till regarding sixty years agone. Then, food firms began ?synthesizing? nutrients to cut back prices and conjointly began adding additives and preservatives to extend shelf-life of foods to ultimately increase profits. In theory, these synthesized ingredients have the precise same chemical properties as their all-natural counterparts and will so offer the body with the nutrients it wants for traditional operate. In reality: These substances-found in just about each food and drinkable you consume-are NOT a similar and our bodies understand it. The term ?bio-availability? refers to the body?s chance of recognizing, absorbing, and really employing a nutrient it consumes. as an example, a kiwi would be thought-about to possess a high bio-availability for fat-soluble vitamin since it?s Associate in Nursing organic supply and really seemingly to be recognized, absorbed, and employed by your body. however a health supplement made in a very work would be thought-about to possess an occasional bio-availability for that very same fat-soluble vitamin and therefore less seemingly to truly have any profit for your body. But it does not finish there. Those unused artificial ingredients do not simply disappear if your body cannot use them-they should be disposed of as a result of your body currently considers them to be ?toxins?. after you area unit young and your body is in peak condition, this is often not a haul in the slightest degree and also the body eliminates them terribly quickly. As you age, however, your body merely cannot eliminate the toxins as quick as you ingest them. Since your body cannot simply enable toxins to accumulate in your blood stream, it stores them in your skin cells primarily and continually right next to fat deposits. Now you recognize those previous few stubborn pounds we are able to ne?er appear to eliminate in spite of what proportion we have a tendency to starve ourselves or exercise? Well, your body will ne?er burn those fat deposits if {they area unit|they?re} adjacent to keep toxins-so till those toxins are finally purged, the fat deposits can stay. sadly, it gets a lot of worse than not having the ability to shed those previous few stubborn pounds. The presence of poisons stimulates a wonderfully activity in your body known as oxidation-basically, this is often your body metabolizing chemical element to assist it complete bound functions, like purging toxins. This dead activity causes a really nasty and doubtless deadly by product: Free Radicals. Free radicals are literally one amongst the foremost current and deadly health crises within the world nowadays and nevertheless virtually nobody is aware of their true danger as a result of they?re for the most part caused by the terribly foods and beverages we have a tendency to all consume-or rather the additives, preservatives, and artificial ingredients found in just about everything we have a tendency to ingest. however off from some harmless nuisance, scientific studies have once and for all coupled free radicals to an outsized vary of terribly serious health issues, including: ? accrued Risk of heart failure and arteria coronaria sickness ? accrued Risk of Stroke ? accrued Risk for canal issues as well as Constipation and IBS ? Poor visual sense ? Slower biological process Function/Weight Gain ? accrued Dry Skin, Premature Wrinkles, Dry Hair ? accrued Risk for a few types of Cancer as well as carcinoma ? accrued Risk for Kidney/Liver sickness Basically, free radicals attack and destroy healthy cells all throughout your body-basically inflicting your cells to ?age? a lot of quicker than traditional as a result of they cause harm right down to the polymer level. So What are often Done? Well, since just about each food and drinkable we have a tendency to consume is formed with additives, preservatives, and alternative artificial ingredients, it?ll be just about not possible to fully eliminate your poisonous substance intake unless you propose on growing your own food. However, there area unit specific foods, beverages, and activities that area unit famous to considerably increase atom production, including: ? Caffeine ? Alcohol ? Dehydration ?

Let me be clear: our plans are not about elective care but about improving the consistency of urgent and emergency care at evenings and weekends. To do this, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has prioritised 4 key clinical standards that need to be met. These include making sure patients are seen by a senior decision maker no more than 14 hours after arrival at hospital; 7 day availability of diagnostic tests with a 1 hour turnaround for the most critically ill patients; 24 hour access to consultant directed interventions, such as interventional radiology or endoscopy; and twice daily reviews of patients in high dependency areas such as intensive care units. Thirdly, there is the concern that proper 7 day services need support services for doctors in the weekends and evenings as much as doctors themselves. Less than half of hospitals are currently meeting the standard on weekend diagnostic services, meaning patients needing urgent or emergency tests on a Saturday or Sunday, such as urgent ultrasounds for gallstones or diagnostics for acute heart failure, face extra hours in hospital at weekends or even days of anxiety waiting for weekday tests. Our new standards will change this, with senior clinician-directed diagnostic tests available 7 days a week for all hospitals by 2020.",0

Every step improvement from better diagnostic and delivery could provide monumental benefits to end user and to drug/delivery providers!,"Have to page through 9 slides 8 Rheumatoid Arthritis Medication Side Effects By Chris Iliades, MD Reviewed by Farrokh Sohrabi, MD Minimizing the Risks of Rheumatoid Arthritis Treatment Although there's a range of drugs that can treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), they can all have significant side effects. ?Some are common and some not so common,"" says Diane Horowitz, MD, an assistant professor of rheumatology at the Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine in Hempstead, New York. Whether you're taking steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to control your symptoms, or using disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to manage your RA condition, you and your doctor should discuss any potential side effects that can occur during your treatment. Here are eight RA medication side effects to be aware of. NSAIDs and Stomach Problems NSAIDs, which block the inflammation of RA, can be present in both prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen. The most common side effects are stomach problems like heartburn and belching, but you can minimize these risks by taking the medication with food. And just remember: ?Once you start RA management, NSAID use should be only for add-on symptom relief,? says Matthew Husa, MD, a rheumatologist and assistant professor in the division of rheumatology and immunology at the Ohio State Medical Center in Columbus. NSAIDs and Bleeding Using NSAIDs can irritate the lining of your stomach, which can then lead to bleeding. (And unfortunately, taking the medication with food might not help.) ""If you are frequently taking over-the-counter NSAIDs, you need to let your doctor know,"" says Dr. Horowitz. Your provider might be able to give you a medication that will reduce your risk of bleeding while taking NSAIDs. And in the meantime, you can further cut your risk by avoiding alcohol. Steroids and Toxicity Steroids in RA management get symptoms under control quickly. But they may also cause high blood pressure, weight gain, high blood sugar, and decreased bone health. That's one reason they're a better short-term solution: ?Steroids can be used for a while until DMARDs kick in,"" Dr. Husa says. ""They are guaranteed to be toxic if you use them too long."" By limiting your exposure, your doctor can help protect you from steroid side effects. Methotrexate Fog Trexall (methotrexate) is usually the first DMARD used for RA management. Methotrexate does more than relieve symptoms ? it also slows down the disease, states the Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center. It is given once a week as an injection or can be taken in pill form. Common side effects include nausea, headaches, fatigue, and feeling wiped out ? almost as if you're in a fog. But by taking methotrexate at night, you may be able to minimize these problems. Likewise, you can avoid feeling nauseous if you opt for the injection under the skin. Taking folic acid, a B vitamin, along with methotrexate, may also help limit side effects, Horowitz says. Methotrexate Liver Damage The most serious side effect of methotrexate is liver damage. (That's why people with existing liver disease aren't good candidates for this medication, according to the Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center.) ""You should have your liver checked with a blood test when you start methotrexate and about every two months while you are taking it,"" Husa says. To avoid liver damage while taking the medication, limit alcoholic drinks to a maximum of one or two per week. Triple Therapy and Eye Damage Combining methotrexate with two other DMARDs may be an option if methotrexate alone isn't enough to achieve good RA management, according to Johns Hopkins. One of the drugs used in this triple therapy is hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that's effective for some cases of RA. For this particular DMARD, the most serious possible side effect is eye damage. Although you should have an eye exam by an eye specialist within six months of starting this drug (and be rechecked at regular intervals recommended by your rheumatologist), you should tell your doctor immediately if you start having eye pain, sensitivity to light, or vision changes, says Horowitz. Biologic Drugs and Infection Biologic drugs are the newest addition to RA management. Your doctor may recommend one of these drugs if older DMARDs are not helping. ?The biggest worry with biologics is an increased risk of infection,"" Horowitz says. Before you begin treatment with biologic drugs, your doctor is likely to test you for tuberculosis and hepatitis because biologics weaken your immune system and could reactivate those infections. And if you have another active infection, your doctor may want to wait until you recover. Once you begin using biologics, wash your hands frequently, avoid people who are sick, and tell your doctor if you develop a cough, fever or symptoms of a cold. Biologic Drugs and Other Issues There are rare reports that biologic drugs can possibly increase the risk for some cancers, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, and heart failure, Husa says, but the research is still inconclusive. In any case, the benefits of a biologic outweigh these risks, Husa says. Your best defense against all RA medication side effects is to be informed and follow all your doctor?s instructions carefully. http://www.everydayhealth.com/pictures/ra-medication-side-effects/#01",0

Recent Business Highlights During and since the fourth quarter of 2015, the company: Announced positive top-line results from the Phase 2b ixCELL-DCM clinical trial of ixmyelocel-T in patients with heart failure due to ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy; Received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the Epicel? (cultured epidermal autografts) HDE supplement, which revised the Epicel product label to include pediatric patients and specify the probable survival benefit for adult and pediatric patients treated with Epicel, and allows the company to sell Epicel for profit on up to 360,400 grafts per year; Announced that the FDA has accepted for filing the BLA for MACI? (matrix applied characterized autologous cultured chondrocytes), the company?s investigational third-generation autologous cultured chondrocyte implant intended for the treatment of symptomatic full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee in adult patients; Announced a long-term supply agreement with Matricel GmbH for the collagen membrane used in the production of MACI; Achieved 14% growth in total Carticel? (autologous cultured chondrocytes) and Epicel net product revenues for 2015 over pro-forma Carticel and Epicel revenues for 2014, and 5% growth in total Carticel and Epicel net product revenues in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2014; Achieved 60% and 24% growth in Epicel net product revenues for 2015 and the fourth quarter, respectively, versus the same periods in 2014; and Entered into a $10 million credit facility and $5 million term loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. ?2015 was an extremely productive year during which we completed our corporate transformation into a sustainable and growing commercial enterprise, substantially increased revenues and gross margins, and made significant progress on our clinical and regulatory objectives that we expect will drive current and long-term growth for the company,? said Nick Colangelo, president and CEO of Vericel. ?We believe that we have positioned the company as one of the leading cell therapy and regenerative medicine companies in the industry.? Financial Highlights Total revenues for the fourth quarter and year ended 2015 were generated primarily from net sales of Carticel implants and surgical kits and Epicel, which were acquired on May 30, 2014 as part of the acquisition of Sanofi?s cell therapy and regenerative medicine business. Total net revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 were approximately $15.4 million and included approximately $11.3 million of net sales of Carticel implants and surgical kits and approximately $4.1 million of net sales of Epicel. Total Carticel and Epicel net product revenues in the fourth quarter increased approximately 5% over the same period in 2014. Total net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately $51.2 million, including approximately $35.2 million of net sales of Carticel implants and surgical kits and approximately $15.2 million of net sales of Epicel. Total Carticel and Epicel net product revenues for 2015 increased approximately 14% over pro-forma Carticel and Epicel net product revenues for 2014. Total revenues for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015 included approximately $0.1 million and $0.7 million of sales, respectively, from our Marrow Donation business which ceased operations in December, 2015. Gross profit for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015 was $8.2 million, or 53% of net product sales, and $24.7 million, or 48% of net product sales, respectively, compared to $8.0 million, or 54% of net product sales, and $11.5 million, or 40% of net product sales, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014, respectively. Research and development expenses for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015 were $7.4 million and $18.9 million, respectively, versus $5.8 million and $21.3 million for the same periods in 2014. The increase in research and development expenses in the fourth quarter is primarily due to additional research, development and regulatory costs incurred for the Biologics License Application (BLA) for MACI and Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) supplement submitted in December 2015 to revise the labeled indications for use of Epicel, which included $2.2 million in regulatory consulting expenses and a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) filing fee of $2.4 million paid in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in full-year research and development expenses is primarily due to a reduction in expenses associated with the ixCELL-DCM clinical trial, which completed enrollment in January 2015, and other clinical trial expenses, and a $3.2 million payment in 2014 to the former shareholders of Verigen pursuant to a settlement agreement that eliminated all future milestone payments related to the development and commercialization of MACI in the United States. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015 were $5.7 million and $22.5 million, respectively, compared to $4.5 million and $13.8 million for the same periods in 2014. The increase in SG&A expenses is primarily due to Vericel(VCEL) being a commercial business for all of 2015 compared to only seven months in 2014, as well as an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with Carticel and Epicel and strategic planning activities for MACI. Loss from operations for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015 was $5.0 million and $16.7 million, respectively, compared to $2.3 million and $23.5 million for the same periods a year ago. The operating loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 included $2.2 million for MACI BLA and Epicel HDE supplement regulatory consulting expenses and a $2.4 million PDUFA filing fee for MACI. Excluding these one-time expenses, the company would have had an adjusted operating loss of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter. Material non-cash items impacting the operating loss for the quarter and year included $0.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense and $0.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively, in depreciation and amortization expense. Other income (expense) for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015 was less than $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, compared to less than ($0.1) million and $3.6 million for the same periods in 2014. The change in other income for the quarter is primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of warrants in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease in other income for the full year 2015 is primarily due to a bargain purchase gain of $3.5 million recognized in 2014 and a decrease in the fair value of warrants in 2015 compared to 2014. Vericel (VCEL) reported a net loss for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015 of $4.9 million, or $0.28 per share, and $16.3 million, or $0.97 per share, respectively, compared to a net loss of $2.4 million, or $0.17 per share, and $19.9 million, or $2.23 per share, for the same periods in 2014.

Last night I did about a gram of coke. Today I am getting very frequent irregular heartbeats probably once every 20 minutes. I'm taking a wild guess here, and I'm going to say that this isn't normal. Last dose (a key bump) was well over 10 hours ago, and while the irregular heartbeats have stopped being so frequent, they are still occurring every hour or so. I'm just wondering if I can die even after 10 hours of my last dose? Basically, how long is the window for after Coke usage and heart failure problems? Am I in the clear? Most likely not going to touch it again after last night. I've done it multiple times, however I think I went above and beyond last night as a gram is an extremely large amount for me. Thanks for all and any comments. Cheers",0

(1949) and his own ?Why Don?t You Love Me? (1950). But one big thing is left out of the movie: the singer?s mysterious death. It was something he apparently saw coming. On the evening of December 30, 1952, the restless, rail-thin 29-year-old tossed and turned in bed at his home in Montgomery, Ala. When new wife Billie Jean asked what was the matter, she claimed his reply was, ?I think I see God comin? down the road.? Hank Williams in 1948 Photo: Getty Images Within 48 hours of Williams? prediction, he had met his maker, but the circumstances surrounding how he died have given rise to one of music history?s greatest debates. ?I think he had a profound sadness in him,? says Marc Abraham, writer and director of the new biopic. ?Tom [Hiddleston, the actor portraying Williams] puts across that impending sense of doom. Hank felt there was something bad around the corner.? There is a framework of events that is largely agreed upon, starting with Williams being chauffeured to a planned New Year?s Eve show in Charleston, W. Va. The singer, who suffered from a back problem, was given a sedative by his regular doctor ? who had allegedly purchased a fake medical diploma through the mail and was rumored to frequently overprescribe ? before setting off with a college student named Charles Carr acting as his driver. But inclement weather meant they couldn?t get to Charleston, so the concert was canceled and they instead made a pit stop at the Andrew Johnson Hotel in Knoxville, Tenn. Williams had already been drinking when he was given a shot of B12 and morphine by the hotel doctor. Just before midnight, Carr set about getting Williams to a planned New Year?s Day show in Canton, Ohio. Most accounts have Williams looking and sounding groggy, and hotel porters allegedly had to carry him to the car. About six or seven hours later, on the morning of Jan. 1, 1953, Carr realized his passenger was dead and already beset with rigor mortis. When the singer?s death was announced to the waiting crowd at the Palace Theatre in Canton, they sang Williams? ?I Saw the Light? in unison. ?I think I see God comin? down the road? - Hank Williams to wife, Billie Jean, shortly before he died But suspicions about this final journey arose immediately. Officials listed his cause of death as heart failure but noted that body contusions meant he had recently been in a fight. At the time, Carr?s nervous account of the final few hours of the journey were enough to raise questions of foul play, especially when some witnesses ? including a police officer ? claimed to have, oddly, seen a soldier also riding in the car. Some biographers (including Colin Escott, whose book ?I Saw the Light? provides the basis for the film) have suggested that Williams may have even died at the Andrew Johnson in Knoxville, and that Carr had unwittingly driven several hundred miles with a corpse. It was also something that was suggested by the initial police report. (Carr died in 2013 and, for much of his life, kept silent on his journey with Williams.) But as Jack Neely, executive director of the Knoxville History Project explains, local folklore tells a different story. ?In recent years, a Knoxvillian . . . has been telling people he was the doorman at the Andrew Johnson, and he says Hank was conscious and joking when he left.? Carr had insisted that Williams couldn?t have been dead in Knoxville, because they had spoken briefly in the car after leaving town. Local lore also places Williams at a Knoxville hospital getting a second shot of morphine ? this in addition to the one administered by the hotel doctor ? that might have caused a drug overdose. There?s so much conjecture that both ?I Saw the Light? and the 1964 biopic, ?Your Cheatin? Heart,? chose to avoid depicting the final journey altogether. ?I actually wrote 13 pages for that scene but took them out because they felt superfluous,? explains Abraham. ?To have a kid [Carr] turn around, feel his pulse and realize [Williams] was dead, it felt anticlimactic.? Besides, Neely adds, ?No matter which account you pick, there are going to be people who say, ?That?s not how it happened.? ?

Are you sure you can't get coverage for cardiac rehab? Medicare covers it for people with CHF -- I know you are too young for Medicare, but that often suggests that other insurance covers it as well. If you have to """"go it alone"""", you might have the option of finding a qualified trainer at a hospital-based fitness center to help get you started. I work with a couple of CHF clients who are in the same boat and we have other trainers who are qualified as well. If you are clinically stable, esp if you have an AICD, then moderate exercise is probably safe (obviously go w/the cardiologist recommendations). A fairly recent review of exercise treatments for patients w/CHF showed virtually no exercise-related incidents among hundreds of study subjects. If you just want to start some activity, then walking for short periods of time is likely a """"do no harm"""" type of activity until you get more specific guidelines from the cardiologist. I actually do have Medicare (and Medicaid) because I'm on Disability. I had a stroke 10 years ago (because of A-fib), kept trying to work, and I just can't keep up with stuff. Even simple desk jobs end up being too much, if I try to go every day of the week, eventually my heart MAKES me rest by freaking out and putting me in the ER. So now I supplement my income by working from home on my good days (I repair small gas engines during good weather, do article writing on the internet in the winter). This is what's frustrating. Mentally, I'm all rarin' to go... physically, I'm so """"bleh"""", and it's getting worse. I don't want to be home bound (or even bed bound) before I'm a senior citizen! LOL No ICD or pacemaker, because my heart is so funky that they actually wouldn't work. I've had a couple ablations and I do take Metoprolol, which helps keeps my rhythm steady, a little bit.

Not!,"Was at one time prescribed seroquel and it made my condition worse. The so called Doctor at the time kept raising the dosage and it kept getting worse. I ended up in Hospital for 3 weeks. This medication can cause permanent tremors in the body. Now my hands shake if I try to do any fine work or sometimes when I pick things up. Because of this I can no longer draw by hand. This has forever been taken from me. It 's also cause Heart attacks. Irregular heartbeat. It can even cause Heart failure to set in. I am told there is a chance I've had a heart attack and I'm in heart failure. The convergence of my physical problems and the side effects seems a bit more than random. It also can cause memory loss and I am very forgetful now. It seems the bad doctoring has literally destroyed my life. Risperidone is what I am on now. It works perfect for controlling my condition. It also causes rapid weight gain and I'm over 440lbs at this moment and was almost 500 at one point. This medication has more than likely kept me from being homeless and talking to God in the streets. But it has damaged me. The first medication made it worse and put me three a living he'll for 6 months of my life. It also may have shortened my life quite a bit. What can I say. A doctor why never figured out what was wrong with me or why damaged me in unforgivable ways. She then gave me back my sanity but at a very high price. Now with all my medical problems I tend to be ignored constantly by doctors who literally won't let me describe what is happening in detail. I am often passed off and sent home untreated. I have been in unspeakable pain and given over the counter meds that are for pain one tenth of what I was in. I also have a doctor who does not believe fibromyalgia and CFS is real. I'm stuck. If I move to a different province I will end up in poverty as disability here pays way more than other places. Here I can't always eat healthy all the way threw the month on what I make, but I'm doing a lot better than I was. To put it in perspective, I'm stuck and I'm done for.",1

Billy T. James is a New Zealand entertainment icon, still fondly remembered for his many television appearances, plus starring as a maori mexican bandit on the show ?From a Hot Friday?. Billy pushed the boundaries of comedy, with his well known giggle stuck in the country?s popular culture. Billy T. James grew up known as William James Te Wehi Taitoko, first living in the Waikato town of Leamington before moving to Whangarei. At his well known high school he sang and played the guitar in a school band. He was an outstanding artist and produced amazing sketches and portraits. Billy then aimed for an apprenticeship as a signwriter after leaving school. Around his 20?s, he received an invitation to join the Maori Volcanics band and before he knew it he was travelling around the world performing for small and large audiences. As Billy T James aged he won many different awards his first being the 1984 Feltex Television awards Best Entertainment award. But it wasn?t long before he earned himself another award being the 1985 Entertainer of the Decade for the period 1975 - 1984 In the same year he won the 1985 Variety Artists club of New Zealand Golden Microphone. Before he proceeded in his comedy career the next year he put another award on his shelf being the 1986 Members of British empire (MBE) For services entertainment. Later in the year he managed one of the biggest achievements any comedian could dream of, the 1986 GOFTA listener Film and Television In the form of Best performance in a non dramatic role - television: For the Billy T James show. But that wasn?t it he was going to keep going with his entertainment career and he was going to continue to show dominance upon the rest of the comedians and that's when he took ownership of the Best Entertainment Programme award: For the Billy T James show and the Best Male Performance in a supporting role - Film For a Came a Hot Friday. And then Billy T James could only manage one more award, he had finally reached the limit, he could not go any further because of his heart failure and that final award was the 1990 Variety Artists Club of New Zealand Benny Award (supreme Award). In 1988 Billy T. James suffered a major heart attack and was rushed to hospital to undergo a quadruple bypass operation. Unfortunately while the operation was unsuccessful he was later granted a heart through a donor. Billy was alive and well but it did not last long before his health started to deteriorate. And soon after his transplant he became sick and suffered heart failure again. On the 7th of August 1991 his body finally gave in and this is when his well- lived life came to an end in Greenlane Hospital Auckland. 18 years later Billy was still recognised as one of New Zealand?s greatest talents where he was voted as the country?s greatest comedian to ever live. As he progressed through his life he showed leadership and inspiration to the young and to people who wanted to be like him. He showed that no matter what happens you can keep going and that you can be anything that you dream of being starting as a signwriter and becoming an outstanding entertainer. He was shot at he lived through heart surgery and he made everyone laugh. Personally to me his tv shows and his youtube clips are old but are still funny and by just watching his videos he has taught me things and has showed me how to be a leader. As of 2016 Billy T James continues to be a vivid memory as part of New Zealand Kiwiana.",0

Thanks very much. Sessekou Arrey-Mbi Sammy On Feb 3, 2016 5:05 PM, <fred.kemah@hotmail.co.uk> wrote: Dear Community, Just to remind you that black people are at risk of sudden death compared to the white counterparts. The ratio is 3:1 .There are many variants of sudden death syndrome and will invite you to have a read about this condition. Also, I would invite you to take precautionary measures when planning long haul flights. Women are more vulnerable to developing clots. Hormones to blame? Men are more at risk of sudden deaths. Overall blacks tend to die suddenly and unexpectedly. For example : At high altitudes there are significant changes to our circulatory system and our body automatically adapts. In order to avoid sinister events especially sudden or expected deaths when flying long distances please endeavour to do the following : A) Secure a travel insurance especially if you are age 45 and above. The airliner will rush you straight to hospital or arrange for emergency landing just to safe your life. B) If you have been experiencing chest pains, palpitations, breathlessness, lightheadedness, leg pains, collapse , etc then, see a doctor before engaging in long haul flights. Be courageous to ask your GP/doctor to assess your blood biochemistry( anaemia and platelets) and in particular the levels of D- DIMERS. If elevated , then your must avoid flying until you exclude clots in any part of your body. Also ask for BNP levels as high levels could reflect an underlying Heart Failure. This could lead to sudden death at high altitudes. C) Please do what ever it takes to see a Cardiologist or have at least an ECG (electrical assessment of the heart) and possibly and Echocardiogramme (mechanical function) before you embark in intense and regular physical activity. Malignant Ventricular arrhythmia is the main cause of sudden death. So you MUST have at least a full 12 lead ECG done before you attend Gym as a black person. Out of medicine: If your child goes out partying, I must ask you to go collect your son/daughter and drive him/her back home after partying with friends. If you leave his/her best friend to drive, then you could end up like some of us. This is my contribution to the community following recent episodes of sudden and unexpected deaths in our communities. Conclusion: In my dialect we say "" Nakati na salon de coiffure, tour na yo peh eko ya"". Literally, in a barber's shop , we all have our turn. However, you could still prolong your turn by taking the necessary precautions. With best wishes. Fred Kemah ( Le Mola ) London.

Dr. Swaminathan is an assistant professor of emergency medicine and the assistant residency director of the NYU/Bellevue Emergency Medicine residency. He is the co-creator of the EM Lyceum blog (http://emlyceum.com) and the editor and chief of the Core EM blog (www.coreem.net). His interests are in resuscitation, residency education and knowledge translation. You?re working the overnight shift, it?s 6:15 a.m., and you?re starting to dream of a breakfast sandwich and bed. But, no, it?s your lucky morning, and in rolls a 55-year-old man in acute respiratory distress. He is hypertensive, tachycardic, and tachypneic. A quick bedside ultrasound reveals bilateral B lines that convince you that the patient is in acute pulmonary edema (APE) or acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). The 12-lead ECG reveals only sinus tachycardia, and your nurse asks you how much furosemide you want to give. Congestive heart failure is a common problem in the United States with more than five million patients carrying the diagnosis and 500,000 new diagnoses each year. (Mt. Sinai J Med2006;73[2]:506.) APE occurs when blood backs up into the pulmonary vasculature, leading to increased oncotic pressure and leakage of fluid into the alveolar spaces. Put more simply: These patients are drowning. APE patients suffer from increased afterload ? making it more difficult for the left ventricle to function ? and increased preload. As such, the goals of treatment must be directed at decreasing cardiac filling pressures (preload) and decreasing afterload. Neurohormonal activation also worsens cardiac performance and increases intravascular volume and vascular tone. The mainstay of APE treatment for decades has been loop diuretics, mainly furosemide. The central role these drugs continue to play highlights a lack of understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Pathophysiology of APE The cardiorenal model was first put forward in the 1940s as the predominant explanation for APE. It was believed that decreased blood flow to the kidneys led to decreased renal function and fluid retention leading to volume overload. This was the basis for loop diuretics being recommended. It was clear, however, that this model was insufficient because it did not explain why the disease progressed or the finding of increased peripheral vasoconstriction from invasive monitoring studies. The cardiocirculatory model was first put forth in the 1970s. This model argued that peripheral vasoconstriction led to decreased cardiac function, and that increased preload and afterload were at the center of the problem. This model explained much of what we see occurring in APE. Finally, researchers in the 1990s established the neurohormonal model, in which neurohormones (norepinephrine, renin, angiotensin, aldosterone) are upregulated in APE. These compounds have vasoactive properties leading to vasoconstriction and increase intravascular volume. Current recommendations for APE treatment are based on the integration of the cardiovascular and the neurohormonal models. The Myth of Volume Overload Regardless of the pathophysiology, patients are still volume overloaded, right? The best evidence suggests it is not that simple. Zile, et al. demonstrated that most patients with APE have increased cardiac filling pressures, but most did not have a significant increase from their dry weight on presentation. (Circulation 2008;118[14]:1433.) More than 50 percent of patients, in fact, gain less than two pounds. (Circulation2007;116[14]:1549.) If this is not fluid gain, where did the increased filling pressure originate? It turns out it is largely a result of changes in compliance in the splanchnic system that leads to fluid shifting from here to the cardiopulmonary circulation. (Circ Heart Fail2011;4[5]:669.) Even in the face of this evidence, the loop diuretic supporters argue that some patients are overloaded, so why not give all of these patients the drug? This approach does not account for the potential downsides. Administration of furosemide activates the neurohormonal system, which leads to increased plasma renin and norepinephrine levels. This results in decreased LV function, increased LV filling pressure, increased MAP and SVR, and decreased GFR. (Ann Intern Med 1985;103[1]:1.) An ICU study from 1990 found that furosemide increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in the first 20 minutes of treatment. (Chest 1990;98[1]:124.) This is particularly worrisome because APE is a deadly disease, and what we do in the first 10 to 15 minutes of the patient?s presentation makes a huge difference. So how should we treat patients with APE? ? Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV): NIPPV has multifactorial action in APE. It decreases work of breathing, stents-open alveoli during the entire respiratory cycle, leading to improved gas exchange, and, in the case of bilevel NIPPV, decreases afterload. A number of papers have shown decreased intubation rates and decreased ICU utilization with the use of NIPPV. The most recent study showed a decreased ICU admission from 92 to 38 percent. (J Emerg Med 2014;46[1]:130.) A 2008 Cochrane review also found that NIPPV reduced hospital mortality (RR 0.6) and endotracheal intubation (RR 0.53). (Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2008 Jul 18;[3]:CD005351.) The key for NIPPV is to start it immediately on presentation to the ED. It will likely help with preoxygenation even if it does not stave off intubation. ? Nitroglycerin: Many studies have looked at the use of nitroglycerin, comparing it with furosemide and evaluating at high-dose therapy. (Am J Cardiol 1978;41[5]:931; Lancet1998;351[9100]:389; Ann Emerg Med 2007;50[2]:144.) Nitroglycerin is recommended for all patients with APE. It reduces preload and at higher doses (> 100 mcg/min), and it decreases afterload, leading to increased cardiac output and decreased SVR. (Am J Cardiol1978;41[5]:931.) Despite widespread use, robust randomized studies enrolling the sickest APE patients are lacking.",0

BLOG,http://thefoodchannelrecipe.blogspot.com,http://thefoodchannelrecipe.blogspot.com/2016/04/7-health-benefits-of-potassium.html,4/26/2016,19:53:00,4/27/2016 5:23,7 Health Benefits of Potassium,"The best food sources of potassium: The recommended daily value of 4,700 milligrams for adult men and women.) How to Solve an Electrolyte Imbalance1. Adjust Your Diet The first step to correcting an electrolyte imbalance is to identify how it developed in the first place. For many people, a poor diet that?s high in processed foods containing lots of sodium, but low in other electrolytes like magnesium or potassium, paves the way for a dangerous imbalance. In many cases, a minor electrolyte imbalance can be corrected by simply making dietary changes and cutting way back on junk foods, takeout and restaurant foods, while instead cooking more fresh foods at home. Focus your diet around whole, unpackaged foods ? especially plenty of vegetables and fruits that provide potassium and magnesium. Some of the best include leafy greens, cruciferous veggies like broccoli or cabbage, starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes or squash, bananas, and avocados. A diet that?s rich in magnesium or potassium likely can be enough to solve problems like low potassium levels that can lead to blood pressure problems or magnesium deficiency that can contribute to anxiety, restlessness and muscle cramps. To prevent dehydration and restore electrolytes, focus on these foods ? which are some of the most hydrating due to being very water-dense: Coconut water Celery Watermelon Cucumber Kiwi Bell peppers Citrus fruit Carrots Cultured dairy (amasai/kefir/yogurt) PineappleAnother thing to consider is whether you?re consuming enough calcium. With or without eating dairy products, it?s possible to get calcium from leafy greens, other veggies, beans and legumes. To obtain enough calcium naturally without needing supplements, consider adding high-quality and ideally raw dairy products to your diet if you can tolerate them. Foods like organic probiotic yogurt, cultured raw cheeses and raw milk provide high levels of electrolytes in addition to other important nutrients. 2. Monitor Your Sodium Intake When you do consume packaged or processed foods, check the sodium levels. Sodium is an electrolyte that plays a significant part in the body?s ability to retain or release water, so if your diet is very high in sodium, more water is excreted by the kidneys, and this can cause complications with balancing other electrolytes. Here?s how sodium works within the body: Essentially, water follows salt, which means if you increase sodium too much, water retention also occurs. At the same time, the opposite is also true: A loss in sodium results in a loss in water, potentially causing dehydration and extreme thirst. Hypernatremia (the name of the condition that develops when either too much water is lost or too much sodium is obtained) is more common among older adults, people with diabetes and those who eat heavily processed diets. People can also lose a high level of sodium through diarrhea, taking certain diuretics or laxatives, and exercising to extreme levels and overtraining without staying hydrated ? all of which cause problems of their own. Monitoring how much sodium you consume helps keep symptoms at bay, including bloating, lethargy, dehydration, weakness, irritability and muscle twitching. Drinking water and eating mostly whole foods (not the kinds that come in packages!) also ensures you obtain enough other important electrolytes. 3. Drink Enough Water (but Not Too Much) Electrolyte imbalances can develop when the amount of water in your body changes, either causing dehydration (not enough water compared to certain elevated electrolytes) or overhydration (too much water). Drinking enough water, without over-diluting your cells, helps stop levels of sodium and potassium from rising too high or too low. How much water is the right amount for you? It all depends on your specific needs. Do you exercise often? Do you live in a warm climate that results in you sweating? Do you eat a lot of water-rich fruits or vegetables, or more processed foods? While ?eight glasses a day? has always been the standard recommendation, this isn?t necessarily the best amount for every person, since factors like your diet, age, physical activity level and body size all determine how much water you need. A good rule of thumb is to drink enough so you urinate at least every three to four hours, which for most people is around eight to 10 eight-ounce glasses daily. If you practice vigorous exercise (especially in warm/hot weather that increases sweat production), make sure to replenish with plenty of water and electrolytes (like premade formulas that include sodium). If you?ve been sick (including with a fever that causes vomiting or diarrhea), keep in mind that you lose fluids and should increase your intake. If not, you risk developing dehydration symptoms, kidney stones, bladder infections, urinary tract stones and potentially even heart failure. That?s why it?s so important to protect yourself from dehydration. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding also need additional fluids (about 10?13 cups every day) to stay hydrated and prevented deficiencies, as do teenagers who are growing and developing faster than people of other ages. Is it possible to drink too much water? Over-hydration is rare, but yes, it?s possible. Your kidneys are unable to excrete very high levels of excess water, so this can mean electrolytes within the blood can become diluted. The result might be low sodium levels, which is more common among endurance athletes (who often try to compensate for sweating by drinking lots of water) but not very likely to develop in someone eating the standard American diet that?s high in salt.

The Latest on the death of ""Star Trek"" film actor Anton Yelchin (all times local): 9:45 a.m. The SUV that killed ""Star Trek"" actor Anton Yelchin was being recalled because the gear shifters have confused drivers, causing the vehicles to roll away unexpectedly. Los Angeles police say Yelchin died when his 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee rolled down his driveway early Sunday. The SUV pinned the 27-year-old against a brick mailbox pillar and a security fence. Fiat Chrysler, which makes Jeeps, said in a statement Monday that it's investigating and it's premature to speculate on the cause of the crash. It offered sympathies to Yelchin's friends and family. Most 2015 model year Grand Cherokees were part of a global recall of 1.1 million vehicles announced by Fiat Chrysler in April. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration urged the recall amid complaints that drivers had trouble telling if they had put the automatic transmissions in park. If they weren't in park and a driver left the vehicle, it could roll away. ___ 9:30 a.m. A Los Angeles coroner's official says the death of ""Star Trek"" actor Anton Yelchin has been ruled an accident. Coroner's spokesman Ed Winter says an autopsy performed Sunday determined the 27-year-old actor died of blunt force asphyxia after his 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee pinned him against a brick mailbox pillar and a security fence in his driveway early Sunday. Winter says any toxicology results will take months to analyze. Los Angeles police are investigating Yelchin's death. Officer Jane Kim says the investigation will look into whether the actor's vehicle was in gear or in park at the time of the accident. ___ This item has been corrected to show Yelchin was pinned against a brick mailbox pillar and a security fence.",0

They may seem overwhelming, but the big key to understanding contraindications is understanding diseases, the body, and how massage affects it. While massage has a multitude of benefits for the body, it can also be extremely taxing on one, especially if the body is already dealing with major health issues. In these cases, it is appropriate to check with their doctor, as they are more familiar with their condition. We are in an odd situation as being quasi-medical/health care workers: we know and work with the body, and yet are not doctors and cannot diagnose or treat conditions. Try to err on the side of caution as you definately do not want to cause any harm to your client. Now on to your specific questions: Medical Edema - The question here is what is causing the edema. Edema, or swelling tissues from lymphatic fluid, might indicate several dangerous conditions, including heart failure or a deep-vein thrombosis. DVT, a blood clot in a vein(usually in a leg), can suddenly shift and lodge in the lungs(called a pulmonary imbolism), to the brain(causing a stroke), or to the heart(causing a heart attack). All of these need immediate medical attention. Nervous/psychotic conditions - Massage can be okay, if the person is in a stable condition. An unstable person might need to be under medical supervision, not on your table. Massage is actually a great adjunct to medical treatment for depression, anxiety, and other conditions. There are a few considerations for some of the medications people might be taking. Trapped or pinched nerves - The danger here is further injury to the nerve or the problem that caused it in the first place. We cannot know where in problem is nor what might aggravate it. And really, massage would be more appropriate after the problem has been healed, to help the tension and stiffness that the nerve caused. Inflamed nerve - Similar to the pinched or trapped nerve. Massage brings more fluid to the area, and this might aggravate the nerve. Ice might be a better alternative, with a doctor's supervision, with massage afterwards. Bell's Palsy - Bell's Palsy is partial facial paralasys, caused by an inflamed facial nerve. While it does go away with little to no ill effects, the cause needs to be determined by a doctor. Usually it is idiopathic(basically, ""We have no idea what causes it""). It could also be uncomfortable for the person to get massaged, since they are not in a normal state. Asthma - Massage is fine for people with asthma, unless they are haveing a severe attack or if it might trigger an attack. Some massage techniques, like stripping the intercostals and CRAC stretches, actually helped me reduce the need for my inhaler Epilepsy - Again, if well treated, massage should be fine. The doctor would be the one to determine if massage is suitable for the person. There is always a chance of the client having a seizure, and can be both frightening and dangerous. Recent operations(how recent is recent?!) - As I said, massage can be very taxing on a healing body, especially if recovering from a large operation. There is always the chance of infection, for both of you, especially if the incision is still healing. You could also irritate the site by working too close to it. And generally, if the scab has fallen off, and the cut is no longer open, massage should be fine, as long as care is taken around the incision site. But again, the doctor should be contacted, especially if it was for something major, like heart problems or cancer treatment. There might be other underlying health problems that need to be taken into consideration. All of their medical history should come out in the intake interview. I have turned people away, and told them that I needed their doctor's permission before I worked on them. One woman, who had surgery one week before to remove cancerous lymph nodes, called her doctor after I told her that I could only work with the dr's word. Sure enough, he did not advise massage. I instead gave her a half hour hand and foot massage, since she was so desperate for healing and touch. So there are alternatives out there for people who cannot get massage, like reiki(Japanese hands-on energy work.) Knowing something like that can also make an nice adjunct to medical treatment. I hope this helps, Sarah. Please let me know if I can do anything else to help. Sincerely, Christopher Hall",0

July 2nd 2015 you performed in New Orleans.  I was supposed to attend with my girls. I had not been feeling well for a couple of weeks but wasn't concerned until it was time to see your show. I had a bad cough that was making my heart do weird things. I went to a clinic and told the Doctor that he needed to give me something to stop the cough because I was going to see Kevin Hart. Any time I laughed I felt like I was going to pass out. The Doctor told me I needed to go to the ER because I was in Atrial fibrillation.  I go to the ER they admit me for Afib and Congestive Heart Failure. I tried to talk them into getting me better by noon the next day, when we were supposed to leave for your show.  Obviously this did not happen. My girls visited me in the hospital. Anyway I don't know if you will see this message or not. I just thought you should know that is how you, Kevin Hart, saved my life!!",1

Nonetheless, it can often be misleading and could not necessarily give a superb indication with the sound high quality. I will show how the which approach of this term and also give cute suggestions on the best gangplank until explain subliminal self whilst poking for an transducer. An amplifier is designed to magnify an audio signal solid to terrace a set of speakers to transparent color cadency mark high magnitude. Producers typically publish the pitch range more than which the amp operates. Usually a lower and heart frequency are premised, similitude as 20 Hz - 20 kHz. This specification indicates that the amplifier is in a position to plug in music inside that frequency range. Themselves could continue tempted to finicking an amp that provides the largest frequency response. Nonetheless, there is far additionally to agreement an amplifier?s performance than just realizing this easy range. In fact, an amp that features a response from 10 Hz to 30 kHz can truly have considerably poorer enunciate high quality that an amp that provides a frequency response away from 20 Hz to 15 kHz. Distinct manufacturers appear to make office of various techniques to define hf return. The nearabout a lot utilised way is rapidly in passage to describe the wavering refrain as the frequency range inside which the amplifier will have after a fashion continuous amplification with a maximum retreat of 3 decibel (dB). Normally the drop in amplification is highest at the lower and upper frequency. Even so, some manufacturers push this normal for the limit and will list an poverty-stricken frequency even where the transducer will barely create a reputable anymore. Also, simply seeking at these 2 numbers does not say a lot about the linearity in the frequency response. Therefore it is greatest to identify a complete frequency response chart. Such a chart will and pleasure show inobservant of whether you can reveal unique dominant peaks ochrous valleys within the in hand light range. Peaks and valleys dismiss institute colorization of the audio. On paper the amplifier ought to have a thick-coming gain inside the undivided frequency response using the departure of the running start off in the ablated and upper uttermost. Laterad excepting the ray response, a phase response letter will also tell a good cord about the efficiency and fife high genteelness from the amp. Me also need up appear inside the conditions under which the frequency response was measured. You generally won?t uncover any response about the measurement conditions, inerrable just right, streamlined the manufacturer?s information sheeting. The fact is that big amplifiers dedication behave differently with different speaker loads. This can be on account of the fact that distinct speaker loads will trigger changes for the behavior of the output power stage from the amp. This disjoin is generality significant with many numerary amps, also known after this fashion Class-D amps. Class-d amps have a lowpass filter entryway their output inward-bound body to cushion the switching elements that are generated wherewithal the internal power FETs. Nevertheless, the frequency response of the amp now depends on the speaker multitude because the behavior of this lowpass elute is affected in harmony with the bitter draft impedance. Consistently the lower the speaker load impedance the lower the upper cut-off frequency of the amplifier. A few relating to the most recent figural amplifiers feed back the audio signal after the lowpass filter as far as be able to compensate vice this tradeoff and so make the frequency response from the amp independent with the attached load. Even so, if the amp self-consistent isn?t created effectively, this kind of wowwows be able trigger instability and lead towards tasteless secret language getting generated by the amp if variegated speakers are lucid. Other amps use transformers and offer self outputs for diverse speaker loads. Episode from improving the amplifier response with the amp, this infiltration typically altogether improves the amplifier efficiency.",0

Inadequately controlled acute pain is associated with the development of chronic pain Optimal pain relief can be achieved by pharmacological and non pharmacological measures , mindful of individual variation of response to pain and the need to have a multimodal approach . Finally decide if pain is for round the clock pain relief or PRN /breakthrough . Summary of pharmacological analgesics 1. opiate analgesics 2. NSAIDs including aspirin 3. Paracetamol 4. Analgesic adjuvants - local anesthetic / regional block 5. Anticonvulsants for post procedural neuropathic pain 6. Ketamine ( used acutely by ambulance service and only occasionally by the emergency department ) there is a very high risk of abuse / dependence By Robin Plumer Calculating IV morphine dose : Morphine-Gold standard. Calculate acute pain dose :0.1 mg per kg but less in elderly (half this dose ) So a good approach is give half the total dose stat and then the rest over a few minutes In children it's the sam 0.05 to 0.1 mg per kg Consider setting up a PCA early for patients being admitted with pain that is likely to continue Important to remember 1 mg of morphine IV = 6 mg morphine orally Renal /hepatic : expect morphine to last up to 24 hours so don't give repeated doses Other OPIATES Comparison of opiates-many tables and calculators exist, and they vary wildly in their estimates. Individual reaction to meds vary, so go slowly and remember cross tolerance if switching opiates: Someone who is opioid tolerant to one drug may NOT exhibit the same tolerance to another, so reduce dose by 50% initially Fairly good equivalences: Morphine Morphine codeine * oxycodone Fentanyl Tramadol** PO IV PO PO IV PO 10 mg 5 mg 60-120 mg 5-7.5mg 100 mcg 50-100 *codeine requires conversion to morphine and people vary from fast converters to slow converters; cannot predict this. ** tramadol is a very dirty drug which lowers the seizure threshold and interacts with SSRIs and TCAs, has more constipation and nausea For breakthrough pain, figure the 24 hr morphine dose and give 10-20% top up -especially important in chronic pain or cancer patients Converting to fentanyl patch: only in patients on an established dose Daily morphine dose (mg) Fentanyl patch(mcg) Less than 60 12.5 60-130 25 135-225 50 225-315 75 315-400 100 converting to methadone is a special case and requires consultation with a pain specialist (or palliative care specialist) Very roughly, methadone 2.5 mg= morphine 10 mg It has a very long half life, approx. 5 days so toxicity can accumulate Remember adjuvants: paracetamol, NSAIDs if appropriate, TCAs, topical therapies (lidocaine patch), nitrous oxide, ketamine Also-morphine works well subcutaneously, an IV is not essential For small doses ie in elderly, give RA Morph 1 mg/ml orally Morphine-renally excreted, so caution in renal failure In CRF fentanyl or methadone is preferred, or oxycodone If dosing IV, remember to give follow up doses. 2-3 mg IV initial dosing must be followed up until pain relief is achieved. Itching from morphine is often a histamine reaction, not a true allergy Please do not give oral pain medication in acute abdominal pain-not absorbed well, irritates gastric lining, worsens nausea Do not give codeine and tramadol together (it?s like giving 2 nsaids!) Do not layer codeine or tramadol on top of IV morphine; if they need IV morphine, just continue with enough of the morphine. If a ?morphine non-responder? then try fentanyl Constipation: Side effect that persists with opiate use ?The hand that writes the opiate should be the hand that writes the laxative prescription, or it will be the hand doing the disimpaction.? Laxatives: Laxsol 2 tabs daily or BD good starting dose, up to 3 tabs tds. Lax Sachets usually 1-3 per day but can go higher if needed. Avoid lactulose or bulk agents as they cause bloating Microlax enemas are good too Avoid Fleet enemas in older patients; can cause renal failure Anti nausea meds (nausea is worst when starting opiates) Metoclopramide 10 mg every 6 hrs Phenothiazines ie stemetil Haloperidol .5-1 mg or Droperidol .625 mg Domperidone (oral only, does not cross blood brain barrier, so OK in Parkinson?s) Ondantreson very constipating, OK in Parkinsons (most antinausea are NOT OK in Parkinsons-avoid all phenothiazines including metoclopramide in PD) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mick Killeen Oral opiates As a general rule , no more than 20 tablets should ever be prescribed as patient should be following up with community doctors . Always check concerto / computer chart to see what the previous prescriptions have been. All recent prescriptions will be on concerto . Sevredol : controlled Drug Takes up to 30 minutes to work , lasts for 4 hours , therefore prescribe four hourly PRN . Children 3-5 years get 5 mg and 5-10 mg for 6 + ( these are medsafe guidelines) MST continus / morphine LA is the drug that replaces Sevredol if the patient is on pain relief for longer . Give same total daily amount but BD with Sevredol for breakthrough In ED for acute pain we are usually just prescribing Sevredol and the dose is usually 10 mg every 4 hours PRN For chronic pain (eg cancer patients. ) Child Oxynorm and OxyContin Oxynorm is oxycodone and is a SHORT acting opiate which as a rule of thumb is TWICE as powerful as morphine . Therefore a starting dose would be 5 mg 4 hourly Oxycontin On the other hand is a LONG acting medication for chronic pain and is generally not prescribed by us . (It's the same principle of working out the dose of short acting in 24 hours and converting this to BD long acting OxyContin ) not to be given to morphine Naive patients Tramadol 100mg is equivalent to 10 mg oral Morphine It may take half an hour to reach analgesic effect and peak levels are not reached until the second day of 6 hourly dosing . As per Robins note above , Don't give with ssri's and don't give in seizure patients Renal Insufficiency give Tramadol BD Hepatic consider giving less frequently than 6 hourly Naloxone only partially reverses Tramadol Codeine , constipates , usually 30mg is as good as 60 mg and increasing dose doesn't make any difference .Rerversed by Naloxone Regarding Opiates for chronic pain See the following Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-W4DvP0qQg (It's a little bit more complicated that that but this is our philosophy on the routine prescribing of opiates for chronic non cancer pain. We have to learn from our American colleagues who have seen an exponential rise in opiate abuse in recent years ) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Non steroidal anti inflammatory medication Brufen Ibuprofen is the go to NSAID in our emergency department.

In patients at potential risk It is considered EFFICACIOUS to co treat with a PPI Not to be given to patients on warfarin Interestingly on the Oxford League tables Brufen at a dose of 800mg loading was more effective than codeine or Tramadol .http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1855338/#!po=8.33333 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ketamine for pain Very controversial - tons of room for abuse / dependence etc May have a role in acute trauma , particularly in the field For more detailed information check the following http://thesgem.com/2015/10/sgem130-low-dose-ketamine-for-acute-pain-control-in-the-emergency-department/ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Briefly Treatment regimes for neurogenic pain As per BPAC http://www.bpac.org.nz/BPJ/2008/September/docs/bpj16_neuropathic_pain_pages_13-15.pdf Step one Paracetamol Step two Add TCA (notriptilline 10 mg daily increasing by 10 mg dose to max of 50 mg Take at night .

An inquest in Bolton heard how Bolton College student Phillipe Pycroft suffered heart failure after taking a massive dose of propranolol, a beta blocker used to treat the symptoms of anxiety, high blood pressure and angina. Mr Pycroft had been prescribed 10mg of the drug by his doctor on October 13 last year, but he complained to friends that it was not working and coroner Rachael Griffin was told that on October 29 he ordered 60 80mg propranolol tablets from an American website. They arrived five days later, but at 3.15am on November 5 Mr Pycroft?s mum woke and found him collapsed on the bathroom floor at their home in Kirkby Road, Heaton . Attempts to resuscitate him at home and at the Royal Bolton Hospital failed. A post mortem examination revealed he had suffered heart failure and toxicology tests found he had 10.5ml per litre of propranolol in his system when a therapeutic level is expected to be around 0.3mg per litre. But the post mortem examination found he had no heart defects. Forensic toxicologist Julie Evans told the court that in order to reach that level Mr Pycroft would have had to have taken around 50 tablets. ?We are talking about 10s of tablets, not just a couple extra,? she said. Mr Pycroft?s parents, Anna and John Pycroft expressed alarm about the ease with which their son was able to obtain the tablets online. ?It is way too easy,? said Mr Pycroft. ?If anyone has got a problem then please go to the pharmacy and doctor first ? do not do it off your own bat.? Mrs Griffin recorded a conclusion of suicide after hearing how the teenager had been affected by the death of his grandmother, sent text messages to a friend saying he would not be missed and had visited a suicide methods website just hours before he was found collapsed. But his family do not believe he wanted to kill himself - rather he was trying to self-medicate and they are considering trying to appeal the coroner's conclusion. ?We don?t agree with the coroner?s decision,? said Mr Pycroft. ?To me he was trying to self-diagnose and came a cropper.? During the inquest Mrs Pycroft told how her son, an intelligent young man who worked part time in a local shop as well as studying at college, was athletic and enjoyed music . His friends and family were concerned about the large numbers of energy Monster drinks he would consume, but pathologist Patrick Waugh said the drinks did not play a part in his death. The court was told that in early 2015 the teenager started becoming concerned about his health after suffering heart palpitations, breathlessness and panic attacks. In July he went on holiday to Benidorm with a friend?s family and collapsed after swimming in the sea. He was taken to hospital and given a ECG test before being discharged and, on his return to England, visited his GP, who prescribed 10mg doses of propranolol and made an appointment for him to see a cardiologist on November 16. But Mrs Pycroft told the inquest that on November 3 her son told his driving instructor, ?I don?t feel so good because of the tablets the doctor has given me.? The following day he went home at 10.30pm, going out half an hour later, telling his parents he was going to the gym. He returned home at 11pm and Mr and Mrs Pycroft said that he was still downstairs and wide awake when they went to bed at about 12.30am. College friend Emma Rhodes revealed that he had told her he wasn?t getting any benefit from the tablets given to him by the doctor and, in text messages the night he died told her he did not want to be here. But Miss Rhodes stressed she did not believe he would have deliberately tried to kill himself. Recording her conclusion, Mrs Griffin said: ?Phillipe?s death is a tragedy of the utmost degree. It is shocking and will have come as great devastation to his family and all around him.? Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Pycroft described Phillipe as ?a fantastic son? and her husband appealed for people in distress to seek help from family, friends and organisations available to support them.

Scientists funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health have found that a greater number of patients with coronary artery disease may benefit from coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery than previously thought. CABG ? a surgical procedure to help improve blood flow to the heart by bypassing arteries clogged with cholesterol plaques ? was thought to be too risky for patients with the long-term effects of coronary artery disease: left ventricular dysfunction (when the left side of the heart is unable to pump normally) and heart failure. Studies of the safety and effectiveness of CABG in the 1970s excluded most patients with these two conditions. The procedure was typically used to relieve angina, or chest pain. ?With limited data showing any benefit for patients with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, physicians and patients were less likely to engage in such an invasive, and thus risky, procedure as CABG for diagnosis and treatment,? said lead author Eric J. Velazquez, MD, FACP, FACC, FASE, FAHA, of Duke University Medical Center. ?Patients with these conditions largely received medical therapy alone and had poor outcomes.? Dr. Velazquez and his team conducted a five-year global, randomized controlled clinical trial, called the Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure (STICH) study, and a five-year extension study (STICHES(link is external)), to evaluate whether CABG plus guideline-directed medical therapy had a durable benefit over medical therapy alone for patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. The researchers found that CABG added to medical therapy led to significantly lower rates of death and hospitalization among patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure. ?Our results usher in a new era in the treatment of coronary artery disease because we now have evidence that with CABG and medical therapy, there is a 16 percent reduction in the risk of death from any cause over 10 years,? Dr. Velazquez said. He added that there is also a median survival benefit of nearly a year and a half, and that he and his team saw that the addition of CABG to medical therapy prevented a death from any cause for every 14 patients they treated. Their data further suggest that the reduction in the risk of death could be even greater in real-world practice. ?Conducting this trial was critically important to determine in a scientifically rigorous study that CABG improves survival for individuals with coronary artery disease and compromised left ventricular function,? said NHLBI Director Gary H. Gibbons, MD. ?The current 10-year follow-up provides new important insights about patient subgroups that are more likely to benefit from CABG as compared to medical therapy alone. As such, we now have a solid evidence base to inform patient care and the future development of clinical practice recommendations.? Dr. Velazquez noted that the results are particularly important because the prevalence of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure is expected to increase to approximately 8 million individuals by 2030 in the U.S. alone. The increase in the projected prevalence is a result of advances in the management of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, increasingly transforming coronary artery disease into a chronic disease with long-term effects such as left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. George Sopko, MD, MPH, the program director in NHLBI?s Division of Cardiovascular Sciences who administered the study grant, added that this investigation, published in The New England Journal of Medicine (April 2016), is one of only a few cardiovascular trials with 10 years of follow-up and with approximately 98 percent of the patients followed throughout the study period. ?It is unusual to have this quality of follow-up for so long,? said Dr. Sopko. ?It speaks to the rigor of the results.? He added that the results are very generalizable, as the study included a diverse patient population spread across 22 countries and various health systems.

My little boy had his this afternoon, I was giving him a bottle before hand and he screamed and cried like Iv never heard him do before he's not really a crier more of a winger, so I carried on with his bottle afterwards and he settled down straight away, seen the doctor after for his check up and he was smiling away. Got home and gave him some calpol like the HF and nurse told me too and he had another feed about hour after and fell asleep for an hour, but since then he's just crying historically, nothing seems to settle him, Iv just tried to give him another feed and he took 4 oz which is normal for him and gave him another lot of calpol (was just over 4 hours from his last dose) and he's lying on OH chest at the min and slowly keeps dosing off but jolts awake and crys again. I'm thinking it may be his little legs hurting him because he doesn't seem hot or flushed, and he seems to cry mor when he's moved or held a certain way. Hoping he has a good sleep and let his little body sort itself out. Breaks my heart",0

Find out All about Water Retention,"Are the rings on your fingers feeling tight? Or maybe your shoes pinch or feel tight suddenly? Does your skin retain the indent for a few seconds after being pressed? These, and some other symptoms such as stiff joints and bloated tummy, may indicate fluid or water retention in your body. Also called edema, this condition is generally an annoyance, but can also signal more serious underlying conditions. Water retention occurs when fluid gets trapped in the body?s tissues, generally the feet, ankles, and legs. Causes Pressure within veins or damage to them, causes them to leak blood plasma (that is mainly water) into neighboring tissues. This fluid pools in the feet and ankles, but may also be more generalized through the entire body. Sitting on a long plane ride, standing for long periods of time, dietary deficiencies (insufficient vitamin B12 or protein), hormones associated with the menstrual cycle or with pregnancy, reaction to hot weather in the summer months, and certain medications, can all cause water retention. Consuming food and drinks high in salt content and weakened valves in the deep veins of the legs are also causes of water retention. If the swelling is mild and resolves itself within a few days, then the condition is not alarming. The excess fluid is absorbed by the body when you sleep. But if the swelling persists or worsens, or you experience shortness of breath along with it, then the condition may be worrisome, as it may signal liver, kidney, or thyroid disease, or even heart failure. Treatments Perhaps the easiest way to combat water retention is to reduce your sodium intake. If you are prone to getting edema, also avoid sitting or standing for extended periods of time. Including more protein in your diet may also be beneficial, as it encourages your body to remove excess fluid. Similarly, foods rich in potassium (think bananas) also help to remove excess fluids. Dehydrating drinks such as coffee, tea, and alcohol should be avoided. Monitoring medications that you may be taking for other medical conditions, and changing the medication or dosage may also help to relieve water retention. In more severe cases of water retention, a doctor may prescribe a diuretic to reduce swelling. Other treatments for edema depend upon the cause, severity, and other specific related conditions if any. During pregnancy, for example, excessive swelling may indicate preeclampsia, a serious condition which may be treated by bed rest, medications, and other treatments as seen fit by your doctor. A one-sided swelling may indicate vein inflammation (a condition called phlebitis) which you may also need to see a doctor for. Generally speaking, water retention is a temporary, and relatively harmless condition that can fix itself within a few days. However, it can also signal a more serious medical condition if the less worrisome symptoms persist, are severe, or are accompanied by other serious symptoms such as chest pain and cough. Get medical help right away in such a situation. [Image Credit]",0

Man where do I start? The first thing I should address is that I qualify to answer this question because if I live to see August 9th I will be the ripe old age of 60 years. My health is in a bad state due to years of self neglect and abuse. I take 10 pills a day just to survive. I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in November of 2014. So taking into consideration that half the people diagnosed with this are back in the hospital or diseased within six months I should at least say I'm elated to still be here. I have good days and bad, and lately the bad are starting to out number the good. I have to admit I have a low tolerance for noise. I feel the neighbors upstairs and me are at war. Despite my old man demeanor I still seem to be well received with friends and people in general. Don't pity me because I still do just what I want to. I just can't do it as much, and now it seems over doing it often makes me sick the next day. In the end I'm still me! So if I were to offer any advise I'd say take care of yourself it pays dividends later. My mother's birthday is Friday I mailed her card last Thursday to make sure she gets it on time. I tried to walk to the store to get her card and I made it outside the gate to my apartment complex and I couldn't make it any further then one of my neighbors a friend of mine pulled up and took me to the store. I had to sit in his car for a few minutes before going in the store it was my heart. I was able to get the card then he wanted to wait for me to fill it out so he could take me to the office so I could put it in the outgoing mail. I told him I could make it and thanked him. Then on the way back from the office chest pains hit me again. Not saying doom or gloom, just saying you get out what you put in. Gamble if you're like me and you'll probably fall apart like I am. Or take care of yourself, eat right, get your rest and get your exercise, use moderation as a guide. My mom will be eighty three Friday prays God! I my friends don't think I can make it another twenty years.",1

On the right side are located the tricuspid and the pulmonary valve, on the left side are the mitral and the aortic valve. Valves can not move by themselves, but there are opened and closed by the pressures that work on them from both sides. Also the thickness of the valve leaflets play a role in the agility of its movement. The pressures that open and close the valves are build up by the contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle. Diastolic dysfunction somewhat influences the pressures and so can influence the speed at which left and right heart valves open and close. Your regurgitation is very little (trace) and therefore will hardly influence the speed of opening/closing of your valves. Does this help you a little?",0

So a key principle I think here is that this is caused from decrease in compliance of the LV, unlike systolic failure which often leads to increased compliance (fluid overload) This can be caused from LV thickening from aortic stenosis hypertension, aging, whatever. So diastolic function is determined by the relative end diastolic volume in relation to end diastolic pressure and is independent of systolic function by the LV. So with less compliance you are trying to get the same amount in to maintain output so pressure then has to increase. This makes it more difficult to get blood into the left ventricle so pressure increases in the left atrium to be able to drive the blood into the left ventricle and this pressure is transmitted back to the lungs and you get pulmonary hypertension/edema. So unlike systolic dysfunction where end systolic volume is increasing and you are getting volume overload leading to fluid back up into the lungs, here you are getting the pressure gradient (not fluid) backing up into the lungs. Again, by definition EJ fraction has to be normal otherwise that is systolic failure. It's kinda weird cause in reality they often occur together so that is why the stem specified isolated. The fact that they often are mixed actually makes it tough to precisely dx/define for trials. As for LVEDV reducing, that is assuming no compensatory response. The heart will do all it can to maintain CO so the atria here will work harder to get that same volume in even if it means higher pressure. It seems like it would be failing due to the fluid backup but in this case it is a pressure back up, the pressure is higher so the atria need to be at higher pressure to get the fluid in this pressure goes to the lungs since there is no valve between the mitral and pulmonary vasculature and that increased pressure pushed more fluid out into the interstitium (hydrostatic pressure). So the decompositions different, one the pump is failing and fluid is backing up behind it (systolic) the other the pump is working really hard at higher pressure because the ventricle is less complaint and that increased pressure is transmitted through the system and gets to the point where it pushes fluids out into the lungs (diastolic) Hope that helps Sent from my iPhone using SDN mobile app",0
