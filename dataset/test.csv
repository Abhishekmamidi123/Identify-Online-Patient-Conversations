Kevin Ferguson Jr., the oldest son of Kevin Ferguson, already has experience in amateur mixed martial arts. He made his debut in March, where he knocked out his opponent in 83 seconds. The younger Ferguson, 24, signed the Bellator contract before his father?s death in June. ?I was always around the fight business and everything, so I saw it and I understood what was going on? Ferguson said. ?I just knew without a doubt that one day, this was what I wanted to do.? According to Ferguson, he occasionally dabbled in MMA in college, but preferred to ?go out and party? with friends. It wasn?t until recently that he upped his training to go pro. His father fought for Bellator in February, where he defeated Dada 5000. Later the organization discovered Kimbo Slice had taken PEDs and Dada got the win. Kimbo Slice died in June after being hospitalized for congestive heart failure. A large mass was also discovered on his liver. He was 42. ?It was more of a shock to the world, put it like that. It was still a very big tragedy, but I got through it? Ferguson told AP in regards to his father?s untimely death. ?I?m still getting through it. I won?t say I?m over it, but I?m working on it, I guess.? Check out his MMA debut video below:",

That is important because research has found that it can be good for patients? health when physician practices have procedures in place to identify and provide targeted services to patients with chronic conditions and to encourage patients to get involved in actively managing their own care. But physicians were less likely to use those ?care-management processes? with patients who have depression than with those who had other chronic conditions, according to the study in the March edition of the journal Health Affairs. The study analyzed data from the three largest national surveys of physician practices to determine the extent to which they employed five care-management processes between 2006 and 2013. The five processes studied were patient education; patient reminders about preventive care; nurse care managers to coordinate care; feedback on care quality to providers; and disease registries that identify patients with chronic conditions, enabling practices to be proactive about their care. The results were particularly dismal for depression. In the 2012 to 2013 time frame, physician groups on average used fewer than one (0.8) of the care-management processes for their patients with depression, and that level of use hadn?t changed since the 2006 to 2007 period, according to the study. In contrast, practices used 1.7 diabetes care-management processes on average overall with their patients between 2012 and 2013. Among only large practices, the use of diabetes care-management processes grew significantly over time, to 3.2 in 2012-2013. The use of care-management processes for patients with congestive heart failure and asthma was 1.1, a statistically significant difference compared with their use in patients with depression. dStill, Dr. Tara F. Bishop, the lead author of the study and an associate professor in the department of health care policy and research at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City, said those measures were also considered low. The depression results were not surprising, said Bishop. ?There?s a growing understanding that depression and mental illness generally are being undermanaged [in primary care settings] and we?re not using the tools that are available,? she said. It may be that physicians are less comfortable managing psychological illnesses than they are physical ones, but size may also matter, she said. Primary care practices that are part of academic medical centers or integrated health care systems may be better equipped to adopt care-management processes, while smaller, independent practices have trouble marshaling the staff and other resources necessary to put comprehensive care-management techniques to use.

The study involved more than 1,800 Hispanics. They were 45 to 74 years old. They lived in New York City, Chicago, Miami and San Diego. About half had a problem with the blood pumping, known as cardiac dysfunction, the study found. But less than 1 in 20 knew he had the heart problem, the study found. The study appears in the April 5 issue of the journal Circulation: Heart Failure. ""The perception was that Hispanics and Latinos were a group of low risk for cardiac dysfunction, but it is not,"" he said in a news release from the journal's lead author, Dr. Carlos Rodriguez, associate professor medicine and epidemiology at Baptist Medical Center Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. An earlier study involving mostly white people found that one-third had a cardiac dysfunction, the researchers said. The new findings show that doctors should have ""a high level of vigilance"" to monitor the cardiac health of Hispanic patients and a ""low to intensify preventive therapies to avoid the possibility of heart failure in the future threshold"" advised Rodriguez. The sooner it is detected and heart, better, he emphasized dysfunction question. Some research has suggested that the aggressive reduction of risk factors may reverse heart dysfunction. ""As Hispanics and Latinos are the largest ethnic minority in the United States, with more than 51 million people, are likely to have a major impact on the epidemic of heart failure,"" said Rodriguez. The study also found that among those with high rates of risk factors for cardiac dysfunction: half were obese, half were hypertensive, two-thirds had diabetes, two-thirds were inactive, and one fifth were smokers. These risk factors, along with heart attack are the same risk factors for the progression of cardiac dysfunction to heart failure.

Close to two million people every year drag themselves across the finish lines. And that?s just in half marathon races. Runners in these 13.1 mile events have increased six-fold over the past 25 years. All these amateur athletes think they?re getting really healthy as they work themselves up to full marathons. But the truth is they are cutting years off their life. You can see it for yourself if you stand at the finish line of any race. The hardcore runners look terrible. They look gaunt and malnourished. They are hunched over and have a stiff awkward gait. Their complexions are gray and dull. In short, they look really old. In a minute I?ll show you a quick routine that actually reverses that look of aging. But first I want you to see how a marathon habit can add years to your biological age. Effects On The Body Long distance running puts stress on your entire body. Your bones and joints suffer from the continuous impact. Your heart and lungs shrink and lose their reserve capacity. Extended endurance training sends your body the signal to store fat. All of that makes you look and feel old. It can even set you up for a heart attack and early death. 1 Twenty years ago, I provided emergency care for marathon races. I?ve seen thin, young runners collapse with dangerously irregular heartbeats. And most marathon events are marred by reports of not one but several deaths among the runners. A study of marathon runners in the Boston area showed they have high risks for hardening of the arteries, heart attack, and sudden cardiac death. In one Harvard study, doctors drew blood from 80 middle-aged male runners before and after the Boston Marathon. None of the men had any history or heart disease. But one day after the race, they exhibited early signs of cardiac damage similar to the symptoms that appear during a heart attack. Why Is Long Distance Running Bad For You Endurance exercise doesn?t just weaken your heart; it mimics the effects of stress, poor diet, and aging. But short, intense interval training like my PACE program has the opposite effects. The Key To Exercise In the Harvard Health Professionals Study researchers followed more than 7,000 people. They found that the key to exercise is not length or endurance. It?s intensity. The more energy a person exerted during exercise, the lower their risk of heart disease. 2 In another study, intensity turned out to be the key to longevity and reduced risk of death. 3 In fact, studies show that PACE-style workouts slow down your aging clock, boost your energy, and help you heal and repair injuries and disease more quickly. Benefits Of Intense Interval Training Anti-Aging Benefits In a study of 2,400 twins, researchers found that people who did PACE-like exercise had longer telomeres than those who did no exercise or got too much exercise. In fact, their telomeres looked a full 9 years younger. 4 You know by now that telomeres are the protective caps at the end of each strand of your DNA. The longer your telomeres, the younger your cells act. Energy Production PACE also ramps up your energy. You see, short bursts of intense work spark the tiny ?power plants? or mitochondria inside each of your cells. When you?re young you have lots of these generators. But your supply drops off as you age. The key to staying young is creating MORE mitochondria to produce more energy . Swedish researchers studied what happens in muscle cells during bouts of short, high-intensity exercise. 5 They asked a group of people to perform 30 seconds of maximum exertion cycling followed by a brief period of rest. Repeating this just six times triggered the generation of healthy new mitochondria in ALL of the subjects. Boost Stem Cells PACE also boosts your supply of stem cells . Your body uses these healthy master cells to regenerate damaged tissue in any organ from your brain to your heart to your liver. Your reserve of stem cells drops as you age but the right kind of exercise can replenish your supply. A recent study in the European Heart Journal showed that vigorous exercise in mice activated 60% of their cardiac stem cells. After just two weeks of exercise the mice had a seven percent increase in their cardiomyocytes, the ?beating? cells in heart tissue. 6 It works for humans, too. In another study, a simple exercise program made dormant stem cells in the heart leap into action. And amazingly, these new stem cells could help remodel the heart in a group of heart failure patients. 7 Other studies show strenuous exercise can lead to high levels of stem cells in bone, liver, and other organs. These stem cells can morph into exactly the kind of cells your body needs. They have been shown to help heal heart attacks, stroke, skin burns, and nerve damage from toxins. They also prevent infections and repair muscle and tissue damage. Best Anti-Aging Workouts I designed PACE to focus on all these age-reversing strategies. It lengthens telomeres? multiplies mitochondria? and restores stem cells. The best way to achieve these high intensity workouts is to break the activity into short bursts. You can use any activity that will give your heart a bit of a challenge. My favorites are swimming, biking and elliptical machines. Whatever you choose, just remember that the quality of your workout beats the quantity of time you spend doing it. If you have your heart set on running, why not try short sprints instead? Brief sprints increase your lung volume, strengthens your heart, and get you in great shape. Try out this PACE Power workout and you?ll see results in just minutes a day.",

Wait? Can That Be Right? I know what you are thinking? surely this cant be true! For years we have been told by the surgeon general, all medical professionals and even our parents that the worst lifestyle habit you can adopt is smoking; after all ? it has been directly linked to every thing from diabetes to cancer. Ask any non-smoker (even current smokers) and they will all say ?Smoking Isn?t Good For You? (PS. I?ve never met a smoker who wouldn?t enjoy not smoking anymore!) Yet as of 2015 there is a new lifestyle habit that is WORSE THAN SMOKING FOR YOUR HEALTH?. SITTING for prolonged periods of time! (If you sit at your desk for the majority of your work day ? PAY ATTENTION, and stand up!) A new study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that sedentary behavior increase your chance of getting any disease, particularly the ones that kill you prematurely (despite the amount of exercise you do!) Think about this for a moment. You drive to your office (sitting), you sit at your desk most of the day. You drive home (sitting) and then have dinner (sitting) and watch tv (sitting) ? do you see the issue yet?! 80-90% of your day is sitting!!! What Does The Research Say About Prolonged Sitting 1 in 10 premature deaths are the result of inactivity (the same as cigarettes) ~5.3 million of the 57 million deaths in 2014 were attributed to inactivity Primary causes of death are all related to sedentary lifestyle (Heart Disease, Type 2 Diabetes, Breast Cancer & Colon Cancer 10% increase in daily moment (reducing inactivity) = 533,000 deaths/year averted 25% increase in daily movement (reducing inactivity) = 1.3 million deaths/year averted Lack of exercise has been linked to: 20% increase in Heart Disease 30% increase in type 2 diabetes 10% increase in breast and colon cancer 35% increase in high blood pressure.How Prolonged Sitting (8+ hours daily) Affects Your Body Head: Blood clots that form after sitting too long can travel to the brain, causing strokes. Lungs: In individuals who experience heart failure, fluid first backs up in the lungs Arms: Pooling of blood can decrease oxygen to nerves, causing numbness and tingling Stomach: Enzymes in blood vessels responsible for fat benign are shut off, bodies method of metabolizing sugar, protein and fat for fuel is diminished. Sugar/Proteins are converted into fat for storage due to inactivity of metabolism. Neck: Fluid retained in the legs moves to the neck and night and causes snoring, congestion and obstructive sleep apnea. Cervical discs are compressed when sitting and leaning forward causing nerve compression, stiffness, muscle tension and nerve/disc pain. Heart: Has to work harder due to generalized fluid stagnation in extremities due to viscosity increase with stagnation and decreased movement/blood flow Lower Back: Lumbar discs become dehydrated and compressed due to inactivity and gravity load without distribution down the legs if standing/moving. Stiffness, muscle tension and nerve/disc pain. Legs: Fluid collects in the legs during sitting due to gravity and lymphatic compression (weight of upper torso on lower torso/buttock) which would normally be pumped out with movement. Looking at the overall effects prolonged sitting has on the entire body, it becomes easy to see why the researchers believe that sitting is equal to (or worst than) the negative effects smoking has on the body. Now That You Know This ? It?s Time To Take Action By Standing Up! Set an alarm: If you work at a desk where sitting is the primary activity of your day, get into the habit of setting an alarm every hour to stand up for a min or two and do something that moves your body. You can stand up and do some air squats, run in place, stretch, twist etc. Apple Watch Owners: your watch will automatically notify you. Don?t dismiss the alarm and keep sitting ? use it as a reminder to get up for your health! Sit on an air cushion: If your unable to do this, at the minimum sit on a wobble disc or some sort of air cushion that allows you to keep moving while sitting Use a standing desk: If possible suggest to HR or your employer that you would like to have a standing desk installed. This allows you to stand the majority of the day and combat the health issue head on! Get up and move during commercials: If you are watching tv sitting, use every commercial break to get up and walk, do some jumping jacks, pushups or any simple exercise. Use every commercial break and with how many there are you will be fit before your favorite seasons show is over!",

Hello, I am a 20-year-old male, 2 years smoker, been heavy since my early childhood but my overall health has been good nevertheless. Two and a half months ago, I gradually started feeling ""out of it"", constantly slightly dizzy and not having the energy I used to have. Also had a globus throat feeling. I recently (2 months approx.) had an upper endoscopy due to persistent reflux, and it showed nothing particularly dangerous - it showed IM in the antrum and gastritis with some atrophy - by the words of my gastroenterologist, conditions which were very common. Also had an AFP test, it showed only slight raise with 5,36, the upper norm being 5,0 UI/ml. He alarmed me though, for what he thought was base of the tongue polyps, and I became worried that I have cancer. I went to an ENT specialist, had a laryngoscopy and was told that it is just that my lingual tonsil is slightly swollen and irritated. I was relieved, but soon after that I noticed that I'm feeling particularly unwell, and got stressed about it. It didn't help when I discovered that I have lost 5 kg in the past TWO WEEKS, 155 to 150,1 kg (haven't lost so much weight even with a month of dieting!) without changing my eating habits. Week and a half ago I started having episodes of light nausea, and a slight, burning discomfort or pain in my upper abdomen/lower chest. Went to the ER, they did a full blood count, everything was normal, only my creatinine level was lower than normal (even though I eat plenty of protein). Following the advice of my relative who is a nurse, I also had a chest X-ray which, to my relief, showed no tumors, but calcifications in the hiluses, as well as slightly enlarged heart and raised right diaphragm. I also recently saw a great reduction in my appetite, which may or may not be, due to the stress. The past few days I further lost 1,5 kg despite trying to eat a lot to see whether it's from limited food intake and my symptoms continue. I am extremely worried since my web researches strongly point to liver or pancreas cancer, even though it's not statistically likely that I have such a disease. Often, this stress further aggravates some of my symptoms. Could it just be that I'm feeling unwell and rapidly losing weight due to stress, or is it likely that I may have a dangerous disease?",

What are the types of cough? Acute cough has a duration of less than 3 weeks Subacute cough has a duration of 3 - 8 weeks Chronic cough has a duration of more than 8 weeks Productive cough - when you cough up secretions such as mucus, sputum or phlegm Dry cough - when your cough does not procude secretions Causes of Cough Cough lasting less than 3 weeks are often caused by: URTI (upper respiratory tract infection) such as common cold, influenza (flu), and pneumonia Inhaling irritating substance such as smoke, dust and pollen Cough lasting more than 8 weeks (chronic cough) has three most common causes: Postnasal drip syndrome (PNDS) Asthma Acid reflux But causes of cough isn't just limited to those mention above, there may be wide range of culprit such as: Sinusitis Pharyngitis Laryngitis Bronchitis Epiglottitis Croup Tonsillitis Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) Smoking Exposure to allergen GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), choking Side effect of medication such as ACE inhibitors Tuberculosis Tumor Lung cancer Congestive heart failure Whooping cough What are the alternative remedies for cough? HOME REMEDIES FOR COUGH 1. Honey More than just a sweetener, honey acts as a demulcent or a substance that forms a protective coating on the mucous membrane of your mouth to ease pain, inflammation, and irritation cause by cough. The World Health Organization (WHO) pinpoint honey as a demulcent. Honey's use as a home remedy for cough is convenient and relatively safe considering it's worldwide consumption and availability. It can also be taken by children above one year old. It's efficacy in children is valuable considering how cough suppressant medications often cause untoward side effects in the younger population. A study by Evan Ashkin, MD and Anne Mounsey, MD publised on NLM, shows that honey reduces cough frequency and severity. They offer the following recommendation: ""For children older than one year with a viral URI, we can now recommend 1.5 tsp honey to be given prior to bedtime as a cough remedy. This may reduce the use of potentially harmful and often ineffective OTC cough and cold remedies."" Note: Honey is not recommended for children less than 1 year old because of the risk of develping botulism. Also, a study by Shadkam, Mozaffari-Khosravi and Mozayan published on NML concluded that honey is more effective in relieving cough caused by upper respiratory infection (URI) than cough suppresants dextromethorphan (DM) and diphenhydramine (DPH): ""receiving a 2.5-mL dose of honey before sleep has a more alleviating effect on URIs-induced cough compared with DM and DPH doses.""

To avoid going to war, with his fathers help, Brecht registered for a medical course at Munich University, he enrolled there in 1917. He then studied drama there with Arthur Kutscher, this kick-started his passion for the world of theatre. Brecht also wrote newspaper articles while studying with such things as theatre criticisms appearing in his articles. In 1918 Brecht wrote his first full play, Baal. Around 1920/1921, Brecht took a small part in the political cabaret of the Munich comedian Karl Valentin. In Brechts diaries it is recorded that he went to see Valentin perform numerous times . Brecht often compared Valentin to Charlie Chaplin, for his ""virtually complete rejection of mimicry and cheap psychology"". Brecht would later identify Valentin alongside Wedekind and Buchner as his main influences. Between November 1921 and April 1922, Brecht got close and became friends with many influential people in the Berlin cultural scene, one of the people he met was the playwright Arnolt Bronnen, with whom he established a joint venture, the Arnolt Bronnen / Bertolt Brecht Company. In 1922 while still living in Munich, Brecht came to the attention of an influential Berlin critic, Herbert Ihering: ""At 24 the writer Bert Brecht has changed Germany's literary complexion overnight""?he was very enthusiastic in his review of Brechts first produced play, Drums in the Night ?""He has given our time a new tone, a new melody, a new vision. It is a language you can feel on your tongue, in your gums, your ear, your spinal column."" In November it was announced that Brecht had been awarded the prestigious Kleist Prize for his first three plays Baal, Drums in the Night, and In the Jungle. Winning this award really elevated his career and he went on to write many more plays and have a lot of success in his career. Just after Hitler took power in 1933 Brecht left Germany, he then went on to travel to many different cities around the world such as Copenhagen, Paris, Moscow, New York and London for various projects and collaborations. During the war years, Brecht became a main writer of the Exilliteratur (A category of books in the German language written by writers of anti-nazi attitude who fled from Nazi Germany and its occupied territories between 1933 and 1945). He expressed his opposition to the National Socialist and Fascist movements in his most famous plays: Life of Galileo, Mother Courage and Her Children, The Good Person of Szechwan, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, The Caucasian Chalk Circle, Fear and Misery of the Third Reich, and many others. Brecht's only Hollywood script was for the film, Hangmen also die! Brecht passed away on the 14th of August 1956 after suffering a heart attack. It is known that after Brecht away that he suffered from an enlarged heart which led to lifelong chronic heart failure and Sydenham's chorea. ?Brechtian? is a term that is used among theatre practitioners and has become synonymous with production choices that alienate the audience and remind the audience that they are watching theatre, not real life. Epic Theatre proposed that a play should not cause the audience member to identify emotionally with the characters or action on stage, but should instead provoke rational self-reflection and a critical view of the action which is being performed on the stage. My group performing Mother Courage The play we performed at college was Mother Courage, we read the script together as a class to get a clear understanding of the play and to have the opportunity to have a choice of which character you wanted to play. The first couple of weeks were just read-throughs of the script so we could get to grips with our characters and how we should play the character. Once we familiarised ourselves with the script and had learnt it, it was time for us to start rehearsing off book. We didn't have long to rehearse the play before we were supposed to perform so the rehearsals were quite efficient, and since there were 3 groups doing different scenes we all couldn't rehearse together, so we would rehearse by ourselves without direction from Rob. I struggled trying to understand where we were using Brechtian styles within our script, so I found rehearsing for Mother Courage, I think we could've used signs indicating that we had fast-forwarded in time to show the audience what was happening, which is quite Brechtian, we also could've broken the fourth wall and spoke to the audience. I enjoyed the script as I thought it was quite powerful but I feel like if we had more time we could've incorporated more Brechtian techniques into our piece, so I feel like if we were to perform another Brecht play, I could still learn quite a lot.",

My father is stage iv suffering from leiomyosarcoma. He was on chemotherapy and as soon as he had 6th cycle started, infused and came out of the hospital, he felt shortness of breath. A little later, he was okay and drove the car 70 km to home. He then did not feel so good which was normal for us to know because after the chemo infusion, he usually wouldn't feel good for a week. But this time, he was having shortness of breath, went to the local doc who said infection, but he got worsen with shortness of breat the day before his visit to the oncologist for his 6B infusion of chemo. He was having Gemzar/Taxotere. The next day he visited his oncologist who sent him for a test which showed his EF was 45%. He then referred him to the cardiologist who asked for a stress test. After 3 weeks, the results are as below: Suggestive of fixed perfusion defects of mild to moderate degree involving mid anterior and mid to basal inferior segments of left ventricular myocardium. Overall reduced ejection fraction, with dilated LV cavity alongwith transient dilatation (TID: 1.24) and global hypokinesia is suggestive of associated cardiomyopathy. No significant reperfusion is noted in rest study. No other perfusion defect is noted in rest of the myocardial segments. Post-Stress EF: 27%, Rest EF: 37% I am worried about his cancer treatment as it brought it to halt and the oncologist said he can not give him chemo unless EF reaches to at least 50%. The chemo was working great for him, reducing his tumours almost half (including lungs and inguinal area) and we were happy that we might see a complete remission after another 6-7 cycles of chemotherapy. I live thousands of miles away from my dad and I am constantly worried about him. My questions: 1: Is it possible it reverse it, e.g. his EF reaches back to 50% sooner because we are worried about his cancer and he needs chemo? 2: How much time do you think it might take? And is it too much worry for him (and for us, of course)? 3: If you know about chemo breaks, then I need to know if the breaks are okay and the cancer will not affect much during the period he recovers? I really don't know what else to ask but any additional input will be of great help. Thank you very much in advance for your input.

Here?s How It Affects Your Personality,"When you were born may influence your life. In addition to sunnier skies, spring has a way of bringing about sunnier dispositions ? and that?s never more true than for those who are spring babies. This outlook is not some far-fetched astrology reading. Emerging research continues to suggest that your birth season can impact your health and personality. Scientists have examined how it relates to disease risk, creativity and more. Below are a few ways being born during the springtime may affect your health and well-being: You may be less at risk for a mental health disorder. Image Design by Free Pik A 2010 study on mice suggests that those born in the winter were more likely to develop a mental health condition than those born in warmer months. Researchers analyzed the biological clocks ? a factor in mood regulation ? of animals born in the dim light of winter compared to those in brighter seasons. The mice born in the winter seemingly had a greater disruption in their biological clocks later in life. This could possibly explain why people who are born in the winter may be more susceptible to mental illnesses such as seasonal affective disorder, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, according to the researchers. It?s important to reiterate that the study was only conducted in mice, so it?s not entirely conclusive on the effect it may have on humans. However, it does provide interesting insight into how birth order may potentially affect mood and behavior. You may be more optimistic. A brighter season = A brighter outlook? A 2014 study conducted by researchers in Hungary found that people born in springtime were more likely to have a ?hyperthymic temperament,? a characteristic associated with being overly positive. And there are certainly some perks to a glass-half-full mentality. Research suggests optimism can improve your mood and even boost your immune system. But your risk for heart problems is higher. Here?s some bad news: According to a study by data scientists at Columbia University, people who were born in March are more likely to have heart issues, such as atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. The same research also found that July and October babies may be more at risk for asthma, and winter babies may have a higher risk of neurological problems. Making smart choices when it comes to protecting your heart is crucial to living a long life. A balanced diet, exercise and eliminating unhealthy behaviors like smoking are all paramount to protecting yourself against heart disease ? no matter which month you were born. You could be more creative. Your innovative brain might have to do with your birth season, according to data published in the journal Comprehensive Psychology. Researcher Mark Hamilton from the University of Connecticut analyzed more than 300 public figures ? from celebrities and artists to and scientists and politicians ? as a hallmark of creativity. He discovered that the majority of them were born in ?wet? months (think the astrological signs associated with winter and early spring), thus potentially more likely to be creative. You?re more likely to become a leader. Go on, climb that ladder of success. A study conducted by researchers at the University of British Columbia in Canada found that babies born in March and April were more likely to become company leaders than those born in the summer months. The research analyzed 375 CEOs? birthdates from S&P 500 companies between 1992 and 2009. The concept comes down to age and development in school. Those who were born in early spring are likely to be some of the oldest members of their class based on the structure of grades and age, and, thus, the leaders of the pack in a way, according to the research. As study co-author Maurice Levi put it, early success can lead to greater opportunities later in life: Older children within the same grade tend to do better than the youngest, who are less intellectually developed. Early success is often rewarded with leadership roles and enriched learning opportunities, leading to future advantages that are magnified throughout life. Of course, it?s crucial to note all of this research is hardly definitive. There?s no real evidence in any of the studies that suggests there?s a causation, which is needed in order to draw a formal conclusion.

She was 94. Reagan died at her home in Los Angeles of congestive heart failure, according to her spokeswoman, Joanne Drake, of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. ""Mrs. Reagan will be buried at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, next to her husband, Ronald Wilson Reagan, who died on June 5, 2004. Prior to the funeral service, there will be an opportunity for members of the public to pay their respects at the Library,"" Drake said in a statement. The former first lady requested that contributions be made to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Foundation in lieu of flowers, the statement said. Republican party leaders paid tribute Sunday. ""With the passing of Nancy Reagan, we say a final goodbye to the days of Ronald Reagan,"" wrote 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney on Facebook. ""With charm, grace, and a passion for America, this couple reminded us of the greatness and the endurance of the American experiment. ... God and Ronnie have finally welcomed a choice soul home."" As first lady during Ronald Reagan's eight years in the White House, she was known as the ""Just say no"" spokeswoman of anti-drug campaigns, and as a fierce protector of her husband, both personally and politically. When Ronald Reagan was shot in a 1981 assassination attempt, Nancy Reagan never left the hospital where the president was treated until he was released, according to Nancy Reagan's press secretary, Sheila Tate. After she and her husband left Washington, she became his protector again as he struggled with Alzheimer's disease until his death in 2004. After his death, she remained a staunch guardian of his image and legacy. ""She was always the one who kept the flame alive,"" CNN senior political analyst David Gergen, a former Reagan adviser, said Sunday. Her official White House biography quotes her as saying, ""My life really began when I married my husband.""",

HealthDay Stumble Stem cell therapy shows promise for people battling heart failure, a new study finds. The clinical trial found that end-stage heart failure patients treated with stem cells harvested from their own bone marrow had 37 percent fewer cardiac events than those who received a ""dummy"" placebo. ""For the last 15 years, everyone has been talking about cell therapy and what it can do. These results suggest that it really works,"" study author and cardiac surgeon Dr. Amit Patel, director of Cardiovascular Regenerative Medicine at the University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City, said in a university news release. Another expert was cautiously optimistic about the results. While the findings are promising, ""further long-term data -- and hopefully improved levels of heart efficiency and performance -- would still need to be seen,"" said Dr. David Friedman, chief of heart failure services at Northwell Health Long Island Jewish Valley Stream Hospital. In heart failure, a weakened or damaged heart no longer pumps blood the way it should. This potentially fatal disease affects about 5.7 million Americans, according to the American Heart Association. The new study involved 126 heart failure patients . Sixty received the stem cell treatment , while the other 66 got a placebo. After one year, 4 percent of the stem cell therapy patients had died and about 52 percent had been hospitalized for heart failure . That was an improvement on the group receiving the placebo, where 8 percent of patients died and more than 82 percent ended up in the hospital, Patel's team said. ""This is the first trial of cell therapy showing that it can have a meaningful impact on the lives of patients with heart failure,"" Patel added. If further studies are successful, stem cell therapy may one day offer an alternative to current treatments for end-stage heart failure, such as heart transplantation and left ventricular assist device therapy, the researchers said. The study was published online April 4 in The Lancet journal and presented simultaneously at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) in Chicago. There was other potentially good news from the ACC meeting for heart failure patients. On Sunday, a 10-year study led by researchers at Duke University found that bypass surgery plus medication appears to work better for heart failure patients, compared to the use of medications alone. The study involved more than 1,200 patients with severe heart disease and heart failure who were tracked for about a decade. All of the patients got standard heart drugs, but those who also underwent coronary bypass lived a median of 16 months longer. They also suffered fewer heart attacks, strokes and hospitalizations, the study found. ""This now demonstrates that the advantages of [bypass] are robust and durable and the procedure saves and extends lives,"" study author Dr. Eric Velasquez, heart failure specialist at the Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, N.C., said in a university news release.

The work with U.S. drugmaker Amgen on Alzheimer's will focus on finding a medicine that can be given orally, rather than as an injection, through the development of so-called BACE inhibitor drugs. For migraine, the collaboration will focus on Amgen's experimental drugs AMG 334, currently in Phase III, and AMG 301, in Phase I. Novartis will have global co-development rights and commercial rights outside North America and Japan. Novartis will fund disproportional migraine R&D expenses for a period and will pay Amgen double-digit percentage royalties on sales. BACE inhibitors work by blocking an enzyme called beta secretase that is involved in production of beta-amyloid, a protein that creates brain plaques considered a major cause of Alzheimer's. Other companies such as Eli Lilly, Biogen and Roche are developing injectable antibody drugs to target beta-amyloid, which have shown some promise in clinical trials. LONDON Novartis and Amgen are joining forces in the hunt for an Alzheimer's http://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/anesthesiology/pain-management treatment, in the latest sign that drugmakers believe an effective therapy for the memory-robbing disease may be within reach. Swiss-based Novartis said on Tuesday the alliance was part of a drive to build up its portfolio in neuroscience, following other deals this summer that have expanded the company's presence in pain relief and multiple sclerosis. Under the Alzheimer's deal, Amgen will pay an undisclosed upfront payment and milestone payments as well as disproportional research and development costs for a period, followed by a 50/50 cost and profit share arrangement. The product is relatively late to the party, since Merck already has a BACE inhibitor in Phase III development, with data expected in 2017, while AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly started a large Phase II/III study in December. But Novartis believes CNP520 has a particularly attractive profile and could potentially avoid some of the side effects seen with some other BACE products, such as fluid build-up. Novartis' experimental compound CNP520, currently in early Phase I/IIa studies, will be the lead BACE inhibitor molecule. CNP520 is planned to be included in a prevention study in people with a genetic risk of developing Alzheimer's, in collaboration with the Banner Alzheimer's Institute in the United States. BACE inhibitors would be more convenient, since they are pills, and they also offer an opportunity to intervene earlier in the disease process -- but they are further behind in development and have yet to prove themselves in clinical trials. But it also has an important presence in multiple sclerosis (MS) with Gilenya and the company last month moved to expand its MS business by buying the remaining rights to ofatumumab from GlaxoSmithKline. The two companies also plan to collaborate in developing new medicines for migraine.

She is then sentenced to recreate the device with the money of a Japanese philanthropist who's cancer has recently gone into remission. After going through the worm hole machine successfully, the alien race who sent them the schematics tells her that it is not yet time for her race to travel the stars. She then instructs the Japanese to deconstruct the worm hole device. Unfortunately, during the deconstruction of the first device, a second device explosively manifests on the coast of Florida. The explosion also brought into being a religious fundamentalist who believed that God wanted the device to exist. Also brought into existence where a science team, world class engineers, and an astronaut who was considered the best choice to make first contact (despite the fact that this had already happened). During the next several months, a board consisting of scientific, cultural, and religious leaders would question our main woman, the astronaut, and eventually several more candidates for first contact before eventually giving up and disassembling the worm hole machine. Now the POTUS Bill Clinton comes in to ask that the schematic of the machine be heavily encrypted into a 3D form. With the help of the Japanese philanthropist, who has completely gone into remission from his birthing cancer, the leading woman is able to convert the 3D encryption into a 2d format. Over the corse of a month this data is encrypted more and more by a team of misfits known as SETI, and eventually shot out into space in the form of prime numbered thumps. At the beginning of the transmission our scientists are all confused, and our lead woman gets really excited about the loss of this data. Eventually no one even believes that aliens or this code exist and SETI is moved to Brazil with the hope of the explosion astronaut. Our film is finalized by a flashback to our scientist childhood where she asks aliens for a father, and after finding out who her father will be, has a very depressing father shower. The father is born into the world via heart failure, and they all live happily ever after.",

Also many prescriptive medications affect our body?s stores of Coenzyme Q10 and can rapidly deplete it. This molecule is particularly of benefit for energy, metabolism and heart health. Low levels are associated with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) an early indicator for heightened risk for heart disease. Another marker for inflammation gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) an early marker for heart failure and NT-proBNP and are associated with low levels of CoenzymeCQ10. When you supplement this nutrients these markers go down. For adequate absorption it is important to have good health fat and you do not have iron toxicity (high ferritin levels). Vitamin D deficiency will affect the production and absorption of this vital nutrient so make sure you have adequate levels of this as well preferably between 40 and 60 ng/ml. CoenzymeQ10 can be taken orally and can also be done by injection for immediate change in the system for those who have extremely have markers on their labs. Talk with your health care professional about your specific needs and levels today.",

A few days ago it came to my attention that my friend, former partner, and OG scooter rider/industry figure Steven Tongson, needed some help from the scooter community. His mother Susan, the woman who bought him his first scooter, who supported him his entire time involved with scootering, has been diagnosed with severe congestive heart failure. This condition has no cure, and the doctors have given her 2-5 years to live...devastating news to Steven and his brother, the sons she raised alone. The good new is that, with a full heart transplant, she can continue to be an amazing mom to her kids as well as a grandmother to Steven's three year old boy. It's no question how much Steven has helped out the industry. From managing various teams, running a shop, all his work here at Inside, to just being a friend, Steven has given so much to so many people in this community. All while being extremely humble and not expecting anything in return. To help out his mom, he created a GoFundMe to take donations. What he's asking for is everyone to simply share the link, and to donate if it's financially possible for you. In his own words- ""... I am coming to you, not looking for your financial help, because I know we all have our own financial situations. Simply sharing my GoFundMe Campaign on your social media sites would mean a lot. However, donations, if you are capable, would also be greatly appreciated. Our goal right now is to try and get my Mom on the list to get a new heart. She has been crippled by medical bills from the various hospital stays during the past two years. She has lost her house, and believe me when I say her three children, and her family, are all doing what we can to help her situation."" So now, I'm going to challenge you, the scooter community, to see how far we can spread this. A share on Facebook, a repost on Instagram, a link on Twitter, anything will help. If anyone deserves our help, it's Steven. Thanks to all who've read this through and contribute. https://www.gofundme.com/cwspash8",

Around 100,000 people will benefit from using the drug sacubitril valsartan, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said after recommending the drug for some NHS patients. The drug helps people with heart failure manage their symptoms which can include: shortness of breath; swelling of the feet, stomach and lower back; and fatigue. Heart failure happens when the heart muscle cannot pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body and it affects over half a million people in the UK. Nice said that giving out the drug to patients, which costs ?3 a day, could mean than there are 30,000 fewer hospital admissions in England because of heart failure. It could also prevent deaths, the health body said. The drug will be made available to those whose hearts are only able to pump a reduced amount of oxygenated blood around the body and whose instances of heart failure are not controlled by the commonly used drugs, ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Sacubitril valsartan, manufactured by Novartis, is the first of a new kind of drug. It works by widening the blood vessels and increasing blood flow while reducing blood pressure and taking the strain off the heart. "" We are pleased to be able to recommend this innovative new treatment for those people with a severely reduced ejection fraction (when a heart is only able to pump a reduced amount of oxygenated blood around the body) and whose symptoms can mean they are almost constantly bedbound,"" said Professor Carole Longson, director of Nice's Health Technology Evaluation Centre. ""This recommendation will help ease the symptoms of very ill people, improve their quality of life and help them to take part in normal daily activities. It should also reduce their need for hospital treatment."" Commenting on the news, Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""There is currently no cure for heart failure and we welcome the news that this drug will now be available to some patients to help control and manage their condition. ""In the UK over half a million people are living with this crippling illness which can cause chronic breathlessness and fatigue, leaving patients with a long and difficult fight for life."" Share:",

Without knowing much about your brother it's hard to tell but if he's a heavy pot smoker and/or cigarette smoker as well as following a bad diet and doesn't exercise it sounds like plaque build ups in the arteries lead to his blockages. 40% means there is a lot of plaque still there and the medication he is on will break that up progressively. He is not out of the woodworks until he achieves maximum cardiac function that he can and then they can evaluate how bad the damage truly is. They may have a rough idea now but it's all a matter of time and him making lifestyle changes. Now with that being said, he can be very healthy, exercise, and a light smoker and still have a heart attack. There is many other factors and diseases our bodies encounter that can lead to such clots and blockages. So again, without knowing much about your brother, from an outsider POV this sounds like a habit related incident due to plaque build up of the coronary arteries. It happens, and is happening more often with the rise of poor health habits across the world.",

Increasing the cell concentration in the blood makes it more viscous and harder for the heart to pump. If the volume is elevated, it also puts a large amount of strain on the heart to pump.

It was a rough week, but didn't end up on the hospital this time, so that's improvement! My liver enzymes were elevated, so they lowered one one of the three doses of chemo by 25% just to be safe. Also didn't do a shot that I did last time called Neulasta. It's given day after chemo to help the body start making white blood cells sooner that it would on it's own to prevent chances of infection. Since I didn't tolerate the first treatment of chemo/neulasta well and we aren't sure what caused it, we decided not to do the shot this time around to see if that helps. So far I've felt better than I did the first time, so that may have helped, but it's hard to tell. Just grateful it's not as bad. I finally got the rest of my chemo treatment plan. I am doing 3 rounds of FEC which is the combo of 3 chemos I'm doing now, so I've got 2 down and 1 more to go. Then I'll switch to a chemo called taxotere which hopefully my body will tolerate much better than the chemo I'm doing now. It also has less serious side effects. The one I'm doing now induce permanent menopause, heart failure and even leukemia (very rare but possible), so it will be good to switch over to the one that doesn't have such serious side effects as this. The last treatment of chemo should be the last week in July, as long as nothing changes, so I'm glad to have a plan in place! After chemo, I'll continue with an infusion (Herceptin) through my port every 3 weeks for a year that helps with a protein that's found in my cancer. It's not as serious as chemo, so my doctor says I should tolerate it well. The side effects are manageable. I've also been seeing the rehab therapist weekly since my surgery to help me gain back my range of motion and strength in my arm. I'm just about there. I can finally raise my arm above my head and looks like I will see her one more week and then I'll be good to work on it at home on my own. I may not ever have the range I had before surgery, but I will work on it to get the best results. A week ago on fast Sunday I decided to shave the remaining amount of hair I had off since it was coming out so quickly. My sister and her boys come over all to help. It was fun to involve the kids. Made it feel less traumatizing for me. I was well enough to attend sacrament meeting afterwards, and I'm so glad I did. I felt a rejuvenation of spirituality that I really needed, but I also witnessed a very sweet and sincere testimony from a little boy that made my heart burst. He was the cutest went up all by himself. At the very end of his sweet testimony he said ""and please bless the woman with cancer that she will feel better."" I couldn't hold back the tears! They just kept flowing down my face. Even well after the testimony I was still crying. Even though I've lost my hair before, after it was all shaved off, I was really feeling bad about myself and it was just one of those days where I felt nothing looked good on me. Hearing those exact words really touched my heart and put my heart in the right place. I hear ""Praying for you"", ""You are in my prayers"" often, but to actually witness a little boy pray for me with such faith and sincerity, was overwhelmingly touching. It also confirmed to me that I really do have so many people praying for me. Sometimes it's hard to tell if people are just saying kind words to bring me comfort or if people really do include me in their daily prayers and this confirmed it for me. I think that's why it hit me so hard. Thanks to the beautiful Mother that is teaching your sweet children the power of prayer. You know who you are and I already have a deep love for you and your children in the short amount of time we've known each other. Mother's Day was yesterday. It was the best day I've had all week. Had some delicious homemade waffles topped with fresh cut fruit. Also had some very heartwarming tear jerking letters from Tanner and Kaydence, along with some goodies and a massage gift card. Then spent the day visiting my amazing Mom and my other amazing Mom (Tanner's Mom). Also got to take a few photos with my sweetheart and I. She amazes me! She pushes me to be strong. She makes me fight harder when I don't feel like fighting. She makes me feel beautiful with or without hair. She has stepped as a mini-Mom in our household. She takes such good care of me from helping me up the stairs, getting me water, rubbing my feet, to singing me to sleep. I love this sweetheart to the moon and back. Words cannot describe the sweet relationship we have. She is my best friend and I am honored to be her Mother. She is going to be a great mother one day and I look forward to witnessing it, even though I don't want her to grow up. She will always be my sweet, sensitive, caring, thoughtful, honest, determined, smart, little baby.",

Heart Surgery Hospitals in India do this surgery to treat the complications of coronary artery bypass grafting, to treat the congenital heart disease from various causes including endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease and atherosclerosis. Heart diseases are increasing in India due to change in lifestyle, rich diet and lack of physical exercise, however, nowadays heart related problems are not the life-threatening disease if the proper medical care is given to the heart patients. Heart Surgery India treats the disease affecting by organs inside the chest and lungs diseases. Heart Surgery Cost in India is around 70% less than the cost in the western countries and due to this large number of international patients comes to India for Heart Surgery India every year. The main aim of Heart Surgery India is to bring the highest standard of personal and medical care along with the clinical research, education and training in India. Types of Heart Surgery India ? Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG): It is the type of the Heart Surgery India which improves the flow of blood in the heart. Heart Surgery Hospitals in India use the CABG surgery to treat the patients suffering from coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD is a disease in which a fatty substance builds up in the heart is known as plaque. CABG is one of the best types of open heart surgery which improves the quality of life and reduces the symptoms of CHD in patients. ? Beating Heart Surgery: Beating Heart Surgery is also known as the off-pump coronary artery bypass which has been proven a safe Heart Surgery India. Both Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass and traditional bypass surgery are beneficial for the patients of heart. Some of its benefits are stated as below: ? A lower risk of heart stroke ? Lower death rate ? Less need for transfusion ? Reduced injury to the heart ? Shorter stay in the hospital Minimally Invasive Coronary Artery Surgery: It is a newly advanced technique of performing coronary artery disease. This Heart Surgery India can be performed through the 3""-5"" incision placed between the ribs. This surgery results in a faster recovery, less pain and fewer complications after the Heart Surgery India. Thoracic Surgery: This Heart Surgery India performs on the lungs, heart, chest etc. The malignancies should be removed from the lungs and esophagus through a surgical operation.

Most of the heart transplant surgeries are done with the patients who are on the last stage of heart failure. Heart Valve Surgery: This Heart Surgery India is used to replace the diseased heart valve. The blood should flow through the heart valve which flows from the different chambers of the heart. The blood which flows out of the heart into large arteries should also flow through from heart valve. Source :- http://heartsurgeryinindia.tumblr.com/post/140323767948/best-cardiac-surgery-in-india",
66,FORUMS,www.alsearsmd.com,http://www.alsearsmd.com/2016/04/better-than-aspirin-for-your-heart/,4/1/2016,10:57:00,4/1/2016 20:27,Better than Aspirin for Your Heart,"Health Articles Better than Aspirin for Your Heart Better than Aspirin for Your Heart 0 0 0 0 0 If you?ve been diagnosed with heart disease , the chances are you?ve been told to take low-dose aspirin every day as a preventative measure against heart attack and stroke. It?s most commonly prescribed for patients with congestive heart failure. This is the inability of your heart to pump as much blood as your body needs. And this is a big worry to me, because there is very little evidence that aspirin helps. In fact, regular use of aspirin ? even baby aspirin ? can do you more harm than good. Common Aspirin Beliefs The idea is that aspirin thins the blood, making it easier to pump. It is also said to prevent clots from forming in coronary arteries and reduce the chances of other heart-related problems. But a recent study of 8,000 heart disease patients who took 75 mg of aspirin per day saw no improvement in mortality rates. 1 The researchers, from Gentofte University Hospital, in Copenhagen, concluded: ?Routine use of aspirin in heart failure might cause more harm than benefit.? You see, the occasional aspirin may be fine if you have a headache, but regular use of aspirin for your heart is extremely unsafe. In a minute, I?m going tell you about three of the best, natural ways to boost your heart. But first, let?s take a look at just how unsafe it is to take an aspirin every day? What Are the Risks of Taking Aspirin Every Day? One of the greatest risks is internal bleeding. Studies show that long-term, low-dose aspirin therapy may even double your risk for gastrointestinal bleeding . 2 And if you have congestive heart failure, you have an even greater risk of internal bleeding, the Danish researchers revealed. I?ve been warning my patients for years about the dangers regular use of painkillers like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen . These over-the-counter drugs claim more than 16,000 lives every year. 3 Regular intake aspirin can also cause: Stroke Pancreatic cancer Kidney failure You see, mainstream medicine prescribes aspirin because it ignores the real problem of failing hearts ? they?re starved of energy. Benefit from These Heart-Healthy Nutrients I offer my patients a powerful cocktail of three nutrients that can help your heart metabolize energy by going straight to the biochemistry that fuels our cells: Nutrient #1: CoQ10. This nutrient and antioxidant is a high-octane fuel used by every cell in your body to power everything it does. CoQ10 is essential for the normal function of all your vital organs ? especially energy-hungry organs, like your heart. Your mitochondria ? the tiny power plants within each of your cells ? need CoQ10 to produce the energy they run on. And decades of research have linked low levels of CoQ10 with congestive heart failure. You see, your heart ? because of its high-energy ? needs a lot of CoQ10. Some of the best sources of CoQ10 are beef, chicken and fish . But if you?ve been taking statins, your levels are likely to be very low and I recommend taking it in supplement form. If you are over 30 and in good health, I strongly recommend you take 30 mg of CoQ10 daily. If you are over 60 , increase your CoQ10 dosage to 60 mg daily. If you have heart disease, high blood pressure, gingivitis, memory loss, chronic fatigue or are taking statins, increase to at least 100 mg a day. And be sure it?s the right CoQ10. The more common form is called ubiquinone. But it?s the ubiquinol form that?s the most potent . Ubiquinol carries an extra electron and is eight-times more powerful than ubiquinone. Nutrient #2: Omega-3s. One of the best ways to treat poor circulation and stabilize your blood pressure is with omega-3 rich krill oil. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation throughout the body, and are especially important for repairing damage to your blood vessels. I always recommend combining krill oil with natural astaxanthin , a powerful antioxidant that can help DHA cross the blood-brain barrier even more efficiently. Take at least 500 mg of DHA and 60 mg of EPA from a combination of squid oil and krill oil with astaxanthin. And make sure you take them with meals so these omega-3 fatty acids can be digested properly. Nutrient #3: D-ribose. This is a naturally occurring carbohydrate found in every living cell in the body. Without it, cells can?t produce energy. And it is utterly essential to the energy levels of the muscular tissue in the heart. Numerous studies show that D-ribose improves the heart?s ability to relax, known as its diastolic function. With better relaxation, it has more power to pump blood to the rest of the body. Researchers at the University of Bonn in Germany recently carried out a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with D-ribose. And while significant improvements were found in the group that took D-ribose, no improvements were found in the group that took the placebo. 4 For anyone with heart disease, I recommend boosting your energy metabolism with a supplement . Based on the success of two major studies, I recommend 5 grams of powdered D-ribose three times a day. 5,6 Mix each dose of D-ribose in an 8 oz glass of water or juice and then drink it all down at breakfast, lunch and dinner. 1.

The major factors which increases the burden of this disease are lifestyle habits such as physical inactivity, smoking and unhealthy diet. These factors which result in obesity and hypertension are also identified as the underlying cause of cardiovascular disorders. The number of people diagnosed with coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, pulmonary embolism and congenital heart disease is rising rapidly worldwide. Therefore, the need for preventive healthcare has arisen and realized by countries with high burden of these disorders. Thus, the demand for cardiovascular monitoring and diagnostic devices is expected to rise in such countries. Aging is one of the major factors driving the demand for cardiovascular monitoring and diagnostic devices. As the aging process advents, the risk of hypertension, weakening of heart muscles, obesity and diabetes grows, thus increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, advent of new technologies enabling portability in handling and performing the test will drive the global cardiovascular monitoring and diagnostic devices market further. For example, technologies such as implantable loop recorders and wearable heart rate monitors would compel other players in the market to pace up with their product technologies, which will fuel the market growth. Based on the product type, the global cardiovascular monitoring and diagnostic devices market is categorized into six segments namely ECG systems, cardiovascular diagnostic catheters, holter monitors, event monitors, implantable loop recorders and ECG management systems. Among these, ECG systems held the majority share of the global cardiovascular monitoring and diagnostic devices market in 2012, while the global market for implantable loop recorders is expected to grow at a faster pace during the forecast period. The ECG systems market is majorly dominated by the resting ECG systems owing to higher demand from customers due to convenience in the procedure. The demand for these systems will rise further owing to their lower price and rising demand from patients. Also, it is more convenient to be used among elderly patients and patients at high risk of congestive heart failure. Get a Sample for this Report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=2385 Geographically, the global cardiovascular monitoring and diagnostic devices market is categorized into four regions namely, North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Rest of the World (RoW). North America dominated the global cardiovascular monitoring and diagnostic devices market in 2012 due to high patient awareness coupled with the presence of sophisticated healthcare infrastructure. Also, the adoption of new technologies is rapid in this region which results in high demand for advanced cardiovascular monitoring and diagnostic devices. Conversely, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow at a higher CAGR, owing to the high presence of unmet healthcare needs, high patient population and increasing healthcare expenditure. The global cardiovascular monitoring and diagnostic devices market is characterized by the presence of few big players such as GE Healthcare, Philips Healthcare, Boston Scientific Corporation, Siemens Healthcare, Nihon Kohden Corporation, St. Jude Medical, Inc. and Welch Allyn, Inc. Competition is high among these players which compels them to seek for new technologies and devices providing accurate and convenient testing.",

When people are talking about a sudden weight gain of 10-14 lbs. in a week or two that can't be contributed to diet (i.e. consuming lots of calories), then it absolutely ISN'T normal.

We can?t guarantee 24-hour cover but we will try our utmost (District Nurse). The issue of resources is further examined below. Barriers to ACP Inadequate resourcing was identified as a key barrier to the implementation of ACP. Nurses perceived that ACP could only be implemented authentically if there were adequate services and resources in place to engage with ACP, to support any choices that patients might record for their future care towards the end of life and provide support to family carers. The nurses below are reflecting on patients? choices for care at home and in a hospice respectively: ? you can try and get the services together and coordinate them, but often they?re not there. And I think people can manage very well at home if that?s where they want to die as long as we?ve got the services to keep them at home and to support them (Macmillan Nurse). Certainly, around heart failure at the minute we do struggle for palliative care support. There isn?t a specific unit that patients can go into. When they talk about the hospice, there?s actually only day care hospice. X Hospice is only for cancer patients (Heart Failure Nurse Specialist). A further barrier to ACP perceived by the nurses was a widespread lack of knowledge among the general public, patients and their family members about the availability of help and support during illness and end-of-life care, and a contemporary tendency to not think about one?s reaction to serious illness until it actually http://www.selleckchem.com/products/PD-0332991.html occurs: People don?t know ? what they want until they?re in that situation. Because often people will say to me I didn?t know there were all these services out there (Macmillan Nurse). Nurses also perceived that patients and the public lacked knowledge about the course and outcome of common life-limiting conditions. This created a further barrier to ACP conversations, since many patients perceived they were irrelevant to their situation. More generally, nurses perceived that patients had many fears Cilengitide about death and illness, which combined to create a taboo surrounding the subject. Fears identified included being frightened of death; fears about going into hospital; about being alone and dying alone. These were all perceived as creating barriers to discussion and yet nurses described how fears could be alleviated once patients were encouraged to put into words what they were most worried about: And it?s also sort of about unpicking why people are ?",

FDA Alert,"A safety review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has shown that medications containing saxagliptin and alogliptin may increase the risk of heart failure in patients who already have heart or kidney disease. Popular medications that contain those ingredients include Onglyza? (saxagliptin), Kombiglyze XR (saxagliptin and metformin), Nesina? (alogliptin), Kazano? (alogliptin and metformin), and Oseni? (alogliptin and pioglitazone). Saxagliptin and alogliptin are dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor drugs indicated to lower blood sugar in adults with type-2 diabetes when used with diet and exercise. The FDA noticed the increased risk when examining two clinical trials for patients with heart disease. The trials noticed an increased heart failure risk of 25% for patients taking saxagliptin over a placebo and an increased heart failure risk of 18% for patients taking alogliptin over a placebo. Patients who have a history of heart disease should not take or stop taking any medications without first talking to their doctor. Patients taking these drugs should contact their doctor if they experience any symptom of heart failure, including shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, fatigue, or weight gain with swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, or stomach.

I've paid $9.49 every bi-wkly pay period for STD Insurance, and $9.85 every bi-wkly pay period for LTD Insurance for nearly 7 yrs to keep myself protected. My claim was denied on Apr 19th and has been kept on hold. I was told yesterday I don't meet their definition of hypertension, that's one of the issues I'm experiencing as the result of the others. I was told it would have to be 160/100. I'd like to see the Cardiologist that supports that. My BP has been 145/101, 139/89, etc...If that's not considered high, wonder why the Cardiologist I was sent to put me on BP meds immediately. When 1 med didn't do the trick, another med was added to the regimen. I'm going to let him know how incompetent he is, how dare him start me on drugs. What does he think he's doing? Trying to get me addicted to living? Mindful or mindless? Nevermind that I was diagnosed with Class II heart failure in 2012 after having an angiogram. So right now I have some sort of infection going on that the lab work shows white blood count cell +5000, blood in the urine, excessive to severe edema, maintained elevated BP for the past couple months. I'm told their notes don't reflect that. I was sitting right there when the BP was taken and blood drawn. I've spoken with the Dr.'s offices, they said they sent everything that was asked for. I was told yesterday that it would be at least another 10 days for THEIR Dr.'s to review whatever they have. One Specialist wrote my kidneys, liver, and bladder need to be evaluated to determine the source of the infection and blood. But since the claim was denied right out of the gate that's never happened. I should have already been treated and back to work weeks ago. I've not seen a Dr., nor been treated since Apr, it's now June. It's not conducive to a healthy outcome when treatments are delayed when the inexperienced, uneducated get to call the shots if we get the benefits and services we've paid for. If they have questions in submissions they need to go directly to the sources for clarification, not the patients, it's their job. The smart ass girl that has my appeal thinks I should be at work running up and down ladders all night at work. I work 9P - 5:30A. My employer doesn't pay us for sleeping like the Princess. We're paid to produce results. But if I were to go back before this is under control I put myself at risk of serious injury or death, and place my employer at risk of liability. Not a good situation. Now I see why they were dropped as providers. I've filed additional complaints with the Federal Trade Commission #73076236 and Insurance  Fraud NAIC 1972677187. They've been sued before for fraud, and lost. I intend to keep going until something is done about this. This hurts people and can destroy lives.""",

Sometimes this is a wrong move since the pains are an indicator of a more complex medical condition. A painful irritation in itself is not a sickness, but the resultant effect is sometimes a disease. A visit to a pain doctor Houston professional is the ultimate step that you should take to verify whether your discomfort is indicative. This article expounds on some of the pains that are indicative. One of the pains that you should not overlook is severe morning headache. A mild headache can go unnoticed, but a severe headache denotes an acute health issue such as a brain tumor. The condition is rare. Therefore, you should not think of a brain tumor every time your head hurts in the morning. The incidence of a primary brain tumor is usually below one percent. Ulcers are some medical conditions that a severe stomach ache denotes. Besides having the stomach ache, one also spots blood in the stool, and whenever one gets a meal, the stomachache goes down or out. The pains come in the form of a burning feeling that occurs between the breastplate and the navel. A specialist can rule out the main cause of the stomach ache if you make a prompt visit to a health center. Blood clots and congestive heart failure have a common sign where one experiences discomfort on legs. The earlier sign is a swelling and painful discomfort on one leg whereas the other sign is swelling in both legs. Blood clots come after one has a recent surgery or rests for a long time. Traveling on a plane or a car sometimes also results in having a blood clot. A painful irritation in the back at night is the other health issue to watch. The irritation is usually so severe that it wakes you up. While it is possible to rule out wearing and tearing of the body as the main cause of the pain, having a history of cancer or fever for a person having such back pains necessitates a visit to a specialist. Additionally, having a penetrative back discomfort indicates that you could be having hardening arteries. Therefore, you should visit a specialist for a checkup. Several people live with diabetes without their knowledge since they ignore having pins and needles feeling in their feet. There is usually a resultant numbness after having the feeling, and you should have yourself checked for diabetes. Having the discussed signs does not necessarily mean that you have the medical conditions that are associated with them. However, it is only a doctor who can confirm the nature of the resultant medical conditions that the pains indicate. Therefore, you should make a visit to a specialist to have the pains examined.

For the second consecutive year, Latifah and her mom, Rita Owens, are teaming up with the American Heart Association?s ?Rise Above Heart Failure? initiative to raise awareness about heart failure. As part of the initiative?s ?Red Steps Challenge,? Latifah and Owens ? who was diagnosed with congestive heart failure over 10 years ago ? are calling on six million Americans to take six million ?red steps? in their favorite pair of red socks in recognition of six million Americans living with heart failure. For Latifah, reuniting with the non-profit organization is ?very important? and needs to be addressed by more people. ?Heart failure affects six million Americans, and it has the potential to affect a lot more,? Latifah said during an interview with The Huffington Post. ?We feel like there?s certain small steps that you can take to prevent it, as well as manage it if you have it. So that?s why it?s important to get the word out. And it?s something that my mom has been dealing with, so this initiative is just something that we?ve been wanting to do together.? According to the American Heart Association, being physically active and choosing a healthy diet ? including foods low in saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium ? are among the ways to decrease the risk of heart disease and stroke. Upon discovering her mother?s diagnosis, the multi-hyphenated mogul says it was imperative for her entire family to band together to alter their daily lifestyle habits. ?My mom wasn?t the only one who decreased her salt intake, we as a family did,? she said. ?Getting more exercise was one thing, but if we?re cooking dinner, we?re not cooking dinner for one person, we?re cooking for the whole family. So we cut that down. Also in the preparation of our food, adding more fruit, adding more vegetables, more healthy drinks, decreasing the sugar intake. All of those things affect us. So just changing one person?s diet in the family wound up changing the whole family?s diet, which helps all of us.? In addition to being an advocate for healthy living in America, Latifah also wants her message to extend into the hip hop community. With the recent health-related passing of close friend and A Tribe Called Quest member, Phife Dawg, the 46-year-old encourages today?s artists to raise awareness in their music ? similar to some of her peers from the early 90s. ?We?ve always had the power. What I want to see is the newer generation of artists who are coming out to really start speaking about things like we did,? she said. ?We made party records, which we knew how to make and make really well, but we also talked about things that were going on in our communities. And it?s so important that the young voices start doing that more. Don?t be afraid to make a record about what you see happening right around you. Because for our generation of hip hop, we were able to impact things like apartheid in South Africa.? The award-winning actress went on to add that the late rapper?s death should also be used as a reminder to support those dealing with health-related issues. ?I know Phife fought a long, long tough fight for a long time. But this should just let people know that none of us are immune to real life,? she said. ?Tell the people you love that you love them right now. Also, if you see something that?s more destructive, be a support to them. Don?t be judge and jury to them; be a support system to those in your life who are dealing with situations, because they need your support.?

Especially if you are older and unable to regulate your blood pressure to normal. A study conducted on 2,000 seniors published their results in the Archives of Internal Medicine. High blood pressure- hypertension is life threatening. It affects the arteries, kidneys and the body in general. It can lead to heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure and many more dangerous problems. Doctors usually give aggressive therapy when it comes to hypertension because it is very dangerous. A particular method cannot apply to everyone. So there are different treatments for 50 and 80 year olds. How to diagnose hypertension? The process of regulating and normalizing blood pressure starts by screening the blood pressure from the age of 20 in regular timelines to once every 2 years. This specific rule applies to people whose blood pressure is lower than 120/80 mm Hg. The blood pressure is proportional with the heartbeats. If they raise the blood pressure rises, if they drop the blood pressure drops as well. It varies from posture, physical activity, stress and sleep. For young people at the age of 20 and over the normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg, less than 120 systolic and 80 diastolic. The results show that one in three adults suffer from blood pressure in the US. If the blood pressure is higher the doctors need to repeat the measurements so that they can give proper treatment. Sometimes the patient can monitor their blood pressure at home before being diagnosed with high blood pressure. If your blood pressure measures show 140/90 mm Hg or higher, where the systolic 140 or more and diastolic 90 or more, the doctor may start you on a program. Usually the programs are consisted of lifestyle and diet changes, and maybe even prescribed drugs that can help regulate the blood pressure. You need to rest for several minutes if you have a blood pressure that is 180 mm Hg systolic value and 110mm Hg diastolic value. If the high blood pressure value remains you need to seek medical help. Even if your blood pressure is normal, you can include some changes in the lifestyle to protect your health and prevent the blood pressure of going up from the start. You can also use it to improve your overall health. You just need to track your blood pressure often to look for any in consistencies. Source : healthandhealthyliving.com",

Am J Med. 2016 Jan 30; Authors: Verbrugge FH, Grodin JL, Mullens W, Taylor DO, Starling RC, Tang WH Abstract OBJECTIVE: To study whether the temporal pattern of transient hyponatremia development in acute heart failure might provide insight into its pathophysiology and prognostic relevance. METHODS: A post-hoc analysis of the ESCAPE and DOSE AHF studies was performed (n=716). Patients were stratified according to the temporal pattern of hyponatremia development: (1) no hyponatremia; (2) persistent hyponatremia; (3) decompensation hyponatremia disappearing with decongestive treatment; and (4) treatment-induced hyponatremia. RESULTS: Transient decompensation versus no hyponatremia was associated with significantly elevated blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio (P-value<0.001), plasma renin activity (P-value<0.001), and plasma aldosterone levels (P-value<0.001) at baseline. Disease severity characteristics of such patients were intermediate between no and persistent hyponatremia. In contrast, patients with treatment-induced versus no hyponatremia had similar baseline characteristics, comparable natriuretic peptide levels, and both groups had little neurohumoral activation at baseline. Diuretic efficacy, defined as net fluid balance [mL] per 40 mg furosemide-equivalent dose administered, was lower in patients with persistent or treatment-induced hyponatremia versus decompensation hyponatremia or no hyponatremia, respectively. The former versus latter groups also had more pronounced neurohumoral activation with decongestive treatment. The risk for all-cause mortality [HR (95%CI) = 2.50 (1.50-4.19); P-value<0.001] and death or heart failure readmission [HR (95%CI) = 2.18 (1.60-2.97); P-value<0.001] was significantly elevated in patients with persistent versus no hyponatremia, with the risk of decompensation and treatment-hyponatremia situated in-between. CONCLUSIONS: Transient hyponatremia is prognostically relevant, but has a heterogeneous etiology according to its temporal pattern of development. PMID: 26836387 [PubMed ? as supplied by publisher]",

When this occurs, the heart is unable to provide adequate blood flow to other organs such as the brain, liver and kidneys. Heart failure may be due to failure of the right or left or both ventricles. The signs and symptoms depend upon which side of the heart is failing. They can include shortness of breath (dyspnea), asthma due to the heart (cardiac asthma), pooling of blood (stasis) in the general body (systemic) circulation or in the liver's (portal) circulation, swelling (edema), blueness or duskiness (cyanosis), and enlargement (hypertrophy) of the heart. There are many causes of congestive heart failure including: (1) coronary artery disease leading to heart attacks and heart muscle weakness, (2) primary heart muscle weakness from viral infections or toxins such as prolonged alcohol exposure, (3) heart valve disease causing heart muscle weakness due to too much leaking of blood or heart muscle stiffness from a blocked valve, and (4) hypertension (high blood pressure). Rarer causes include hyperthyroidism (high thyroid hormone), vitamin deficiency, and excess amphetamine (""speed"") use. The aim of therapy is to improve the pumping function of the heart. General treatment includes salt restriction, diuretics (to get rid of excess fluid), digoxin (to strengthen the heart), and other medications. A drug called spironolactone has been found to be a major help in treating congestive heart failure Its beneficial effects are additive to those from ACE inhibitors, another class of drugs commonly relied on in treating heart failure. A pacemaker-like device is also now available to treat heart failure. The implantable device delivers synchronized electrical stimulation to three chambers of the heart, enabling the heart to pump blood more efficiently throughout the body.

Because its effectiveness varies, should the price also? Dr. P. Marazzi / Science Source Medicare is going to test new ways to reimburse doctors for medications, in hopes they'll choose less expensive drugs. The plan would alter Medicare Part B, which pays for medicines administered in doctors offices or outpatient hospital clinics ? to eliminate incentives for doctors to use the most expensive drugs. The changes would have an outsize effect on cancer doctors and clinics. Medicare Part B shelled out about $7.8 billion on cancer drugs in 2014, or 42 percent of its total spending on drugs that year. The program now reimburses the doctors or clinics for the cost of the medication plus a 6 percent fee. That means doctors and hospitals earn more money when they use pricier drugs. As it is now, Dr. Patrick Conway , chief medical officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, called the reimbursement structure ""perverse."" ""We've heard from oncologists who feel pressure from their health system to pick higher cost drugs even when they are not appropriate for a patient,"" he said in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday. The agency plans to test a reimbursement formula that would pay the cost of the drug, plus a 2.5 percent surcharge and a flat fee of $16.80. Under the current system, a doctor earns just 60 cents for administering a $10 medication. An equivalent drug that cots $1,000, however, would bring in $60. Under the proposed formula, the cheaper drug in this example would generate a payment of $16.93 and the second one $41.80, according to CMS. CMS officials say that change would mostly eliminate the incentive to choose a high priced drug over one that may be more appropriate. Medicare Part B spent about $20 billion on outpatient medicines last year. ""We're trying to align the incentives to what's best for patients and doctors,"" Conway said. The Medicare Part B plan would also reduce or eliminate the share of the drugs' costs that patients have to pay. Dr. Peter Bach, director of The Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, says research shows doctors prescribe higher priced drugs when they bring in more profit. ""It is refreshing to see Medicare move towards an experiment where they pay for drugs using a flat fee reimbursement, where what doctors and hospitals make is related to giving the drug, not how much it costs,"" Bach said in a statement to Shots. But other cancer doctors aren't so thrilled. The American Society of Clinical Oncology opposes the CMS proposal. The proposal could have a major effect on oncologists because many cancer patients receive their chemotherapy treatments in doctors offices or clinics. ""It is inappropriate for CMS to manipulate choice of treatment for cancer patients using heavy-handed reimbursement techniques,"" said ASCO CEO Allen Lichter in a statement posted on the physician group's website. ASCO, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association and about 100 other physician and advocacy groups sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell last week opposing the payment changes. ""We believe that this type of initiative, implemented without sufficient stakeholder input, will adversely affect the care and treatment of Medicare patients with complex conditions,"" the letter said. The agency plans to field test the new reimbursement formula, as well as a handful of others ideas, in different regions of the country starting later this year. CMS will then compare the results to determine which changes are effective at reducing drug spending. CMS is also planning to test a handful of so-called value-based pricing ideas. The first would pay for drugs according to how well they work. For example, if a cancer medication is very effective in eliminating a specific tumor, but is also used on a second, different condition with less success, Medicare will pay less when it is used for the second condition than the first. Sloan Kettering's Bach, who served as an adviser to CMS on cancer policy in 2005 and 2006, argued for varying payments for drugs this way in a 2014 paper published in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association. The approach is called indication-based pricing. The agency also plans to work with drugmakers to link prices to patient outcomes, perhaps paying less for medications when patients end up being admitted to a hospital. Private insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have been testing similar ideas. Cigna last month said it had agreed with drugmaker Novartis on a pay-for-performance deal for the heart failure drug Entresto. Under the agreement, Cigna will pay less if patients taking the medication are hospitalized for heart failure. And Express Scripts, the biggest manager of pharmacy benefits, says it's working with cancer drug manufacturers to pay indication-based prices that tie cost to how well the drugs perform. The CMS proposal is open for public comment until May 9. Conway said the field tests will begin after the comment period is complete. Copyright 2016 NPR.

In a nursing community, when a new patient arrives the care plan is started immediately. At first it might only be a rough outline of the challenges the patient faces. Maybe the patient has had recent surgery and has a wound that needs to be tended to. Or the patient might have been admitted due to a recent fall or injury. The staff needs to immediately know about safety precautions and the amount of assistance the patient needs on admission. Within hours of admission that preliminary care plan is replaced with a complete plan created by all facility departments. These individual care plans are developed after extensive assessments. Now the patient who has fallen has had; a complete plan written by physical therapy, occupational therapy and if needed speech therapy, as well as: nursing care plans for safety, how much assistance the patient needs to walk, stand up from a chair, even turn in bed, if the patient has safety risks due to dementia what does the confused person need to be safe, nursing care plans for every medication the patient is on from diuretics to psychiatric medications, nursing care plans for the nursing assistants for basic care ? if the patient wears upper and lower dentures, does the patient go to the bathroom independently or does he wear incontinent products, how much assistance does the patient need to dress, bathe etc. nursing care plans for every disease process the patient has such as diabetes, congestive heart failure, arthritis etc. social service care plans are where you would find out if the patient is a smoker or not, information about the family, especially if there is a problematic relationship, information about mood especially if the patient suffers from depression, information about the language the patient best communicates in and social services will track information from all departments to determine a discharge date activity care plans will tell staff what specific interests the patient has, if he is religious to make sure he doesn?t miss any religious services, does he like animals, gardening, art, music, live entertainment, all of those activities available in a nursing community dietary care plans these plans range from what the patient likes to dislikes, dietary restrictions and dietary needs as well as how independent the patient is in eating or drinking At first the care plan reflects the immediate problems, then after complete assessment it includes all the information necessary to take care of a person. Then the staff begin the real work of getting to know the patient, many times through family interview. Knowing the patient was a night worker and might still in old age like to be up at night, or that the patient was in the military and likes things as well as himself very neat. This very personal information turns nursing care plans into person-centered care plans, by far the best kind of plan of care.

Positive data regarding the device?s safety and clinical performance from the BIOSOLVE-II trial was previously published in The Lancet ; one-year data confirming long-term safety was recently published in The European Heart Journal . ?Now that clinical results have firmly established the safety and clinical performance of Magmaris, the magnesium-based scaffold could emerge as a strong alternative to currently available polymer-based scaffolds,? commented BIOSOLVE-II principal investigator Dr. Michael Haude of the In addition to these properties, Magmaris offers a faster resorption compared to polymer-based scaffolds. ?The body?s ability to quickly resorb magnesium leads to a faster and therefore more desirable resorption time,? stated Dr. Stephan Kische , Vivantes Cardiology Clinic, Berlin, Germany. ?As the results of BIOSOLVE-II demonstrate, vessels can restore vasomotion as soon as six months after the procedure.?2 ?CE mark approval for Magmaris opens a new horizon in the vascular therapeutic field,? said Dr. Daniel Buehler, President, Vascular Intervention at BIOTRONIK. ?We are eager to bring our magnesium scaffold to market, as we strongly believe that only a resorbable metal alloy can provide patients the distinctive advantages capable of addressing their future needs.? About Magmaris Magmaris is a limus-eluting bioresorbable magnesium scaffold exclusively available from BIOTRONIK. Due to the scaffold?s magnesium backbone, it offers novel benefits that only a metallic scaffold can offer such as desired deliverability, strong radial support and a fast resorption time of approximately 12 months. In addition, the proven BIOlute coating, consisting of a limus drug and an excipient, ensures controlled drug release to inhibit cell growth similarly to Orsiro, BIOTRONIK?s hybrid drug-eluting stent.

Scientists at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center have found that a daily dose of beetroot juice significantly improved exercise endurance and blood pressure in elderly patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). The study is published in the current online edition of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology-Heart Failure. Exercise intolerance -- shortness of breath and fatigue with normal amounts of exertion -- is the primary symptom of HFPEF and is due partly to non-cardiac factors that reduce oxygen delivery to active skeletal muscles. HFPEF is a recently recognized disease that reflects how the left ventricle of the heart pumps with each beat. It occurs primarily in older women and is the dominant form of heart failure, as well as the most rapidly increasing cardiovascular disorder in this country. Emerging evidence suggests that dietary inorganic nitrate supplementation has beneficial effects on blood pressure control, vascular health, exercise capacity and oxygen metabolism. The Wake Forest Baptist researchers enrolled 19 people in a double-blinded, randomized safety study to determine which was better at improving exercise intolerance, a single dose or a daily dose of the juice given over multiple days. The beetroot juice used is produced by a company in the United Kingdom and is not commercially available in this country. First, aerobic endurance and blood pressure were measured after the participants received either a single dose of beetroot juice or a placebo. The researchers then administered a daily dose of beetroot juice to all 19 patients for an average of seven days, and measured endurance and blood pressure again. The juice dose in the study was equivalent to 2.4 ounces containing approximately 6 millimoles of inorganic nitrate. The team found that the daily dosing of beetroot juice improved aerobic endurance by 24 percent after one week, as compared to the single dose which produced no improvement. Aerobic endurance was measured as cycling time to exhaustion at a fixed workload lower than their maximum. Another finding was that consumption of the juice significantly reduced resting systolic blood pressure in both the single and daily dose groups by 5 to 10 mmHg. No adverse events were associated with either intervention. ""Although larger trials need to be conducted, these initial findings suggest that one week of daily beetroot juice could be a potential therapeutic option to improve aerobic endurance in patients with HFPEF, which has implications for improving everyday activities and quality of life,"" said Dalane Kitzman, M.D., professor of internal medicine at Wake Forest Baptist and senior author of the study.

Apply it on the boil 2times a day for one week.one will experience a soothing relief from the pain caused by the boil and also a drastic reduction and final healing. (2)SKIN INFECTION: The anti-bacterial power of garlic is also effective when applied externally. Crush cloves of garlic and apply it at the topmost part of the affected area and leave it over night(a bandage is also needed to hold it in place).Alternatively one can also mix the crushed garlic cloves with coconut oil(Coconut oil also possesses anti-bacteria and anti-fungal properties)and rub it as a cream on the affected part daily. One was experience a rapid healing effect on the infected part of the skin. (3)WARTS: Slice cloves of garlic and put it on the wart .Use bandage to hold it in place .keep doing this regularly mornings and evenings until the wart is gone. (4) HEART ATTACKS: Garlic acts as an effective preventive against heart attack. This is because it thins the blood by reducing platelet aggregation. Boil garlic cloves with milk together and take one tea spoon at night to prevent heart problem. Alternatively Chew 4-5 cloves of garlic occasionally to prevent heart failure. (5)AMOEBIC DYSENTRY: Taking garlic several times a day (either in raw or capsular form) clears and cleans the system from the bacteria or parasites that causes amoebic dysentery. (6) COLDS/FLU: Take cloves of garlic daily(either in raw or capsular form).For infants, it can be taken with honey. It can also be applied to the bottom of the feet of infants as a poultice(remember to use a layer of oil and cream first before applying the garlic as a poultice).The cloves of garlic can be eaten regularly with cough syrup and vitamin C. This is because garlic has no side effect on the body also this will help to boost the body immunity which was drastically brought low by the virus (adequate rest is also needed). (7)TOOTHACHE: Garlic gives an immense relief from toothache. This is because it has antibiotic and other medicinal properties that is very effective in slowing down the effects of bacteria on the tooth. Crush a garlic clove and mix it table salt (salt is a powerful germicide).Apply it directly on the affected tooth. Alternatively, one can chew one or two of garlic.

Additionally, around 1 in 4 deaths in the US is attributed to some form of heart disease. Depression and heart disease are not only incredibly common, they also appear to be intrinsically linked. After a heart attack or heart failure, some individuals who have never been troubled by depression can find themselves under its spell. Conversely, people who have suffered from depression seem more likely to develop heart problems later in life. A new study, carried out at the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Salt Lake City, UT, investigates this relationship further. Depression and cardiac risk Researcher Heidi May, PhD, a cardiovascular epidemiologist, wanted to examine whether treating depression reduces the chances of developing heart disease. An additional question that May set out to answer was whether brief encounters with depression still have the ability to increase the risk of heart problems further down the line. To investigate these questions, May delved into data from Intermountain Healthcare?s depression registry, containing information from more than 100,000 patients. This information source proved essential for the success of the research, as May explains: ?There?s little publicly available data about this question.? From the database, the team used data from the 7,550 patients who had filled in at least two depression questionnaires over the course of 2 years. The individuals were then divided into four groups: never depressed, no longer depressed, remained depressed and became depressed. The patients were followed to observe whether they later developed cardiovascular problems including stroke, heart attack or heart failure. Treating depression reduces cardiac risk The results showed that individuals who were no longer depressed had similar rates of heart disease as those who had never been depressed (4.6% and 4.8%, respectively). However, in the group of individuals who had become depressed during the study or remained depressed, the rates of cardiac disease were higher (6% and 6.4%, respectively). In other words, treatment for depression resulted in a decreased level of cardiovascular risk that was roughly equivalent to someone who did not have depression. May summarizes the results as follows: ?Our study shows that prompt, effective treatment of depression appears to improve the risk of poor heart health.? Past research has shown that depression increases the chances of cardiovascular health issues in the long-term but, as May explains, ?knowing that alleviating the symptoms of depression reduces a person?s risk of heart disease in the short term, too, can help care providers and patients commit more fully to treating the symptoms of depression.? The findings will be presented at the 2016 American College of Cardiology Scientific Sessions in Chicago, IL, on April 2nd. May hopes to continue research in this field. She notes that the results of the current study are observational, and full clinical trials will be necessary to investigate the interplay between depression and heart disease further. A complex web of factors There is a swarm of potentially confounding variables that must be studied and controlled before solid conclusions can be drawn. For instance, individuals with depression are more likely to be obese; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 43% of depressed adults are obese. Of course, obesity comes with its own range of related cardiac issues. Lack of exercise is another factor that can increase the risk of heart disease and obesity, and also increase the chances of depression. The web between these factors will be no mean feat to unfurl. Once these factors have been controlled for, and the results are in, the best methods of treating depression will still need to be discussed. Certain antidepressant medications can, themselves, cause changes in weight. The story certainly is a complex one. AUTHROR: Tim Newman On medicalnewstoday.com",

This post created quite a lot of discussion and debate. While I agree with the author and commenters that observation is confusing to all and that there has to be a better way, the premise that observation is costlier is absolutely false. Allow me to present the facts about observation. As of October 1, 2013, the two-midnight rule became the law of the land for fee-for-service Medicare patients. That means that any patient who requires hospital care past a second midnight must be admitted as an inpatient. Patients who do not require hospital care can remain as outpatients past the second midnight, such as patients who are kept because they do not have a ride home, or there is no one home to care for them, but their care is being provided to them as a courtesy with no expectation of payment by Medicare. These patients, by the way, should be informed they are being kept as a courtesy, so they do not think they are accruing days for nursing home eligibility. What are the costs of inpatient admission compared to observation? If the patient is admitted as inpatient, they owe a $1,288 deductible, no matter the length of stay. That deductible is only waived if they had been an inpatient within the last 60 days. For the commonly readmitted diagnoses, such as pneumonia and heart failure, there is a 20 percent chance they were recently an inpatient, but it is much lower for most other diagnoses.

Now a study done at Aristotle University in Thessaloniki, Greece has shown Greek dancing improves the jumping ability of elderly patients with heart failure. The research was published April 15th in the European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing. Patients randomized to Greek dancing jumped higher and faster than their sedentary counterparts. Those who danced had stronger legs and could walk further. A release from the publisher quotes Zacharias Vordos, an exercise physiologist at Aristotle University, as saying, ?Greek dancing is an important part of weddings and other celebrations, and is popular among older people. We believed dancing would increase the attractiveness of rehabilitation programs for patients with chronic heart failure. This was the first study to assess the impact of traditional Greek dancing on jumping ability.? The release notes that the study included 40 Greek patients with chronic heart failure who were randomly assigned to a three month rehabilitation program based on traditional Greek dancing or to their usual sedentary lifestyle. Exercise training took place at three municipal gyms and consisted of three 40 to 65 minute weekly sessions. Patients were 73 years old on average and none had done any exercise in the past year. At the beginning and end of the study, the researchers tested patients? jumping ability using a Myotest-Pro dynamometer. Jumping ability included jump height, amount of time the feet were in contact with the ground, and strength and speed during the jumps. In case patients were hard of hearing, both an audible alarm and visible signal from the researcher were used to tell patients when to start each jump. Strength of the leg muscles was assessed with a leg-chest dynamometer. Endurance of the leg muscles was evaluated using the six-minute walking test. There were no differences between groups in any of the measurements at the start of the study. After three months, patients who participated in Greek dancing jumped higher and faster than the sedentary patients. They also had stronger legs and could walk further, demonstrating more endurance. When the researchers compared the performance of the dancing group at the start and end of the study, they found that their endurance and leg strength had improved by 10%, and they jumped 10% higher and around 6% faster. The sedentary group showed no change between the initial and final measurements. ?Our study shows that traditional Greek dancing improves strength, endurance and jumping ability in elderly patients with heart failure,? said Mr. Vordos. ?Patients who participated in Greek dancing jumped higher at the end of the training program, probably because they had stronger leg muscles.?",

As noted, the heart attack protocol includes morphine, while digoxin may induce arrhythmias and ultimately heart attack. This is how it's used in feticide. The classic heart attack is extremely painful. That's why morphine is part of the emergency protocol for MI, and it's why inducing fetal heart attack may cause pain, not prevent it. ""Pain"" is inherently subjective; hence the phrase, ""may feel [or cause] pain."" Nociception at 20 weeks' gestation is uncontroversial, however, even for Stuart Derbyshire, who doesn't think kids can feel emotional pain until at least 12 months after birth. Conversely, KJS Anand thinks fetuses between 20 and 30 weeks GA (gestational age) feel pain more intensely than you and I do, as their pain inhibition capability is undeveloped. The word ""may"" is judicious. The mother considering abortion may feel intense emotional pain of her own: desperation, confusion, anguish, fear. She may think abortion is her only way out. But even if abortion benefits a woman, that benefit comes at the expense of her dead child and an erosion of all human rights. Either way, caring for the mother need not, and does not, entail killing her unborn child. It entails compassion, not judgment; facts, not propaganda; problem-solving, not problem-eliminating.",

(NASDAQ:CLBS) (?Caladrius? or the ?Company?), a leading cell therapy company combining an industry-leading development and manufacturing services provider with a select therapeutic product pipeline, announces that the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency?s (PMDA) thirty-day review period of the Company?s Clinical Trial Notification (CTN) for a pivotal Phase 2 trial investigating the Company?s CLBS12 product candidate, a CD34 cell therapy for critical limb ischemia (CLI), has now passed without further comment from the PMDA. Accordingly, Caladrius is allowed to proceed with the trial when ready. The Company is seeking a partnership in order to pursue this trial, and is currently in advanced discussions with potential licensing partners. Pending consummation of a partnering agreement, Caladrius expects that the pivotal trial could initiate as early as late 2016. The Company believes the study design is sufficient to achieve conditional approval for CLBS12 in Japan for the treatment of CLI. The agreed trial is a 35-patient Phase 2, prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter study in patients with no-option CLI conducted in Japan. Those patients randomized to treatment will be dosed with autologous G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood-derived CD34+ cells (CLBS12) through intramuscular injection in addition to standard of care. Patients randomized to the control arm will receive standard of care pharmacotherapy alone. ?We are pleased that our interactions with the PMDA have led to the design of a relatively small and, we believe, low risk trial that could significantly advance CLBS12 and the Company?s CD34 asset,? said David J. Mazzo, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Caladrius. ?We look forward to achieving a partnership to enable the launch of this pivotal Phase 2 trial in Japan. CLI is just the entry-point to explore the broader applicability of the CD34 platform therapy, which could potentially be effective in the treatment of chronic heart failure or dilated cardiomyopathy.? Caladrius has decided to aggressively pursue this registration pathway in Japan largely due to the recent Regenerative Medicine Law passed in November 2014. The legislation expedites the development and commercialization of regenerative medicine therapies and grants conditional approval for regenerative medicines that demonstrate safety and the likelihood for efficacy. ?Based on the substantial clinical data from four prior trials in critical limb ischemia and claudication, we believe that CD34 cell therapy is not only safe, but can help improve quality of life and potentially treat patients with this serious and life-threatening condition, which we intend to demonstrate through this pivotal study,? said Dr. Atsuhiko Kawamoto, principal investigator for this pivotal Phase 2 trial for CLBS12. Dr. Kawamoto is the Director of the Unit of Regenerative Medicine and Leader of the Vascular Regeneration Research Group at the Institute of Biomedical Research and Innovation in Kobe, Japan. He is also the Vice Director of the Translational Research Informatics Center at the Foundation for Biomedical Research and Innovation. About CLBS12 CD34 cells have been investigated in clinical studies encompassing over 700 patients with over 400 receiving CD34 cell therapy exposure. The scientific rationale for CLBS12 is based on previous studies of autologous CD34 cell therapy for no-option CLI patients in both Japan and the U.S. From those previous studies, researchers found that CD34 cell injection was safe, led to improvement in CLI-free status and improved amputation-free survival and other clinical parameters. About Critical Limb Ischemia Critical limb ischemia is a severe obstruction of the arteries which markedly reduces blood flow to the extremities (hands, feet and legs). CLI is an advanced stage of peripheral artery disease, which results from a progressive thickening of an artery?s lining (caused by a build-up of plaque). It can lead to pain, skin ulcers and sores, and if not successfully addressed, eventually amputation. One year after CLI onset, only 50% of patients will remain amputation-free (though may still be symptomatic), 25% will require a major amputation and the remaining 25% will have died. Caladrius? CD34 cell approach, if successful, could aid patients who currently have no other therapeutic options for this devastating disease.""",

It is not uncommon for the largest corporations such as Apple and Google to have multiple claims challenged on the way to ultimate approval by USPTO and International review bodies. The process involves give and take between IP counsel and examiners. EPGL has several non-provisional and PCT applications pending at present. This includes those jointly filed with CooperVision As an example, some existing patents may include similarities in art, but not all claims are exactly alike. It is the IP lawyers who work with the USPTO and PCT to illuminate the important differences. Quote: @EPGLMed $EPGL Energy Harvester in a contact lens gets Novelty and Inventive step on on specific device (claim 5) design. Great start. Just the beginning. We have novelty on EVERY claim on another key patent pending (yet to be made public) - another great start. More coming. RECENT TWITTER UPDATES ~~~EPIC~~~~~ Quote: EPGLMed: To potential EPGL Investors who have not taken a position yet, Here's the bet you are making by investing in EPGL: In 2013 and and 2014, tiny EPGL and Large CooperVision, Inc. teamed up in a Development Agreement. As EPGL team began to prove to in CooperVision R&D head, Dr. Arthur Back, that our innovations actually worked in real, modern, mass produceable, Silicone Hydrogel lenses, CooperVision then signed EPGL to a Second Development Agreement that was bigger and more comprehensive of all EPGL technologies. Joint IP, as a result of the proven concepts, then began to be filed. Those jointly developed patents originated from experimentation in real-world CooperVision, Inc. manufacturing facilities. We have strong reason to believe that neither Google nor Alcon/Novartis was ahead of EPGL/CooperVision. Nothing is promised, but that is what our best knowledge is. The potential market for Autofocus enabled contact lenses alone is $5B + annual. The market for other combined vision enhancements and potential AR applications is estimated by top CEO's in technology to be worth $100B. So, as a potential investor, you are making the bet that tiny EPGL who (through settlement negotiations ) has now gained 100% ownership and control, while allowing CooperVision to be the FIRST to have license, has pending patents that in some cases could ""run the table"" of this massive potential market if granted. That is the bet YOU are making if you go long-EPGL, if this tiny OTC is on to something very big as we believe we are. And don't let others try to tell you this situation is too good to be true, because what has just been laid -out for you is the facts, backed by independent documents So, you decide, after doing due diligence and reading all materials. EPGL is only at 3 cents currently due to low volume moves. The volatility works both ways however. EPGL has a chart history of big gains over time and rising back to pass previous highs. In summary, with our NEW Ownership of the pending patents and WORLDWIDE rights, EPGL is better positioned than ever for growth from IP licensing and partnerships if ONLY ONE of the jointly developed patents we have filed and is pending presently, gets approval, those who use it will have to pay EPGL royalties, whether or not we have a formal license Agreement with them. The bet? The bet is on IP that may pay-off big if granted and if the coming Vision Revolution is as big as predicted. Literally all things now on your smartphone, are being predicted to be and if the coming Vision Revolution is as big as predicted made available in your field of vision. Think that is big? Good luck with whatever bet you make on EPGL! Michael Hayes & Dr. Markus at Intel HQ for meeting in 2014 . Michael Hayes, Dr. David Markus & Dr. Arthur Back at CooperVision, Inc. ""Inventing the future of vision."" Michael Hayes and Gavin Rossdale about to watch Federer and Djokavic play in CA. Michael Hayes and Dr. David Markus in San Francisco. EPGL and CooperVision, Inc. are not ""done"" at all. The parties must continue to adhere to their latest Agreement which governs rights and ownership of the jointly developed technologies. This arrangement will go on for years. EPGL intends for CooperVision to be only one of many companies to have license to our newfound ownership and control of the technology. In fact, EPGL is now in process of implementing new plans that will begin to become visible within the next 14 days. Our last PR was misunderstood by many. EPGLs position and potential is now stronger than ever before with what we have gained. 2016 is truly the new beginning. NEW PATENTS PENDING. NEW OWNERSHIP & CONTROL. NEW WORLDWIDE MARKETING RIGHTS. 3 reasons why EPGL is a player in the coming VISION REVOLUTION! https://twitter.com/EPGLMed EVIDENCE OF JOINT PATENT FILING WITH MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR NYSE LEADER. Kilyck & Bowersox, P.L.L.C. (IP and Patent specialists) http://kbpatentlaw.com/Pages/OurFirm.html Quote: All previous medical device technologies such as ""Topspin"", ""Smart Epidural"" ""Smart Ablation"", etc. etc, we're under CooperVision, Inc. exclusivity under the pre-settlement Agreement. Now, EPGL has regained 100% control of those technologies too and plans to continue the patent prosecution for those technologies. This development adds even more potential IP back into EPGL hands as a result of the Settlement. Company Summary EP Global Communications, Inc., is a research and development company with focus on medical device design, ophthalmic medical device design, consumer electronic device design and device technologies in the IoT space. In 2014, all EPGL technologies and Intellectual property were selected and put under Development Agreement by CooperVision, Inc., a leading medical device manufacturer, for development and marketing. The EPGL team is now securing Intellectual Properties and co-developing a family of advanced devices as a result. This Development Agreement was publicly disclosed on August 29, 2014. In addition, EPGL has entered an initial Agreement with Intel Corporation. EPGL has also entered into Agreements with AT&T as of January 2015. EPGL and AT&T have created joint Intellectual Properties and are now in the process of procuring those properties. EPGL Medical is the result of a reorganization which culminated in July 2012. With a strong team of medical and scientific professionals, the Company is poised to capture market share with innovative ?smart medical and consumer electronic devices? technologies including those that require advanced microelectronic mechanical systems (MEMS). The Company philosophy is that healthcare is going to become an increasingly challenging environment for both physicians and patients. A coming boom in patients simultatneous to a possible shortage of physicians will necessitate intuitive medical devices which can be used by a broader variety of doctors. In short, new ?smart medical devices? advanced research and design intellectual properties will be needed more than ever. EPGL Medical has the know-how to develop technologies which fit this coming new healthcare environment and enable industry leaders to capture market share with those advanced technologies.

As healthcare clinicians, we routinely demonstrate our competency in providing Basic and Advanced Cardiac Life Support, yet many of us lack confidence in providing palliative care for our heart failure patients. Yet research has shown that palliative approaches to care can have many benefits for patients with heart problems. Those who specialize in palliative care or hospice may feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the medications, devices and pathophysiology. At the same time, clinicians who routinely care for cardiac patients? most complex needs may feel ill-equipped when drugs, devices and procedures are not able to fix their problems. Over the last 12 years, I have tried to bridge these two specialties, the cardiology and palliative care specialties. Tags:  Published: Tue Jun 21 16:46:41 EDT 2016",

It may therefore be to us from the interest dividend? On Sunday, June 5 was held in Switzerland a referendum on the introduction of the so-called. guaranteed income, also known as the primary income. This concept works for some time, mainly among left-wing economists (even if it promotes Guy Standing, the creator of the concept of precarity) and is untaxed amount of money obtained unconditionally by every citizen - regardless of their material status, or employment. In the case of Switzerland proposed the sum of 2,500 francs per adult and 625 francs for minors. Finally, the referendum ended in failure initiators - the ratio of 76.9 percent. voting ""against"" to 23.1 percent. ""behind"". Proponents of this solution argue that the state still seems large sums on social assistance in different forms, so you might as well to accumulate it - instead of a variety of benefits citizens would receive a monthly uniform, steady cash injection. Furthermore robotics jobs, growing ""u?mieciowienie"" employment, increasing income stratification and systematic decrease in the share of wages in GDP makes life more and wider social strata crept element of instability, uncertainty of tomorrow. For this, precarization also creates a threat to the livelihoods of future retirees, exposed to starvation benefits after retirement from the labor market. The latter issue has recently been regaled also noted in Poland, hence the emphasis on reducing ""flexible forms of employment."" Opponents point to the costs of introducing basic income (Swiss government talked about spending the order of 208 billion Swiss francs a year - even after the elimination of existing social benefits you would need to find an additional 25 billion), demotivating the program (money obtained ""for nothing"" discourage active job search) in Polish realities revives additionally memory of socialism and the principle of ""if you stand, whether you lies."" And I? In fact, I regret that this experiment in Switzerland did not work out because of curiosity obserwowa?bym its effects. So far, a similar ""civic pension"" was introduced in Alaska - from the special fund the inhabitants of this state receive 2 thousand. USD per year. The pilot program also functions in Utrecht, while in Germany were collected as part of crowdfunding measures to take the initiative ""My Basic Income"" dozens of people. Fitting therefore continue, but in the case of Switzerland, for the first time would have to deal with the complex implementation solutions for the entire country and at the level of the minimum social security. In fact, as a person whose thinking about the economy over the years has been shaped reading korwinowskiego ""High Time"" should turn away in disgust from such ideas ""recidivism socialism,"" but the concept of a guaranteed income somehow attracts me. It has one undeniable advantage: simplicity. Let's leave aside the wealthy Swiss and take a look around at your own backyard. Currently in Poland we have very confused distributed services implemented by various state agencies and local government. And if so, realistically, there is no coherent system of social welfare. Eligible to help citizens get (awarded by inconsistent, uneven criteria) unemployment benefits, pensions, nursing allowances, benefits, parental subsidies for rents, media, school supplies, baby bonus, nutrition programs, to the state-owned enterprises reach various benefits industry recently started a program ""500 +"" which is essentially just a form of guaranteed income - so that the fragmentary, because awarded for second and subsequent children. In short, this is a plethora, and I bet that no one on it does not really control. Because individual benefits deal with the different structures in the state administration and local government, this results in high maintenance costs, - for each type of benefit are osobn? officials, who must accept the request, examine, in the meantime, have a coffee and talk with Mrs. Halina from the desk next to, decide whether and admit what extent the provision ... Tedious is, labor-intensive and cost-intensive - and above all, ineffective, even though - in total - considerable resources. Some have learned to prey on the system, while others avoid seeking assistance because it stigmatizes. And now, the question arises: if someone ventured to a summary of expenditure for the whole area of ??Polish 'socjalu ""(including operating costs), does not turn out that well, you can enter basic income? Not to mention the creation of uplift pressure on wages, we finally ceased to be Bangladesh Europe. In the end, if we look at the state as a joint stock company, everyone - regardless of social status - we are equivalent shareholders, because each of us has the same electoral card. It may therefore be to us from the interest dividend?

SKLAR ON MARCH 8, 2016 IN GOVERNMENT Nancy Reagan and Ronald Reagan aboard a boat, 1964. Photo via Wikipedia A trio of former First Ladies, including Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, and current First Lady Michelle Obama will be among those attending Friday?s funeral service for Nancy Reagan at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum. Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill wrote on his Twitter account that the former First Lady ?is going to drop off the (campaign) trail briefly on Friday to attend Nancy Reagan?s funeral services in California.? Former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, are also expected to attend, along with former first lady Rosalynn Carter, according to officials at the Reagan Library. Former President Lyndon Johnson?s daughters Luci and Lynda are expected to attend, along with Tricia Nixon Cox, a daughter of President Richard Nixon. The White House announced Monday that Michelle Obama will be in attendance. President Barack Obama is not expected to accompany his wife. ?Mrs. Reagan was a woman of incredible strength and grace and she was a passionate advocate for so many important issues,? Michelle Obama said today. ?For the example she set both during her time in the White House and beyond, Mrs. Reagan reminded us of the importance of women?s leadership at every level of society. ?And on a personal note, Mrs. Reagan also understood the value of mentoring,? she said. ?She warmly and willingly offered advice and encouragement to me as I settled in to my role as first lady, and I am so grateful for her kindness and generosity to me and my family over the years.? Nancy Reagan, who died in her sleep Sunday at her Bel Air home at the age of 94, will be buried Friday next to her husband, the 40th president, with whom she had a love affair spanning five decades. U.S. flags on public buildings across the country ? and at the Reagan Library ? were lowered to half-staff in her memory Monday, following a directive from President Barack Obama. ?I think it?s been well-documented the extraordinary love that she had for her husband, and the extraordinary comfort and strength she provided him during really hard times,? Obama said in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. ?As somebody who is lucky enough to have an extraordinary partner in my life as well, I know how much she meant not just to President Reagan but to the country as a whole. ?He was lucky to have her,? Obama said. ?? She will be missed.? The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation announced that funeral services will be held at 11 a.m. Friday at the library. The service will be closed to the public. Nancy Reagan will lie in repose at the Reagan library from 1 to 7 p.m. Wednesday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Thursday, giving people a chance to pay their respects. No parking will be allowed at the library. People who want to pay their respects will need to park at the former Bank of America property at 400 National Way, Simi Valley, and take a shuttle. Foundation officials noted that security will be tight, so people should not bring large bags, cameras or strollers. Gifts and flowers will only be accepted at the bottom of Presidential Drive and at the shuttle pickup location. According to the foundation, Nancy Reagan requested that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to the Ronald Reagan Memorial Fund at www.reaganlibrary.com. The Reagan library will remain closed to the public until 10 a.m. Sunday. A fierce protector of her husband?s presidential legacy, the woman behind the ?Just Say No? anti-drug campaign and the first lady known for tasteful glamour at the White House, Nancy Reagan died of congestive heart failure while asleep at the Bel Air home where she had lived since 1989, Ronald Reagan Foundation spokeswoman Joanne Drake said. Reagan?s daughter, Patti Davis, said in a statement on her website that her mother ?had been in poor health for quite a while, and recently had gotten markedly worse, so this wasn?t a surprise.? ?That said, death always feels like a surprise,? she said. ?I appreciate the attention and prayers of people I will probably never meet. Just as when my father died, there is comfort in feeling surrounded by gentle thoughts and kind wishes, often sent out by strangers. And just as when my father died, we will honor my mother publicly ? stand on the public stage and share as much as we can. Then, when that is completed, we?ll draw the circle in a little tighter and deal with the often complicated map of personal loss.? Born Anne Frances Robbins in a troubled home in New York City, the future first lady was adopted and gained a new last name from her stepfather, Dr. Loyal Davis, a Chicago physician. Anne Davis went by the nickname Nancy as she grew up and graduated from Smith College in 1943, did some acting on the Broadway stage and broke into the movies when MGM?s George Cukor gave her a bit part in 1949?s ?East Side, West Side.? The studio changed her first name to Nancy. After the name Nancy Davis was printed in a newspaper letter supporting blacklisted scriptwriters, she sought the help of the Screen Actors Guild to make it clear that she was not that Nancy Davis, and the listing had been a mistake. Ronald Reagan was the president of the guild, who helped her make sure the studios and public made that distinction. They married in March 1952, and together purchased a home at 1251 Amalfi Drive, in Pacific Palisades, where they lived until a move to Sacramento in 1966. They had two children together, Patti and Ron Jr., and she also helped raise Ronald Reagan?s two children with his first wife, Jane Wyman. ?Hellcats Of the Navy? in 1957 was the only movie they appeared together in, but she continued to act in TV and minor movie roles. But her biggest role turned out to be as Ronald Reagan?s adviser, counselor and protector when he was in public life, and later, serving as his chief caregiver after he became stricken by Alzheimer?s disease. Reagan died in June 2004. ?City News Service http://mynewsla.com/",

Hello, Just to be completely up-front, I'm a hypochondriac. My issues began six month's ago when my tongue seem to be swollen, and not working correctly. When I stuck it out it went slightly to the left without me wanting it to. I went to the Dr. and they said it could mean I had a brain tumor! I had a CT scan that day and the results were normal. Three days later I had an MRI and the results were normal. They told me I was stressed and had anxiety. After that I began to be healthier. I quit smoking, lost weight, began exercising, but still remained anxious. Since then I've thought I had lung cancer, heart problems, blood problems, basically you name it and I've thought i've had it. After five months of this I began seeing a therapist and taking anti-depressants, but I'm only in the first week. So that's the back story-Now, starting last week my coordination has been off. I feel clumsy and off balance. My right arm hurt, and my legs hurt a few days ago. It's hard to concentrate (unless I'm researching MS) and I'm just plain tired and a bit depressed. I don't know exactly how I came to think I may be showing initial symptoms of MS, but I'm here now and it's hard to push it out of my head. Is it possible that anxiety is just so strong that it can affect my motor coordination and balance, cause me to feel pain and tingles in my arm and legs, and make me feel totally exhausted? It seems that a lot of people with extreme anxiety end up on the MS fears because the symptoms are so similar in many ways. I apologize for the long post, but I wanted anyone that took the time to answer to have the complete picture. My Dr. will just laugh at me if I ask him because I've been in there so many times with deadly diseases ranging from COPD to Heart Failure, that he kindly reminds me I have health anxiety. My therapist thinks it's all magnification of my mind too. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Regards,",

It's crappy either way you look at it, but God forbid she has a preoperative MI with morbidity/mortality on a non emergent case, you know you will get eaten alive. If her family or she sues that is. And then of course she also needs diuresis for the CHF, better glucose control, etc. I had a patient I cancelled recently whose cardiologist had recently told him he needed a defibrillator, but it never happened for some reason.

My arteries are better than normal apart from one! I find this technical stuff hard to understand but I'm seeing the cardiologist next week. My problem is that we are going to Devon in July for just over a week and its a long journey, as we live in Norfolk. I don't want to go, I feel frightened about being away from my home and doctors. I also get tired very quickley sometimes and have a few chest pains. I also have fibromyagia and ostioarthritis which are painful and make me tired. I don't want to tell my husband, as he is really looking forward to it and I think we both need to get away for a break, but I still tense and anxious when I think about it. I am seeing the cardiologist next week for 4 month check-up, so I suppose I should ask him about it and talk to my GP, who is very approachable and kind.

I can understand your concern. Since you had valvular heart disease in the past, we must rule out heart related diseases like heart failure or coronary artery disease (CAD) for your current symptoms. Because heart failure and CAD are common after valvular heart disease and cause similar symptoms like breathlessness on exertion and chest pain. So get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test) first. You may need diuretics and other cardiac supportive drugs on the basis of these reports. Don't worry, you will be alright with appropriate treatment. Consult doctor and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

Photo illustration by Meredith Rizzo/NPR I've been itching to get a standing desk. After all, America's sitting itself into an early grave. Sitting is the new smoking. Clearly, a standing desk would stop me from sitting, and standing is just so much better for you than sitting, right? Contrary to popular belief, science does not say so. Too much sitting increases heart failure risk and disability risk, and shortens life expectancy, studies have found. But according to an analysis published Wednesday of 20 of the best studies done so far, there's little evidence that workplace interventions like the sit-stand desk or even the flashier pedaling or treadmill desks will help you burn lots more calories, or prevent or reverse the harm of sitting for hours on end. ""What we actually found is that most of it is, very much, just fashionable and not proven good for your health,"" says Dr. Jos Verbeek, a health researcher at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health. Verbeek says that the studies he and his co-authors analyzed came to conflicting conclusions about whether sit-stand desks reduce sitting time. Even the best research available wasn't great, the researchers write in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The studies were either too small to be significant, the scientists say, or were poorly designed. For example, most were not randomized controlled trials, and the longest study followed participants for only six months. In fact, there isn't really any evidence that standing is better than sitting, Verbeek adds. The extra calories you burn from standing over sitting for a day are barely enough to cover a couple of banana chips. ""The idea you should be standing four hours a day? There's no real evidence for that,"" he says. ""I would say that there's evidence that standing can be bad for your health."" A 2005 study in Denmark showed prolonged standing at work led to a higher hospitalization risk for enlarged veins. But standing doesn't have to be harmful, says Lucas Carr, a behavioral medicine professor at the University of Iowa who was not involved in the meta-analysis. He thinks as long as you stand in moderation, you can still reap some benefits. ""The health benefits of standing are not well-known,"" Carr agrees. ""But you're going to burn more calories standing than sitting. I know it's not a tremendous amount."" Still, he says, ""those calories every day over many years will add up."" Carr says the finding of the Cochrane review doesn't mean that standing desks and variations are useless. It just means there hasn't been enough study of the desks to say either way. ""The state of the science is definitely early,"" he says. ""There needs to be longer studies with more people to get a good sense these desks actually cause people to stand."" Carr thinks there is the the potential for sit-stand desks to prove useful in preventing healthy office workers from becoming unhealthy. Verbeek is less optimistic. Just because the standing desk or the pedaling desk is in the cubicle doesn't mean people will get out of the chair and use it. ""Changing behavior is very difficult,"" Verbeek says. He thinks redesigning work environments might be a better way to go. ""For example, organize a printer in the corridor that's further away from your desk,"" he says.

Diabetes ? causing blindness in a minimum of 14,000 people every year. Arthritis ? a very debilitating disease, especially crippling the elderly. Depression, Obesity, and Numerous other Diseases ***They say by the year 2020, Depression will be the #2 leading cause of death. It is no hidden fact that the Healthcare system is failing the American people. With billions being spent every year on health-care costs and prescription drugs, disease is at a higher rate than ever, with new diseases each year coming of the woodwork, so to say. ALSO, Emergency rooms are being filled at a higher rate every year with new strains of the flu breaking out in different parts of the world. THE BIG QUESTION IS WHY??????? As we study this subject, we will be covering the following: 1: WHY ARE PEOPLE SICK? 2: WHY IS THERE DISEASE? GOD TELLS US: ?...the curse causeless shall not come.? (Proverbs 26:2) Some of the curses dealing with disease mentioned in the Bible are found in the following verses: (Deut. 28:22, 27, 35; Lev 26:16; and Deut. 28:61) THEY ARE: 1. Pestilence =infections, deadly disease like AIDS (vs: 22) 2. Consumption =tuberculosis OR a wasting of flesh (vs: 22) 3. Fever (vs: 22) 4. Inflammation =Edema; anything ending in citis like bursitis, arthritis, etc. (vs: 22) 5. Extreme Burning = bones; heartburn; etc. (vs: 22) 5. Blasting = to prevent from growing like dwarf?s 6. Botch = a swelling on the skin; growth; ulcers; tumors (vs: 27) 7. Emerods =Hemorrhoids (vs: 27) 8. Scab =psoriasis, eczema, shingles, etc. (vs: 27) 9. Itch =Scabies; athlete?s foot; dandruff; seborrhea; etc. (vs: 27) 10. Madness = Schizophrenia (vs: 28) 11. Blindness =loss of sight (vs: 28) 12. Astonishment of Heart = heart problems (vs: 28) 13. Smitten in the Knees = knee problems (vs: 35) 14. Smitten in the legs = leg problems; gait problems (vs: 35) 15. A Sore Botch =painful swellings, painful ulcers, and painful tumors (vs: 35) 16. A Trembling Heart = heart failure; heart attack; cardiac arrest (vs: 35) 17. Failing Eyes =vision problems like glaucoma or cataracts (vs: 65) 18. Sorrow of Mind =any type of depression or worry (vs: 65) 19. Terror =fear; phobia; anxiety (Lev 26:16) 20. Burning Ague =chills; shivering (cold/flu); shock; etc. (Lev 26:16) 21. Disease & Sickness not listed ? examples are Mad Cow Disease and Swine Flu (Deut. 28:61) GOD SAID: ?...If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I WILL PUT NONE OF THESE DISEASES UPON THEE, WHICH I HAVE BROUGHT UPON THE EGYPTIANS...?

LET'S GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING AND SEE: ?And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.?(Gen 1:31) ?...GOD IS LOVE?(1 John 4:8) BIBLE: 3 John 2 ? ?Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.? Psalms 139:14 ? ?I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made...? Isaiah 45:12 ? ?I (God) have....created man...? NOTE:As all manufacturers provide an owner?s manual for their creation/product, our Heavenly Father has also provided an owner's manual for the human race (His creation). Unfortunately, when it comes to health, most humans, including those calling themselves Christians, for some reason feel that that is one area God does not cover, and they do not believe we need to consult the Word of God when it comes to our bodies and our health. So let's go to the Word of God and see what God tells us about our bodies and how to preserve our health. HOWEVER, THE WORD OF GOD SAYS: Matthew 4:4 ? ?...Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.? Exodus 15:26 ? ?... If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in His sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments,and keep all his statutes, I WILL PUT NONE OF THESE DISEASES UPON THEE, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.? Deuteronomy 28:15 ? ?But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee,and overtake thee.? Galatians 6:7 ? ?Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.? GOD IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW WE TAKE CARE OF OUR BODIES: ?What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.? (1 Corinthians 6:19-20) 1 Corinthians 10:31? ?Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.? HE TELLS US: Deuteronomy 30:19 ? ?I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live.? OUR POOR CHOICES CAN BRING AN EARLY DEATH TO OURSELVES Ecclesiastes 7:17 ? ?Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?? HOW MANY YEARS DID GOD PROMISE US? ?The days of our years are threescore years and ten (70); and if by reason of strength they be fourscore (80) years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off...? (Psalms 90:10) It is estimated that about 9 OUT OF 10 PEOPLE DIE PREMATURELY (90% of disease is R/T Diet & Lifestyle... (MM 225.2-.3) ***We're not referring to accidents here. We're talking about sickness & disease. IT IS NOT GOD'S PROVIDENCE FOR US TO BE SICK AND DIE PREMATURELY... ?The violation of physical law, with its consequent suffering and premature death, has so long prevailed that these results are regarded as the appointed lot of humanity; but God did not create the race in such a feeble condition. This state of things is not the work of Providence, but of man. NOTE: This is how long they lived eating flesh food. Those giving up flesh are living 100+ years. The violation of physical law, with its consequent suffering and premature death, has so long prevailed that these results are regarded as the appointed lot of humanity; but GOD DID NOT CREATE THE RACE IN SUCH A FEEBLE CONDITION. This state of things is not the work of Providence, but of man. It has been brought about by wrong habits,--by violating the laws that God has made to govern man's existence....? (CD 118.1) ?I wish you could read the daily papers of this country, and notice the accounts of how men in responsible positions have dropped dead while traveling or while at some entertainment. Never have the deaths of wealthy men in high life been so frequent as of late. This is the result of a violation of nature's laws. Cause is being followed by effect. The lifeforces are extinguished by indulgence. ?Heart failure,? say the physicians who attended these men at their death. Poor souls! They abused the Lord's wonderful machinery until it could endure no longer, and gave up the conflict. GOD DOES NOT WORK A MIRACLE TO KEEP IN MOTION THE MACHINERY THAT IS WORN OUT BY THE ABUSE PUT UPON IT.? {7MR 56.1} LET'S GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING AND SEE WHERE MAN WENT WRONG: ?And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.? (Gen 1:29) ?Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.? (Genesis 3:18) ?In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground...? (Genesis 3:18) NOW GOING DOWN TO THE DAYS OF NOAH ?And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female. Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.? (Genesis 7:1-3) ?Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.? (Genesis 9:3) MAN'S LIFESPAN BEFORE FLESH GIVEN BECAUSE OF THE FLOOD IN NOAH'S DAY: ?And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.?(Genesis 5:31) MAN'S LIFESPAN AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF FLESH FOOD DUE TO THE FLOOD: ?And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah. And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.? (Genesis 11:24-25) 29 yrs. +119 yrs. = 148 yrs. old ***NOW IT IS TRUE,God did give man permission to eat flesh food after the flood. BUT, IT WAS NEVER HIS ORIGINAL DESIGN. WHEN HE GAVE PERMISSION FOR THIS NEW DIET, HE HAD RESTRICTIONS TO ONLY CLEAN ANIMALS. (See Genesis 7:1-3; Leviticus 11:1-23 and Deut. 14) EIGHT RULES FOR EATING FLESH: 1. Must Be Clean(Leviticus 11/Deuteronomy 14) 2. No Fat(Leviticus 3:17) 3. No Blood(Leviticus 3:17) 4. No Blemish(Leviticus 3:1) 5. Not Strangled(Acts 15:20) 6. Cannot Be Cooked In Its Mother's Milk (Deuteronomy 14:21) (example: No Stroganoff) 7. Not Dying of Itself(Deuteronomy 14:21) 8. Must Be Eaten By The Third Day (Leviticus 19:5-7) However, the introduction of FLESH FOOD CAUSED MAN'S LIFE SPAN TO DECREASE DRASTICALLY. Today, in a documentary called 'Forks Over Knives', MEDICAL SCIENCE IS NOW SAYING IF YOU WANT TO REVERSE DISEASE AND ADD YEARS TO YOUR LIFE, YOU MUST CUT OUT ALL FLESH FROM THE DIET... WHY??? ***The Bible tells us that God declares the end from the beginning. (Isaiah 46:9-10) WHAT DID HE TELL US REGARDING FLESH FOODS IN THE LAST DAYS? ?...in the latter days there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood. Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.? (Hosea 3:5-4:3) LANGUISH = to die from sickness or disease ?Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself...? (Deuteronomy 14:21) TODAY: ? COWS ARE MAD ? CHICKENS HAVE THE FLU ? FISH ARE FULL OF MERCURY http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/19/all-fish-in-us-steams-hav_n_263334.html SOME QUOTES ABOUT THE DANGERS OF EATING FLESH FOOD: ?Flesh was never the best food; but its use is now doubly objectionable, since disease in animals is so rapidly increasing. THOSE WHO USE FLESH FOODS LITTLE KNOW WHAT THEY ARE EATING. Often if they could see the animals when living and know the quality of the meat they eat, they would turn from it with loathing. People are continually eating flesh that is filled with tuberculous and cancerous germs. Tuberculosis, cancer, and other fatal diseases are thus communicated.? {MH 313.2} ?The effects of a flesh diet may not be immediately realized; but this is no evidence that it is not harmful. Few can be made to believe that it is the meat they have eaten which has poisoned their blood and caused their suffering. MANY DIE OF DISEASES WHOLLY DUE TO MEAT EATING, while the real cause is not suspected by themselves or by others.? {MH 315.1} ?THE LIABILITY TO TAKE DISEASE IS INCREASED TENFOLD BY MEAT EATING...Your safest course is to let meat alone.? (CH 70.2) ?...Flesh food is injurious to health...? (MH 315.2) SO IF ONE CHOOSES TO GIVE UP FLESH FOOD, WHAT SHOULD THEY EAT IN ITS PLACE? ?In order to know what are the best foods, we must study God's original plan for man's diet. He who created man and who understands his needs appointed Adam his food. . . . Grains, fruits, nuts, and vegetables constitute the diet chosen for us by our Creator.? {CG 380.1} ?Grains, fruits, nuts, and vegetables constitute the diet chosen for us by our Creator. These foods prepared in as simple and natural a manner as possible, are the most healthful and nourishing. They impart a strength, a power of endurance, and a vigor of intellect...? (MH 296.1) ?Grains, fruits, nuts, and vegetables, in proper combination, contain all the elements of nutrition;and when properly prepared, they constitute the diet that best promotes both physical and mental strength.? (Ed 204.3) ?The grains, with fruits, nuts, and vegetables, contain all the nutritive properties necessaryto make good blood. These elements are not so well or so fully supplied by a flesh diet. Had the use of flesh been essential to health and strength, animal food would have been included in the diet appointed man in the beginning.? (CD 396.1) http://newstartclub.com/recipes",

Diabetes drugs containing saxagliptin and alogliptin may raise the risk of heart failure, particularly in patients with heart or kidney disease, U.S. health officials warned Tuesday. Drugs containing these ingredients are Onglyza (saxagliptin), Kombiglyze XR (saxagliptin and metformin extended release), Nesina (alogliptin), Kazano (alogliptin and metformin) and Oseni (alogliptin and pioglitazone), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. People with type 2 diabetes who use these drugs should not stop taking them without consulting with their doctor, the FDA said. The agency added that patients on these drugs should contact their doctor if they develop signs and symptoms of heart failure, including: Unusual shortness of breath during daily activities. Difficulty breathing when lying down. Tiredness, weakness or fatigue. Weight gain with swelling of the ankles, feet, legs or stomach. The FDA said it?s adding new warnings to the drug labels about these safety concerns. Both saxagliptin and alogliptin are in a class of drugs called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, which along with diet and exercise are used to try to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes. The FDA said its warning was based on results of two large trials done involving patients with heart disease. Both trials found that more patients taking drugs containing saxagliptin or alogliptin were hospitalized for heart failure than patients receiving a placebo. In the saxagliptin trial, 3.5 percent of patients receiving the drug were hospitalized for heart failure, compared with 2.8 percent of patients receiving a placebo. This means that 35 out of every 1,000 patients taking the drug were hospitalized for heart failure, compared with 28 out of every 1,000 patients not taking it. Risk factors included a history of heart failure or kidney impairment, the FDA reported. In the alogliptin trial, 3.9 percent of patients taking the drug were hospitalized for heart failure, compared with 3.3 percent receiving a placebo. That?s the same as 39 out of every 1,000 patients, compared with 33 out of every 1,000 patients, the agency said. The FDA said it?s asking doctors to consider discontinuing medications containing saxagliptin and alogliptin in patients who develop heart failure. If blood sugar is not well-controlled with current treatments, other diabetes drugs may be needed, the agency said. Dr. Minisha Sood is director of inpatient diabetes at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She said: ?At this time, it is unclear whether this is a ?class effect? which applies to all drugs in the DPP-4 inhibitor category or only saxagliptin and alogliptin. It also remains unclear at this time whether this advice applies to patients at relatively low risk for heart disease.? Sood said there?s some research indicating that DPP-4 inhibitors actually reduce cardiovascular problems in some patients. ?So, the ultimate effect of this drug class on cardiac events remains to be seen and further study is needed,? she said. This class of drugs ?remains a good option for many patients with diabetes given that they are oral medications with largely tolerable side effects and they effectively reduce glucose levels,? Sood said. Patients should discuss any symptoms or side effects with their health care provider before changing medications, she added.

(NASDAQ: IMMY), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary compounded drug therapies, today announced plans to introduce new patent-pending tiopronin and potassium citrate delayed release (DR) compounded formulations that may be prescribed by physicians as a lower cost therapeutic alternative to FDA-approved Thiola. The formulations are expected to be available to prescribers in April 2016. Thiola , made of tiopronin as its active drug ingredient, is commonly prescribed for the prevention of cystine kidney stone formation in patients who do not respond to dietary changes and increased fluids. According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders, in addition to chelating medications such as tiopronin, potassium citrate is often co-prescribed and taken separately to make the urine more alkaline, potentially reducing cystine crystallization and stone formation. Imprimis believes that its patent-pending compounded combination of tiopronin and potassium citrate may improve patient compliance. Additionally, FDA-approved Thiola is only available as a 100 mg tablet and many cystinuria patients take 10 or more tablets per day. The company's formulation is customizable, allowing physicians to choose a more precise dosage based on the needs of their patients. Customization of this medication could potentially reduce the number of capsules taken daily for this chronic condition. Cystinuria is an inherited disease that causes stones made of the amino acid cystine to form in the kidneys, bladder and/or urethra. There are an estimated 10,000 to 12,000 patients in the U.S. who suffer from this chronic condition and 4,000 to 5,000 of them may be candidates for Thiola . In 2014, Retrophin LLC and its CEO at the time, Martin Shkreli , acquired the licensing rights of Thiola from Mission Pharmacal Company and increased the price of Thiola 2,000% from $1.50 per tablet to $30 per tablet , resulting in some cystinuria patients having to grapple with costs of this therapy exceeding more than an estimated $100,000 per year . Since Mr. Shkreli's departure from Retrophin, the high price of Thiola remains intact. Imprimis' compounded alternative containing tiopronin, the active drug ingredient in Thiola, and potassium citrate, may reduce the cost of therapy for cystinuria patients by more than 70%. ""Due to the recent increase in the price of Thiola, many cystinuria patients have been switched to an alternative treatment such as captopril, which is FDA-approved for hypertension and heart failure. The off-label use of captopril in cystinuria patients without hypertension increases the risk of excessive blood pressure lowering, dizziness and fatigue. The availability of Imprimis' new customizable compounded drug will provide patients with access to an affordable choice containing both the active ingredient tiopronin and potassium citrate, which are often taken separately with tiopronin,"" stated Dr. Christian Mende , a nephrologist and clinical professor at University of California at San Diego. Mark L. Baum , CEO of Imprimis stated, ""After we made alternative compounded formulations available for physicians and patients who were dealing with the 5,000% Daraprim? price hike, another old off-patent branded drug that had no generic competition, we were contacted by thousands of patients requesting help with over 100 FDA-approved drugs that also experienced massive and nearly overnight price hikes. We heard the horror stories of patients with access problems directly connected to pricing issues. Cystinuria patients in need of Retrophin's Thiola were among the most frequent requests we received because in many cases, they were being switched to non-tiopronin based drugs. As in the Daraprim case, we are planning to offer lower cost customizable compounded therapeutic alternatives for physicians and patients. We expect to continue to address the needs of patients with additional new formulations during 2016."" Mr. Baum concluded, ""Our Imprimis Cares program is focused on patient access. To the average American who needs an FDA-approved drug they cannot afford because of the legal and predatory pricing policies of some pharmaceutical companies, or because they have an unaffordable co-pay or a $6,000 annual drug benefit deductible, the drug they need is in effect commercially unavailable for economic reasons. Last week, the FDA's Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, discussed during her testimony at the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, that approximately 12% of branded drugs have not and may not face generic competition. This competition vacuum creates artificial legal monopolies for some companies, which has led to the massive price hikes we have seen over the past few years. We are responding to the needs of real people with real and immediate problems by offering therapeutically relevant low cost solutions compared to some high priced FDA-approved drugs that simply do not, and according to the FDA, likely will not have any competition. We believe our plan to help decrease drug costs for patients and payors is consistent with our mission, vision and values and will in turn increase long term value for our shareholders."" Imprimis is reviewing partnership opportunities to clinically develop proprietary formulations in its Imprimis Cares program.

They are all very thrilled and proud of me for my weight loss success and fully support my atkins woe. It's been awesome to have their support :heart: But here's my situation... I decided to shift things recently to break my first EVER stall and I'm seeing a bit of movement over the last week in as much as I'm not bouncing around ine a 5-6 pound range each and everyday and am feeling really good. I've taken a hf approach this week and have been diligently tracking everything. In addition to being T2DM, PCOS, HTN sufferer (excellently controlled on all fronts) I am also a cardiac patient having had a major LAD MI 7 years ago, no reoccurrance. At their age, my parents are going to be fearful of seeing me eat hf like I do and will worry because like many people they believe fat is bad. I'm not likely to change their thinking and see no reason to try...they are both fit active seniors who have always enjoyed good health and healthy weight. I think it would be disrespectful to start dissing their woe when it has served them well. How would you tactfully and caringly assert your own needs while not causing anyone to feel uncomfortable. We will be sharing a 2 bedroom lodge so not entirely private forme. Your insight and experience is, as always, very much appreciated :)",

The following drugs are affected by the new label: Onglyza (saxagliptin), Kombiglyze XR (saxagliptin and metformin extended release), Nesina (alogliptin), Kazano (alogliptin and metformin) and Oseni (alogliptin and pioglitazone). Heart failure is more likely to occur in patients with a history of kidney disease or heart problems. The warning was based on the results of two major clinical trials showing that patients taking saxagliptin or alogliptin had a higher risk of heart failure compared to those who received placebos. In one of the trials, 3.5 percent of patients taking the diabetes drugs were hospitalized for heart failure; 3.9 percent were hospitalized in the other study. ?The studies are worthwhile and they are bringing a risk factor to the forefront,? said Dr. Gerald Bernstein, former president of the American Diabetes Association, according to Newsday. Bernstein, an endocrinologist and coordinator at the Friedman Diabetes Program, a division of Northwell Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, says the drugs work by increasing the amount of insulin in the body in response to high blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which the body no longer uses insulin properly, developing insulin resistance. Cells need insulin as a signal in order to take up glucose. Patients with type 2 diabetes develop insulin resistance, where the body does not utilize insulin properly. The drugs affected by the warning belong to a class of drugs known as dipeptidyl peptidase inhibitors (DPP-4), which can help lower blood sugar when used in combination with diet and exercise.

Thank you. Ozchrissy, back when I had the chemo and transplant, a lot of it was still experimental at that point. They now have a better idea of the thresholds the body can handle. Same with heart meds, they now have a better track on how much is needed to be most effective, etc. Let's face it- we know we are putting toxins in our body, but it beats the alternative. I always knew I had a higher risk of a secondary cancer or a failure of some sort, but I've gotten an additional 23 years out of it to date, so I'm not complaining. I was pregnant with my only son when diagnosed with cancer and he's now 23 and getting married this fall. I've told the doctors recently, if I had to have cancer again or the heart failure, I'd pick the heart failure. There is nothing they can do to me now that would be worse than what I've already gone through. I hope your cancer is in remission and not causing you any issues. These experiences make us re-prioritize our lives don't they?!! Jo",

Jun 20, 2016) ? Theravance Biopharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: TBPH) (?Theravance Biopharma?) today announced that GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) and Innoviva, Inc. (Innoviva) have disclosed positive top-line results from the pivotal Phase 3 FULFIL study of the Closed Triple (the combination of flutiCASone furoate, umeclidinium, and vilanterol) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Data demonstrated superiority for the Closed Triple as compared to Symbicort? Turbohaler? in improving lung function and health-related quality of life in COPD patients. The Closed Triple is one of the drug development programs for which Theravance Biopharma has an economic interest in future payments that may be made by GSK or one of its affiliates pursuant to its agreements with Innoviva (formerly Theravance, Inc.). Should the Closed Triple be successfully developed and commercialized, Theravance Biopharma is entitled to receive an 85% economic interest in the royalties paid by GSK on worldwide net sales. Those royalties are upward-tiering from 6.5% to 10%. Additionally, GSK is responsible for all development costs related to the Closed Triple with no costs being borne by Theravance Biopharma. In an announcement made on June 20, 2016, GSK and Innoviva stated that the FULFIL study met its two co-primary endpoints, demonstrating statistically significant improvements compared with twice-daily Symbicort Turbohaler (budesonide/formoterol 400/12mcg) in both lung function as measured by trough FEV1 (171mL, 95% confidence interval [148, 194] p < 0.001), and health-related quality of life as measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) (-2.2 units, 95% confidence interval [-3.5, -1.0] p < 0.001), at the end of the 24-week study period. The proportion of patients who responded with the minimum clinically important difference in SGRQ (-4 units) was 50% on FF/UMEC/VI and 41% on budesonide/formoterol. Additionally, GSK and Innoviva announced that the safety profile for the Closed Triple at both 24 weeks and the 52-week extension was consistent with the known profile of the individual medicines and their combinations. GSK has indicated that findings from the FULFIL study support its plans to submit regulatory filings for the approval of the Closed Triple for the treatment of COPD in both the U.S. and EU by the end of 2016. Additional top-line FULFIL study results announced by GSK and Innoviva include: Most common adverse events across both treatment arms at 24 and 52 weeks were nasopharyngitis, headache and COPD worsening. At 24 weeks, the incidence of investigator-reported serious adverse events was 5.4% and 5.7% for FF/UMEC/VI and budesonide/formoterol, respectively. This included worsening of COPD (1.3% and 2.3%); pneumonia (1.0% and 0.3%); and cardiac disorders (0.3% and 1.0%), respectively. At 52 weeks, the incidence of investigator-reported serious adverse events was 10.0% for FF/UMEC/VI and 12.7% for budesonide/formoterol, respectively. This included worsening of COPD (2.4% and 9.1%); pneumonia (1.9% and 1.8%); and cardiac disorders (1.4% and 0.9%), respectively. The Closed Triple combination therapy represents a unique approach to COPD treatment by seeking to combine the activity of three molecules with different mechanisms of action in a single delivery device. The combination treatment includes: fluticasone furoate (FF), an inhaled corticosteroid; umeclidinium (UMEC), a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA); and vilanterol (VI), a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA). This combination has been formulated to be delivered once-daily in GSK?s Ellipta? dry powder inhaler. The FULFIL study compared FF/UMEC/VI with budesonide and formoterol, an ICS/LABA combination delivered twice-daily in the Turbohaler dry powder inhaler. GSK and Innoviva intend to submit full results from the FULFIL study, including data from secondary endpoints and the 52-week extension study, for presentation at a scientific congress. In addition to the FULFIL study, the ongoing clinical development program for the Closed Triple in COPD includes the IMPACT study, a second Phase 3 trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the combination treatment compared to existing COPD therapies. Results of the IMPACT study are expected in 20171.

Kansas State's 2016 season will be here before you know it, but if the wait still seems too long, you can take comfort that the season is only 42 days away, as noted in BracketCat's countdown and #42 fullback Kade True. As expected, all the news in college football right now is focused on Big 12 expansion. The conspiracy theorists were out in full force yesterday as Texas, quickly followed by Texas Tech, publicly stated interest in exploring the addition of Houston to the conference. Meanwhile, BYU officially notified the Big 12 of its interest in joining the conference, possibly as a football-only member, if needed. BYU's stated goal is full-membership, but the university is willing to make a concession, if needed (Jake Trotter, ESPN). Big 12 expansion was the topic of the day in two different Q&A sessions. First, ESPN's Trotter, in his Big 12 Mailbag, suggested the Big 12 may actually be better off than the Pac-12 right now. Next, the Wichita Eagle's Kellis Robinett gave all the expansion talk some much-needed local flavor in his weekly K-State Q&A. His introduction is a good summary of all the expansion shenanigans so far. In all the excitement about expansion, only a few people (include several in our own commentariat) have suggested that expansion is not a good idea. Ty Duffy of The Big Lead also weighs in, noting that expansion kinda stinks. But he's a Michigan fan, so what the heck does he know? Anybody who watched Kansas State football last season had to know the defense was lacking a certain something, or more correctly, a certain someone. That would be Dante Barnett, who is eager to return to the field and make a significant mark (Robinett, Eagle). The men's basketball team will host a practice sesssion open to the public on August 6, just before the start of the team's 10-day trip to Europe. The practice will begin at 2:30 and feature six returning players and six newcomers. Following the session, the players and Bruce Weber will speak to the crowd. The tragic death of Oklahoma State's Tyrek Coger has cast a pall over Stillwater. As the Oklahoma State community mourns his loss, there have also been questions around the circumstances that may have led to Coger's sudden collapse. Officials have now revealed that Coger's death came after an intense workout in hot conditions. But the heat is not believed to the cause of death. Coger appears to have had an enlarged heart, specifically """"cardiomegaly, with left ventricular hypertrophy."""" He had passed earlier medical tests and demonstrated fitness for athletic activity, but Oklahoma State intends to review its policies with respect to training in extreme conditions (Ken Miller, Associated Press (via the Topeka Capital-Journal)).",

The reason I quit going was that I felt it was killing me and I couldn't get the nephrologist, Dr. Biggs, whom I had never met, to give me a anti-hypertensive that I needed or see me in the clinic or her office. I had been in the hospital for 2 weeks in November and while I was there the nephrologist before her, also the director in my facility that I normally do dialysis in, fired me while I dialyzing in the hospital. (its a long story, but basically I couldn't get him to hammer down a plan to get AVF after they had pulled my PD catheter. I had come down with peritonitis the day before I was to start PD training). So I stopped going to dialysis, but went back to Dr. Gold, whom I had an about with in June 2015, and had an appointment made out for 6 months. So I see Dr. Gold, and I am honest about not going to dialysis. I show up to two appointments and I had gotten my AVF done in January and thankfully my cvc out in Feb. We discussed getting back on dialysis even though I don't feel bad. I told him the only way I would go I could go incenter again was if I was on a wait list or for training. He told me that we could arrange that. I then go to Davita (I had started out dialyzing here, but I changed to Fresineus, mainly because I could). I fill out my paperwork and the receptionist asked if I had any questions. I tell her that I was promised to be put on the waiting list for home hemo and the discussion I had with Dr. Gold. She gets the administrator to come talk to me. She disappears after I ask my question, and then says the Dr. Biggs (the MD at this facility), says I have to be ""compliant"" for three months before I can do home hemo. I am so frustrated and incensed, I can barely speak. There is something that makes dialysis the way they do it incenter intolerable to me. Its not just the depressing atmosphere, the irritating hum of the lights, or the insanity of the beeping machines, its also the IDH I have almost immediately after they put me on and several times throughout, the worst being at 2 hours in, I almost always pass out and then they have to refill to get my bp up enough to let me leave (my bp is usually high or very very high when I come in). I leave with a migraine, my head feels like its got an angry beehive in it, my bones feel like they are full of shards of glass, I am literally useless from 12-20 hours. There is no way I can do this for three months. For one thing I have a child to take care of. I have tried to make an appointment with this Dr. Biggs (whom I have yet to lay eyes on) to discuss her requirements and to maybe let her know the problem I am having with dialysis so maybe we could work on fixing it at least to make it tolerable. I feel that if I ignored my body and tried to do this for three months I will surely die. Since December I haven't been the hospital once. I am not retaining fluid, and for the first time since I started dialysis last August I am not anemic. I have congestive heart failure, and left ventricular hypertrophy, I am only 4'10"" and have IDH almost every treatment, I can feel my cardiovascular system struggle when they drop my blood pressure real low. In November, the treatment that the doctor fired me, I was way below my dry weight when I showed up yet he insisted that they remove 4kg from me (I only weighed 60kg at the time, and was 53kg when I stopped going in December). My bp went from 240/180 to 60/40! I seriously had three hindu angels in different colored saris come for me. Since then I am kinda terrified every time I even think about going to dialysis I get nervous. Anyways, is this normal, what should I do? I can't go on doing dialysis like this, does it always make you feel this terrible? Oh, yeah, I still have like 10% of my kidney function left.",

Technology & the Business of Medicine The hamburger is a delicious part of the western diet. And it seems no matter how many health risks it?s associated with, from cancer to Alzheimer?s disease and heart failure, Americans are unwilling to put their beloved sandwich down: They consume an estimated 14 billion burgers each year, The Huffington Post reported. Could new research from the University of Glasgow finally get people to reduce their intake? The study, published in Aging, suggests overdoing it on red meat could accelerate the body?s biological age. Unlike chronological age, which is the number of years a person has lived, some experts suggest biological age is tied closely to a person?s risk for age-related diseases such as dementia, Live Science reported. One of the factors that determine biological age is the amount of serum phosphate in the body, particles that increase when people eat meat. According to researchers, even a moderate raise in serum phosphate levels can speed up biological aging, and even more so for men living in poor areas. For the study, researchers analyzed the eating habits of more than 600 people who lived in either the most or least deprived areas of Glasgow, Scotland. To assess how red meat consumption affected their biological age, researchers measured for serum phosphate and biological age markers, including DNA content and telomere length. Telomeres are end caps on DNA strands that ultimately preserve chromosomes and protect them from deteriorating. Results showed phosphate levels among men living in the most deprived parts of Glasgow were directly related to how often they ate red meat. Researchers speculate that this excess consumption is due to this group?s limited access to healthy, quality foods; they have more access to meat than they fresh fruits and vegetables. In the U.S., this is often referred to as a food desert. Researchers also found that high phosphate levels were linked with reduced kidney function and underlying mild to moderate chronic kidney disease. ?The data in this study provides evidence for a mechanistic link between high intake of phosphate and age-related morbidities tied to socio-economic status,? researcher Paul Shiels said in a statement. ?Our observations indicate that elevated red meat consumption has adverse effects amongst deprived males, who already have a poor diet and eat less fruit and vegetables than recommended.? Phosphate is naturally found in many of our everyday foods. They help enhance flavor and moistness in deli meats, cheese, and baked goods. It?s also needed to help cells work properly. However, intestinal absorption isn?t regulated, and high supplementation of phosphates via red meat consumption can elevate levels of serum phosphate. At this point, meat eaters face adverse health consequences and even early death. ?Strikingly, many of the subjects had kidney function indicative of incipient or early onset chronic kidney disease,? Shiels said. ?It has also not escaped our attention that red meat product quality and preservation may have an impact upon the diets of the most deprived and their associated health.? Experts on the Meat Advisory Panel criticized the study, calling it an ?elementary theory? based on ?speculation? and not ?solid evidence.? For their part, the researchers did say their study was limited in that it looks at a small sample of people and doesn?t differentiate between the type of red meat consumed. They conclude more research needs to be done. Dietitian Dr. Carrie Ruxton told The Huffington Post that red meat helps support normal health because it?s a valuable source of iron, B vitamins, and vitamin D. ?Dietary phosphate comes from a wide variety of sources?as noted by the authors themselves in the paper. Therefore, using a cross-sectional ?snapshot? of diet and blood samples as was the case in this study, it is impossible to say which individual dietary component was responsible for people?s raised blood phosphate levels,?

While many residents prefer to stay indoors to beat the heat, here?s what our readers have to say on what needs to be done to keep safe and cool during summer:Consume lighter foodWith Vizag recording sizzling temperatures and high humidity, I have resorted to light food items including cold beverages and snacks containing low fat. One can also avoid exercising in the morning and hit the gym after sunset. Also, try to avoid alcohol and hot beverages that promotes precipitation. Moreover, the government must increase rest periods for workers at least during the peak noon hours. Supervisors should also remind the workers to have enough water. Moreover, to prevent the mounting death rates in the city due to heatwave, administrators must ensure that residents stay indoors at least when the sun is overhead and that the water kiosks are places at regular intervals.Rohit Killada, StudentResidents should stay indoorsIt is better not to go out between 10 am and 4 pm unless it is mandatory. One must always carry a bottle of water and a cap or scarf when venturing out during the morning hours. Avoid cool drinks and ice creams and instead opt for coconut water or fresh fruit juices. The government should arrange for mobile rescue centres at various places to treat people hit by sun strokes. Children and old people should be careful during this season and make sure that the body water levels are not reduced in the form of excess sweat.Simma Kavya, StudentArrange mobile medical centresThe mercury levels are rising all over India and the state and central governments should take some steps to spread awareness in rural and urban areas about the precautions to be taken during the summer season. The administrative officials should also arrange for mobile medical centres at all the busy places in the city like bus stops, railways stations, and shopping malls. The ways to prevent heat strokes should be displayed at all the busy places.Mahesh Mahe, StudentDrink lots of waterWith the temperatures already touching alarmingly levels in April, it is high time the district administration takes measures to prevent sunstroke deaths. Awareness through the media should be created for advising elderly persons not to venture out between 11 am and 4 pm. Also, free chilled water should be available at all public places. Drinking lots of water and wearing cotton dresses as well as avoiding heavy food are the ways I am keeping cool this summer.R Sekar, PSU employeeCreate sun-shadesThe sweltering summer temperatures have already turned the city into a furnace. Vizagites should drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration and wear light and loose-fitting clothes. Eat at least five cups of fruit juice everyday for better nutrition. The district administration should also provide sun-shades at regular intervals and ensure that adequate medical services are available in every corner of the city.Duvvuri Sirisha, StudentDepleting green cover leading to high temperaturesVizag is fortunate to have a moderate climate compared to any other city in Andhra Pradesh thanks to its proximity to the sea and the greenery surrounding the city. However, deforestation of the green hills in the name of development is gradually destroying the natural balance. In the last 4-5 years, the maximum temperature of the Port City has gone above 40 degrees from the normal 33-34 degrees. In addition to it, the cyclone too has taken away a major chunk of our greenery. This year the temperature may rise further. However, we can take some efforts to ensure that we are safe from the scorching heat. I have painted our terrace with a light colour due to which the temperature inside the house has reduced significantly. Drink lots of water to keep the body hydrated.

Man Dies After Consuming 60 Gallons of Ice Cream (Photo),"Juan Pablo Iglesiaz A man who had a rare eating disorder has died after eating an alarming 60 gallons of Ice Cream. Juan Pablo Iglesiaz, a 36-year-old man from New Mexico, has met an untimely death several hours after being brought into the emergency room after a heart failure possibly caused by hypothermia. The man who suffered from an extreme case of binge eating disorder had eaten an estimated 60 gallons of ice cream before succumbing to heart failure caused by a lethal drop of his body core temperature, believe experts. ?He had only been working here for a few days? explained Eleonora Brimmes, the convenient store assistant manager where Juan Iglesiaz had been hired 36 hours prior to his death and where he was found unconscious moments before being transported to the emergency room. ?He was a good employee nonetheless, this a great tragedy? she told local reporters, visibly saddened by the whole affair."" she said Eleonora Brimmes Juan Pablo Iglesiaz is believed to have suffered from an extreme case of binge eating disorder in which the victim loses all self-control on the quantities of food he is ingurgitating, explains Dr. Alan Rushmore of the Mountain View Regional Medical Center in Las Cruces. ?It is a sad thing he was not diagnosed before his tragic death,? he explains. ?Death rarely occurs from binge eating disorder (BED) but can have damaging effects on a person?s health in the long term if not treated properly. He visibly suffered from a very extreme case of BED as it seems he was unable to stop eating the ice cream, even though he must have suffered from intense shivering and mental confusion moments before he lost consciousness.? The family of the victim is threatening to sue the ice cream company because there was no legal notice on the package that warned of the dangers of eating ice cream in large quantities. ?My son was terribly sick but he was also very smart. If there had been a notice on the package that ice cream could cause death, he would have never eaten so much. All this could have been prevented if the company had taken its responsibilities,? she told reporters in tears. ?They are clearly to blame in this case and we definitely intend to sue them for what they have done to my son? Although binge eating disorder is the most common eating disorder in adults, an ongoing habit of consuming large amounts of food in a short period of time ultimately leads to weight gain and obesity but is rarely deadly. As of January 2015, Lisdexamfetamine is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States specifically for the treatment of binge eating.",

It happens!). Ali Medeiros addresses the situation of economic and political crisis that shatters the lives of all of us. The media continually bombards us with news of a negative scenario, which tends to get worse and worse, until this impeachment situation is defined as soon as possible. No matter what the outcome of this pendenga, what matters is that this problem is resolved without further delay so that foreign investment back to Brazil, the job becomes to flourish, and the economy back on track. Or, if the impeachment is not approved, the PT returned to power, and be what God wants. I have just read in The Globe today, on page 24, the PLP 268 Project, with respect to state-owned enterprises, it was amended by the House. The proposed management of pension funds will be discussed next week. Let's see what rabbit will come out of this hat. That is, we are all, some more than others, tense with so many uncertainties that arise in front of us, that affect our interests and our lives. Yesterday I was about to write on this subject, when I witnessed a family assault scene that left me very shaken. A recently fired his father's job, in a critical financial situation, lost control and attacked his wife and son, who complained about the lack of money, which did not allow the meeting of basic family needs. The police intervened, some people helped, and I was devastated after witnessing the scene. Newspapers are constantly portray corruption cases, investigations Wash Jet endless debates on impeachment and other negative issues, and the economic crisis deepens more and more. It all adds up, as the companion Medeiros, causes us stress and anxiety. But we need to keep our physical and emotional health. We need to healthier living standards. One of the key factors for this purpose is called ""gentrification"" which is the revitalization and recovery of slums in certain areas of large cities. Another is the internalization of the population, that is, the change in megacities inhabitants for medium and small cities. This is a process that is growing increasingly in the US since the 50s Large companies in the country are moving their headquarters and factories to small remote towns of the great centers. This results in an exceptional improvement standard of living of people who come to reside in more peaceful areas in wider and wooded homes, safer, quieter, less polluted, no congestion of vehicles and closer to workplaces. While this change does not happen, we need to have better living habits, such as listening to more music, walk more, exercise, dance and have a healthier diet. By the way, I transcribe below the excellent article ""Preventive against crisis,"" the cardiologist Jos? Kezen, published in the newspaper O Globo, of 09.06.2016, page 17. Adai ROSEMBAK Associate AAFBB, ANABB, AFABB-RS and ANAPLAB PREVENTIVE AGAINST CRISIS Today is the economy and politics that govern the media, the daily life and conversations of Brazilians. Impossible to be oblivious to the effects of the economic crisis in our daily life - unemployment, inflation, lower growth - and the rapid pace of change in politics. Also hard not to see that the turbulence facing Brazil have consequences that go beyond finance and the people cheer. The most perverse impacts may fall in the quality of our health - now and in the future. Thus countries with economic activity similar to ours. And that is what we are already experiencing in offices and clinics. A growing number of patients with anxiety symptoms (insomnia, irritability and fatigue), common complaints that invariably are related or were caused, even indirectly, by the slower pace of the economy. There decades researchers around the world are dedicated to scale as times of economic tightening impact on population health and act as a risk factor for several diseases, such as cardiovascular disease. A recent study shows that in the US the slowdown of the economy from 2008 brought minimal consequences to the health of Americans. The document comes to reveal that mortality is lower in periods of crisis. Incredible as it may seem, a 1% drop in the unemployment rate comes to coincide with decreases of up to 0.5% of the mortality rate of Americans. But this antagonistic behavior seems to be restricted to the most advanced economies. In other countries, such as Argentina, Greece and Russia, the negative health impacts were significant. We can expect similar performance in Brazil. In Argentina, the risk of heart attack increased by 5.4% between 1998 and 2002. During that time the neighboring country faced one of the worst economic times in its history - the end of currency parity with the dollar and ""corralito "". In Greece, doctors detected an increase in the number of hospitalizations for heart attacks between 2008 and 2012, in a study presented at the Heart Failure Congress-2014. The Greeks were one of the European nations most affected by the crisis of 2008. In Brazil, two indicators are on alert. IMS Health, consulting firm that audits the pharmaceutical market, has identified an increase of 12.6% in sales of antidepressants and mood stabilizers between March 2015 and February this year. History teaches that economics and health have always had very close connection. The relationship is not only the lack of resources for public health and the impact of epidemics in the pace of the country's activities, but also the need for a healthy population to support any development policy. Then review eating habits, give up sedentary lifestyle and adopt prevention as a rule are, yes, the first hour of action for any country to grow back. Jos? Kezen is a cardiologist",

Therapy Receives FDA Approval for Cardiogenic Shock After Heart Attack or Heart Surgery,"DANVERS, Mass., April 07, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD),a leading provider of breakthrough heart support technologies, today announcedthat it has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pre-Market Approval(PMA) for its Impella 2.5(TM), Impella CP?, Impella 5.0(TM) and Impella LD(TM)heart pumps to provide treatment of ongoing cardiogenic shock. In this setting,the Impella heart pumps stabilize the patient's hemodynamics, unload the leftventricle, perfuse the end organs and allow for recovery of the native heart. This latest approval adds to the prior FDA indication of Impella 2.5 for highrisk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or Protected PCI(TM), received inMarch 2015.With this approval, these are the first and only percutaneous temporaryventricular support devices that are FDA-approved as safe and effective for thecardiogenic shock indication, as stated below: The Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0 and Impella LD catheters, in conjunction with the Automated Impella Controller console, are intended for short-term use (<4 days for the Impella 2.5 and Impella CP and <6 days for the Impella 5.0 and Impella LD) and indicated for the treatment of ongoing cardiogenic shock that occurs immediately (<48 hours) following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or open heart surgery as a result of isolated left ventricular failure that is not responsive to optimal medical management and conventional treatment measures with or without an intra- aortic balloon pump. The intent of the Impella system therapy is to reduce ventricular work and to provide the circulatory support necessary to allow heart recovery and early assessment of residual myocardial function. The Impella products offer the unique ability to both stabilize the patient'shemodynamics before or during a PCI procedure and unload the heart, which allowsthe muscle to rest and potentially recover its native function. Heart recoveryis the ideal option for a patient's quality of life and as documented in severalclinical papers, has the ability to save costs for the healthcare system(1,2,3).Cardiogenic shock is a life-threatening condition in which the heart is suddenlyunable to pump enough blood and oxygen to support the body's vital organs. Forthis approval, it typically occurs during or after a heart attack or acutemyocardial infarction (AMI) or cardiopulmonary bypass surgery as a result of aweakened or damaged heart muscle. Despite advancements in medical technology,critical care guidelines and interventional techniques, AMI cardiogenic shockand post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PCCS) carry a high mortality risk and hasshown an incremental but consistent increase in occurrence in recent years inthe United States.""This approval sets a new standard for the entire cardiovascular community asclinicians continue to seek education and new approaches to effectively treatseverely ill cardiac patients with limited options and high mortality risk,""said William O'Neill, M.D., medical director of the Center for Structural HeartDisease at Henry Ford Hospital. ""The Impella heart pumps offer the ability toprovide percutaneous hemodynamic stability to high-risk patients in need ofrapid and effective treatment by unloading the heart, perfusing the end organsand ultimately, allowing for the opportunity to recover native heart function.""""Abiomed would like to recognize our customers, physicians, nurses, scientists,regulators and employees for their last fifteen years of circulatory supportresearch and clinical applications. This FDA approval marks a significantmilestone in the treatment of heart disease. The new medical field of heartmuscle recovery has begun,"" said Michael R. Minogue, President, Chairman andChief Executive Officer of Abiomed. ""Today, Abiomed only treats around 5% ofthis AMI cardiogenic shock patient population, which suffers one of the highestmortality risks of any patient in the heart hospital. Tomorrow, Abiomed will beable to educate and directly partner with our customers and establishappropriate protocols to improve the patient outcomes focused on native heartrecovery.""Abiomed Data Supporting FDA ApprovalThe data submitted to the FDA in support of the PMA included an analysis of 415patients from the RECOVER 1 study and the U.S. Impella registry (cVADRegistry(TM)), as well as an Impella literature review including 692 patientstreated with Impella from 17 clinical studies. A safety analysis reviewed over24,000 Impella treated patients using the FDA medical device reporting (""MDR"")database, which draws from seven years of U.S. experience with Impella.In addition, the Company also provided a benchmark analysis of Impella patientsin the real-world Impella cVAD registry vs. these same patient groups in theAbiomed AB5000/BVS 5000 Registry. The Abiomed BVS 5000 product was the firstventricular assist device (VAD) ever approved by the FDA in 1991 based on 83patient PMA study. In 2003, the AB5000 Ventricle received FDA approval and thisalso included a PMA study with 60 patients.For this approval, the data source for this benchmark analysis was a registry(""AB/BVS Registry"") that contained 2,152 patients that received the AB5000 andBVS 5000 devices, which were originally approved for heart recovery. Theanalysis examined by the FDA used 204 patients that received the AB5000 devicefor the same indications. This analysis demonstrated significantly betteroutcomes with Impella in these patients.The Company believes this is the most comprehensive review ever submitted to theFDA for circulatory support in the cardiogenic shock population. 1.

Stealth BioTherapeutics (Stealth), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing investigational drugs for treating mitochondrial dysfunction, announced promising results from the Phase 1 PREVIEW trial evaluating elamipretide (formerly known as Bendavia) in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction. The results showed elamipretide to be safe and well tolerated with demonstrated improvements in key secondary efficacy measures. The data were presented today at the American College of Cardiology?s 65th Annual Scientific Session (ACC.16) in Chicago during the Novel Therapies in Heart Failure moderated poster session, South Hall A1, from 12:30-1:45 PM CT. Heart failure affects approximately six million people in the U.S. and continues to be the leading cause of hospitalization, despite available therapies. ?The heart requires a significant amount of energy to both contract and relax, and targeting the mitochondrial dysfunction affecting the heart?s energy supply in this population is a new approach to treating the disease,? said Melissa Daubert, M.D., Duke University Health System and the trial?s primary investigator for echocardiography. ?Based on the improvement in heart function seen after just one high-dose treatment, we are very excited to explore the benefits of elamipretide after repeated dosing.? PREVIEW was a randomized, double-blind, ascending dose, placebo-controlled study. Thirty-six patients with ejection fraction less than or equal to 35 percent and stable symptoms of New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II-III heart failure were randomized to a single four-hour infusion of elamipretide in three ascending, weight-adjusted doses (0.005, 0.05 or 0.25 mg/kg/hr) or saline. The primary endpoints were the safety and tolerability of elamipretide. Secondary endpoints were improvement in cardiac function measured by echocardiography. The study demonstrated elamipretide significantly reduced left ventricular volume, or the amount of blood remaining in the left ventricle following a heartbeat, at the end of the four-hour infusion in patients in the highest-dose group. In other long-term studies of patients with heart failure, this reduction in volume has been associated with better outcomes. Trends toward improvement in other echocardiography parameters were also seen in the highest-dose group. The two lower doses showed no significant improvement compared with placebo. Elamipretide was also well tolerated with no serious adverse events in any treatment group; blood pressure and heart rate remained stable in all patients. ?The promising findings in the PREVIEW trial support our ongoing development of elamipretide for heart failure patients with significant unmet treatment needs,? said Chief Executive Officer Reenie McCarthy. ?These findings compel us to study this investigational drug in additional heart failure trials in the coming months for patients with either reduced or preserved ejection fraction, including a study for patients hospitalized due to worsening heart failure. These trials will help further our understanding of elamipretide?s potential to treat the failing heart.?

Human studies have mainly involved short-term assessment, including potential toxicity. Reports describing adverse effects of D-ribose with prolonged ingestion have been lacking. Therefore, this study assessed the toxicity of extended consumption of D-ribose in healthy adults. Nineteen subjects ingested 20 grams/Day (10 grams, twice a Day) of ribose with serial measurements of biochemical and hematological parameters at Days 0, 7, and 14. No significant toxic changes over the 14-day assessment period occurred in complete blood count, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyltransferase, alanine amiotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase. However, D-ribose did produce an asymptomatic, mild hypoglycemia of short duration. Uric acid levels increased at Day 7, but decreased to baseline values by Day 14. D-ribose consumption for 14 days appears not to produce significant toxic changes in both hematological and biochemical parameters in healthy human volunteers. Background D-ribose, a naturally occurring pentose carbohydrate, has shown benefits with negligible adverse effects. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated the recovery benefits in depressed high-energy phosphates with D-ribose as well as functional improvements in the myocardium following ischemia and in isolated skeletal muscle [1?4]. Clinically, congestive heart failure patients have experienced improvements in their diastolic dysfunction, ventilatory efficiency, a better quality of life, and improved physical function activities when taking oral D-ribose [5?7]. The benefits in sports medicine have not been as obvious. When athletes were subjected to repetitive, high intensity exercise, Hellsten, et al. [8] reported that D-ribose provided a recovery benefit in depressed muscular high-energy phosphates in athletes subjected to repetitive, high intensity exercise. Others have also reported the benefits of D-ribose [9?13]. However, some studies did not find a beneficial role of D-ribose in sports medicine. The inconsistent results found in these studies could primarily be due to differences in study design [14?19]. Even so, ribose continues to attract the interest of athletes. Safety of supplements is important and changes in serum biochemical and/or hematological markers could provide an early indication of cellular toxicity. Published studies on D-ribose have mainly centered on acute, short-term investigations, ranging from hours to a few days [2, 4, 8, 9, 11, 20]. This study was designed to evaluate biochemical and hematological parameters in healthy adults who consumed D-ribose for 14 days. Methods We investigated the potential toxicity in hematological and biochemical markers during a 14-day supplementation of oral D-ribose. St. Cloud State University's Institutional Review Board approved this study and informed, written consent was obtained from each subject prior to participation. Twenty-one healthy, non-diabetic, adult subjects (19?25 years of age) were initially enrolled; however, only 19 subjects (12 males, 7 females) completed the study. Each subject maintained their daily diet and routine exercise habits from interviews. Twenty grams of D-ribose, mixed in water, was consumed in two equally divided doses at breakfast and dinner mealtimes each day. Venous blood samples were drawn from an antecubital vein and assessed for hematological and biochemical laboratory parameters at baseline and at Days 7 and 14 while on D-ribose. Each blood sample was collected at an early time period each day in a fasted state. The blood samples were collected in the AM, using a Becton Dickinson Vacutainer (Becton Dickinson, Inc., Franklin Lakes, NJ) coated with lithium heparin. All samples were collected at room temperature (23?C), and each tube was initially frozen before undergoing subsequent duplicate analyses. Measured parameters included: complete blood count (CBC, including hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), white blood count (WBC), platelet counts (Plts), albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), uric acid, and glucose levels. Complete blood counts were analyzed using a Coulter Counter. Plasma samples were analyzed for albumin (Johnson & Johnson Vitros II), glucose (YSI 2300 Stat Analyzer), ALKP (Johnson & Johnson Vitros II), GGT (Johnson & Johnson Vitros II), ALT (Johnson & Johnson Vitros II), AST (Johnson & Johnson Vitros II), and uric acid (Uric Acid Kit, Sigma Chemicals) levels. Measured parameters, including duplicate assessments, were analyzed by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Independent variables, such as gender, were also statistically analyzed by ANOVA. An accepted alpha level of significance was 0.05. Analyses (mean ? SD) were performed with MINITAB 12.1 (Minitab Incorporated, PA). Results There were no adverse physical symptoms in the 19 subjects completing the study. There were no statistically significant differences from baseline to the Day 7 and 14 evaluations in all subjects for CBC parameters: Hgb, Day 7(p < 0.44), Day 14 (p < 0.31); Hct, Day 7 (p < 0.3), Day 14 (p < 0.41); WBC, Day 7 (p < 0.30), Day 14 (p < 0.44); Plts, Day 7 (p < 0.25), Day 14 (p < 0.40) (Table 1). Further, there were no significant differences between genders in measured CBC parameters. However, there was a slight decrease in WBC levels in all subjects with a greater decrease in females at Day 14. Conclusion In summary, 20 grams of oral D-ribose/day for 14-days in healthy subjects did not elicit significant adverse hematological or biochemical abnormalities. However, a mild state of hypoglycemia and hyperuricemia can be observed after oral consumption. http://jissn.biomedcentral.com/artic...1550-2783-5-13",

No Comments In a study appearing in the June 21 issue of JAMA , Peter Ganz, M.D., of the University of California-San Francisco, and colleagues conducted a study to develop and validate a score to predict risk of cardiovascular outcomes among patients with coronary heart disease using analysis of circulating proteins. Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of death and illness. Precise stratification of cardiovascular risk in patients with CHD is needed to inform treatment decisions. This study included participants with stable CHD. For the derivation cohort (Heart and Soul study), outpatients from San Francisco were enrolled from 2000 through 2002 and followed up through November 2011. For the validation cohort (HUNT3, a Norwegian population-based study), participants were enrolled from 2006 through 2008 and followed up through April 2012. A protein risk score was derived and validated for 4-year probability of heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and all-cause death; 1,130 proteins were measured in plasma samples. The risk score was compared with variables (such as total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking status) from the Framingham secondary event risk model, refit to the cohorts in this study. From the derivation cohort, 938 samples were analyzed; from the validation cohort, 971 samples were analyzed. The researchers identified 9 proteins associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and developed a risk score with these proteins that performed better than the refit Framingham secondary event risk score in predicting cardiovascular events, but still provided only modest discriminative accuracy. ""Further research is needed to assess whether the score is more accurate in a lower-risk population,"" the authors write.

However, there remain many gaps in detecting and treating NCDs in African health systems, and little is known about how NCDs are being managed among PLHIV. Developing integrated chronic care models that effectively prevent and treat NCDs among PLHIV requires an understanding of the current patterns of care delivery and the major barriers and facilitators to health care. We present a systematic review protocol to synthesize studies of healthcare delivery for an important subset of NCDs, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (CMDs), among African PLHIV. Methods/design We plan to search electronic databases and reference lists of relevant studies published in African settings from January 2003 to the present. Studies will be considered if they address one or both of our major objectives and focus on health care for one or more of six interrelated CMDs (ischemic heart disease, stroke, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) in PLHIV. Our first objective will be to estimate proportions of CMD patients along the ?cascade of care??i.e., screened, diagnosed, aware of the diagnosis, initiated on treatment, adherent to treatment, and with controlled disease. Our second objective will be to identify unique barriers and facilitators to health care faced by PLHIV in African countries. For studies deemed eligible for inclusion, we will assess study quality and risk of bias using previously published criteria. We will extract study data using standardized instruments. We will meta-analyze quantitative data at each level of the cascade of care for each CMD (first objective). We will use meta-synthesis techniques to understand and integrate qualitative data on health-related behaviors (second objective). Discussion CMDs and other NCDs are becoming major health concerns for African PLHIV. The results of our review will inform the development of research into chronic care models that integrate care for HIV/AIDS and CMDs among PLHIV. Our findings will be highly relevant to health policymakers, administrators, and practitioners in African settings. Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42015029375 Keywords HIV/AIDS Non-communicable diseases Cardiovascular disease Diabetes Delivery of health care Access to health care Screening Diagnosis Medication adherence Africa Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi: 10. 1186/ s13643-016-0241-5 ) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. Background The rollout of antiretroviral drug therapy (ART) over the past decade has reduced morbidity and mortality and produced large gains in life expectancy for people living with HIV (PLHIV) in African countries [ 1 ]. At the same time, the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the region continues to increase, due in part to demographic changes and in part to increased exposure to ?Western? dietary patterns and lifestyle-related risk factors such as tobacco smoking and obesity [ 2 , 3 ]. Consequently, NCDs are increasingly becoming a focus of public health efforts for African PLHIV [ 4 ]. Among the major NCDs, chronic cardiovascular conditions such as ischemic heart disease, stroke, and heart failure appear to occur at higher rates among PLHIV as compared with the general population. This excess risk has been attributed to several factors, including inflammatory effects of the HIV virus, side effects of particular ART regimens, and an increased prevalence of intermediary cardiovascular and metabolic conditions like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia [ 5 ]. This specific rise in cardiovascular risk in African PLHIV threatens to reverse or at least attenuate the health impact of ART rollout in the region [ 6 ]. The challenges to delivering health care for NCDs like cardiovascular disease in African countries have been extensively documented [ 7 ]. With the exception of HIV/AIDS, most health systems remain geared towards episodic care of acute conditions rather than longitudinal care of chronic diseases [ 8 ]. Studies have recently demonstrated major gaps in detecting, treating, and controlling NCDs in African settings [ 9 , 10 ]. At the same time, PLHIV?who are considered a priority group for global health systems?have not been the primary focus of this sort of research. Nor has the management of comorbid NCDs in PLHIV been a high priority for public health programs. So while much continues to be written about the steady progress on delivering ART, it is much less clear how well (or how poorly) NCDs are being managed in this group [ 11 ]. Effectively managing NCDs in African PLHIV will require the development, evaluation, and promulgation of chronic care models. These models should be culturally appropriate, feasible within resource-constrained health systems, and responsive to the local burden of disease [ 12 ]. Developing innovative care models depends greatly on how and where PLHIV use health services, both for their HIV and for other health concerns. How care is delivered, and the possibilities for integrating care, varies from country to country and even within countries [ 13 ]. On the one hand, routine HIV care could be offered alongside NCD care in general primary care settings [ 14 ]. On the other hand, specialized HIV clinics could be strengthened and providers trained to manage NCDs more effectively [ 15 ]. Unfortunately, aside from case studies, there is little evidence on what model or models of care could most effectively integrate the management of HIV and NCDs for PLHIV. Even less clear is the role of other recent innovations?such as mobile screening units, nurse?and community health worker-led care and mobile health technologies (mHealth)?in supporting these care delivery models [ 16 ? 18 ]. The main challenge to improving NCD care in these settings is to enable PLHIV, who have a chronic, life-threatening condition, to embrace the additional complex demands of long-term primary and secondary prevention of NCDs [ 19 ]. Chronic care interventions seek to promote behavior change among patients and, to a lesser extent, providers [ 20 ]. An essential first step in developing and improving models of NCD care among African PLHIV is to describe current patterns of NCD care delivery in these settings. Such an assessment should quantify rates of detection, treatment, and control of NCDs in PLHIV. It should also explore the barriers and facilitators that influence how PLHIV seek and receive NCD care. The knowledge gained from this sort research is a critical input to the process of designing interventions that support behavior change to increase awareness, retention in care, mediation adherence, and ultimately self-management skills [ 21 ]. In this protocol, we outline a systematic review process that assesses patterns of NCD care delivery among PLHIV across African settings, focusing on a specific cluster of NCDs we term ?cardiovascular and metabolic diseases? (CMDs). The cardiovascular conditions of interest are ischemic heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and hypertension, and the related metabolic conditions of interest are diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. The rationale for focusing on healthcare delivery within this cluster of conditions is threefold. First, CMDs arise from a common set of risk factors and are part of a common pathophysiological process that usually results in death from acute heart attack, stroke, or decompensated heart failure. Second, primary and secondary management of CMDs incorporate similar medications, diagnostics, and referral pathways. Third, each CMD has been documented to occur at increased rates among PLHIV. We focus on diseases rather than primordial risk factors such as obesity and tobacco smoking because the former are managed within the healthcare system and primarily through the use of evidence-based drug therapies. The objective of this systematic review is to synthesize the literature on the delivery of care for CMD among PLHIV in African countries. Specifically, we will assess rates of diagnosis, treatment, and control of CMD and identify the distinctive health system barriers and facilitators to preventing and managing CMD in this group. Methods/design This protocol has been registered with the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews ( http:// www. crd. york. ac. uk/ PROSPERO ), registration number CRD42015029375). Where applicable, we have adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) checklist, which is provided as an additional file (see Additional file 1 ) [ 22 ]. Patients, objectives, and conceptual models The aim of this review is to paint a comprehensive picture of the state of healthcare delivery for CMD both from a ?primary prevention? perspective?i.e., reducing risk of developing ischemic heart disease, stroke, and heart failure by managing blood pressure, glucose, and lipids?and from a ?secondary prevention? perspective?i.e., reducing the risk of recurrent, worsening, and fatal cardiovascular disease. Again, this review seeks to understand CMD care within the specific context of health services for PLHIV in the African continent, as this is where the vast majority of PLHIV live. The rationale for restricting our analysis to this region is that African health systems are typically much more resource-limited, and the prevalence (clinical burden) of HIV is much higher than other regions of the world. Our first objective is to characterize the so-called cascade of care for CMDs. The concept of the cascade of care has been widely used in the field of HIV/AIDS to assess gaps in delivery of ART [ 11 ]. Others have applied the concept to hypertension care [ 9 ]. An example of a commonly used three-tiered cascade for hypertension is provided in Fig. 1a . In a clinical context, the first step to addressing CMD is to identify patients at risk, screen and diagnose them appropriately, and make them aware of their diagnosis. The second step is to initiate pharmacologic therapy for specific CMDs that have been diagnosed. The third step is to support medication adherence and disease control, e.g., controlling hypertension by keeping blood pressure within the therapeutic range. We expect that quantitative clinical/epidemiological studies will provide the best scientific evidence to depict this cascade of care. Hence, the outcomes of interest within the first objective are the proportions of PLHIV classified at various levels in the cascade of care for each CMD. Fig. 1 Conceptual frameworks for this systematic review. a A stylized cascade of care for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Adapted from Chow and colleagues [ 9 ]. b The social-ecological model applied to healthcare-seeking behaviors. Adapted from Weiner and colleagues [ 23 ] Our second objective is to identify key barriers and facilitators to the delivery of health care for CMD. Barriers and facilitators can occur both on the patient (?demand?) side and on the provider and health system (?supply?) side. According to social-ecological theory and multilevel theory [ 23 ], barriers and facilitators?and potential interventions?occur at multiple levels, ranging from the intrapersonal to the societal (Fig. 1b ). We expect that qualitative studies will provide the best scientific evidence to identify these health-related behaviors, though we will consider including quantitative studies that incorporate closed-ended questions on barriers and facilitators that can be numerically analyzed. Hence, the outcomes of interest within the second objective are the key concepts and qualitative findings from studies of health-seeking behavior related to CMD in African PLHIV. Eligibility criteria We will review all studies that provide data on the aforementioned outcomes related to CMDs in studies involving PLHIV in African healthcare settings. Because this review seeks to build evidence for chronic care interventions, we will focus on studies of longitudinal outpatient care rather than acute inpatient care. For the first objective, we will consider studies that quantify one or more of the following proportions: diagnosed, aware of disease, initiated on treatment, adherent to medication, and with controlled disease, e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol, or glucose. (The ischemic heart disease, stroke, and heart failure analyses will not include the disease control outcome, since for these conditions it is multifactorial and depends on the presence or absence of other comorbidities.) We will include studies that employ one of the following designs: cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, and retrospective or prospective cohort studies. We will also consider experimental studies if they report on our outcomes of interest (either before or after the intervention); however, CMD intervention effectiveness is outside the scope of this review. For the second objective, we will consider studies that ascertain barriers and facilitators to care through interviews, focus groups, or surveys of patients or healthcare providers. These barriers and facilitators may include health behaviors and attitudes or interpersonal, organizational, or social factors (Fig. 1b ). We will include both ethnographic studies and structured questionnaires of patients and providers, as these methods are the most appropriate for eliciting health-related behaviors. We will exclude all studies conducted in settings outside the African continent as well as those conducted among children (individuals less than 15 years of age) and pregnant women. Multi-site studies will only be included if African data can be disaggregated. We will also exclude studies published in languages other than English or Afrikaans. Conference abstracts will only be considered if they meet the eligibility criteria and provide data of sufficient quality. We will exclude abstracts or manuscripts that present duplicate data, and we will use only the most recent manuscript. Importantly, we will limit our search to reports from January 1, 2003 to the present, because 2003 is widely regarded as the advent of widespread ART across Africa following from large-scale programs such as the World Health Organization?s ?three by five? initiative and the United States President?s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Finally, we will exclude case reports, case series, editorials, and commentaries. We will temporarily retain narrative reviews or relevant systematic reviews in order to check their reference lists, but we will exclude them from the analysis. Search strategy Our search strategy will employ four sets of terms: (1) terms identifying studies of one or more of the six CMDs (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and heart failure); (2) terms identifying studies of HIV/AIDS; (3) terms identifying studies of health service delivery; and (4) filters for African countries, languages, and publication dates. We obtained the filter for African countries from a prior study of techniques for filtering clinical research conducted in African settings [ 24 ]. Table 1 details our search strategy for PubMed, which will be adapted to Embase and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. We will also use more general terms to hand-search the African Index Medicus ( http:// indexmedicus. afro. who. int/ ) database. We will contact experts in the field of HIV/AIDS and NCDs to identify key publications and review our preliminary list of included studies. Finally, we will hand-search reference lists of all included articles.

I'm robo-Suzie and today I'll talk to you about Treatments For Heart Failure. Also don't forget to subscribe for more tips in the future! But back to our topic. Our heart is the center of our whole being. Without this, we will cease to function and exist. This is why there is every need to find treatment for heart failure. Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not function well in supplying blood to the different vital organs of our body. This is commonly mistaken for cardiac arrest. The causes of heart failure include different kind of diseases such as myocardial infarction, hypertension, valvular heart disease and cardiomyopathy. The most common symptoms of this condition are trouble breathing, coughing, swelling of the ankles and reduction in exercise ability. Many call this as a silent killer because it is often undiagnosed. The lack of diagnosis stems from the fact that there is a lack of general definition to make a clear prognosis. Heart failure is surmised as a condition that is crippling and life-threatening. In many countries, an estimated 2 percent of the adult population suffers from this condition. This number significantly increases by the time a person reaches the age of 65. Because of the frequent need to be hospitalized, this is considered as a very costly disease. This condition progresses over time and it may decrease the over all quality of living of the person affected by this condition. The symptoms of heart problems include increase breathing rate (panting). One can also hear Rales in the base of the lungs that can also lead to a disease called pulmonary edema. One might also experience additional heart rhythms and heart murmurs. The first line of defense for this condition is the use of pharmacological treatment for heart failure. This kind of treatment tries to relieve the symptoms and tries to maintain a normal fluid level in the circulatory system. This treatment does not necessarily cure heart failure but it can delay its advancement. The use of ACE inhibitor is also highly recommended because it can significantly reduce blood pressure. A number of people also seek the additional help of some herbal remedies. These herbal remedies have been used for many centuries already and they have garnered their reputation as effective natural treatment for heart failure. The use of an herbal remedy called Hawthorn can help immensely. However, before deciding to take hawthorn, consult first with your doctor so that you are assured that it will not have adverse effects with the high blood pressure medication you are taking. You can also try drinking willow bark tea. Willow bark is an herb that contains a compound called salicin. It can help reduce incidence of blood clotting and can help people with heart diseases.

This stunning development was presented by the Leeds Teaching Hospitals team during a meeting of the American College of Cardiology recently, where the ?stunning? discovery was based on clinical trials from 163 persons with heart failure problems where vitamin D was found in their bloodstream and improved the blood-pumping activity of the heart. The body benefits from vitamin D from the sun as the skin is exposed to sunlight. Other sources of vitamin D for oral supplements are also sourced from plant-based dietary products. The British Heart Foundation, on the other hand, acknowledged the findings of the study but is calling for longer trials to assess the results using oral supplements. Although Vitamin D is considered vital to the body as it provides the essential nutrient for the bones and teeth to stay healthy, as well as other health benefits, however, many people are still considered deficient of this vitamin. Dr. Klaus Witte, a consultant cardiologist involved in the research, said that the average age of people in the study were between 65 to 70 years old and as expected, had low levels of Vitamin D in their bodies even during summer. Dr. Witte said they were baffled by the fact that these people had less amounts of Vitamin D when the skin?s ability to absorb and convert sunlight into the vitamin is more effective at this age. The patients were provided a daily dose of 100 micrograms of Vitamin D in a tablet or sugar pill placebo for a year. The researchers then measured the effects on heart failure ?where the condition is characterized by the heart becoming too weak to pump blood throughout the body. This is determined by what is called the ejection fraction or the amount of blood being pumped out of the heart chambers with each heart beat. An adult considered physically healthy usually generates around 60 to 70 percent but those with heart failure problems usually have at most 25% of the volume pumped out. Surprisingly, those taking the vitamin supplement tablets were found to have seen improvement in their heart ?pumping activity when the ejection fraction jumped to 34%. People should be more conscious about getting their required dose of Vitamin D as it is one of the cheapest and highly available vitamin that can be acquired to stay healthy, Dr. Witte added.

Recent advances in diagnosis include immunochromotographic dipstick assays that selleck products report sensitivity above 90% and may be a better diagnostic tool for use in pregnant women. Pregnant women are 3 times more likely to suffer from severe disease as compared with their nonpregnant counterparts and have a mortality rate from severe malarial infection that approaches 50%. Pregnant women suffer disproportionately from severe anemia as a result of malarial infection. Women with severe anemia are at higher risk for congestive heart failure, fetal demise, and mortality associated with hemorrhage at the time of delivery. Current prevention of malarial disease in pregnancy relies on providing women with insecticide-treated bed nets and intermittent presumptive treatment.Despite the rapid advances in laparoscopic surgery in the past 2 decades, the initial entry still accounts for approximately 40% to 50% of laparoscopic complications and should be considered the most dangerous step of a laparoscopic procedure.1,2 A variety of laparoscopic entry methods have been described. The Hungarian physician J??nos Veres first described the use of his Veres needle to induce pneumothorax in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in 1936.3 Laparoscopic entry using a Veres needle followed by the blind insertion of a sharp trocar remains the most common entry method used by gynecologists. 4,5 Other entry methods include the open technique (Hasson) and direct trocar entry without a preexisting pneumoperitoneum. Unfortunately, the available literature is not clear as to which form of laparoscopic entry is superior in terms of complication risks, and the most common recommendation is for surgeons to use entry methods with which they feel comfortable.6 We would like to share our technique of initial umbilical entry, as well as our experience with alternative site entry in situations where umbilical entry is contraindicated. The basic principle of our umbilical entry technique is to take advantage of the negative intraperitoneal pressure that is generated by pulling on the abdominal fascia. We have been performing this technique for several years with good success, but recently heard of a similar technique that has been performed successfully for decades by Dr. Entinostat Sarath De Alwis in the Cayman Islands. In his honor we have named our technique the modified Alwis method. The original Alwis method is described in Table 1.

However, results of a large randomized trial (SERVE-HF) of ASV in patients with symptomatic heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II to IV) and a low ejection fraction (EF ?45 percent) have raised concern that ASV may be harmful in this population [57]. With a median follow-up of 31 months, patients treated with ASV had an increased risk of both cardiovascular mortality (30 versus 24 percent; HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.09-1.65) and all-cause mortality (35 versus 29 percent; HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06-1.55) compared with the control arm. The primary combined endpoint was negative. Based on these results, ASV should not be initiated in patients with CSA-CSB due to symptomatic heart failure and a low EF.

Abstract Background . Large craniotomy for acute subdural hematoma is sometimes too invasive. We report good outcomes for two cases of neuroendoscopic evacuation of hematoma and contusion by 1 burr hole surgery. Case Presentation. Both patients arrived by ambulance at our hospital with disturbed consciousness after falling. Case was an 81-year-old man who took antiplatelet drugs for brain infarction. Case was a 73-year-old alcoholic woman. CT scanning showed acute subdural hematoma and frontal contusion in both cases. In the acute stage, glycerol was administered to reduce edema; CTs after 48 and 72 hours showed an increase of subdural hematoma and massive contusion of the frontal lobe. Disturbed consciousness steadily deteriorated. The subdural hematoma and contusion were removed as soon as possible by neuroendoscopy under local anesthesia, because neither patient was a good candidate for large craniotomy considering age and past history. 40%~70% of the hematoma was removed, and the consciousness level improved. Conclusion . Neuroendoscopic removal of acute subdural hematoma and contusion has advantages and disadvantages. For patients with underlying medical issues or other risk factors, it is likely to be effective. 1. Introduction Hematoma evacuation by large craniotomy is the standard treatment for acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) with brainstem compression. Craniotomy in general is known to impose a significant burden on patients due to the large amount of bleeding, large skin incision, and long operation time. It also requires general anesthesia, which adds to the burden. Therefore, there are many patients who are considered unsuitable for large craniotomy, because of antiplatelet or anticoagulation drugs, hepatic cirrhosis, or older age. In contrast, neuroendoscopy hematoma evacuation is a minimally invasive procedure, requiring only a 4?cm skin incision and 1 burr hole. It can be performed under local anesthesia and mild sedation. Here we report good outcomes for two patients who underwent neuroendoscopic procedure for hematoma and contusion evacuation. To our knowledge, there are no previous reports of this procedure performed for ASDH with concomitant contusion. 2. Case Presentations 2.1. Case 1 An 81-year-old man presented to our hospital by ambulance with disturbed consciousness after falling. He was taking the antiplatelet drug cilostazol for brain infarction. The admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 13 (E4V4M5). Computed tomography (CT) scanning revealed left ASDH and bilateral frontal contusion with a thickness of 14?mm and a midline shift (MLS) of 8?mm (Figure 1(a) ). Our initial plan was to give conservative treatment. In the acute stage, tranexamic acid (2000?mg) was administered to staunch the bleeding. But CT 24 hours later revealed worsening (thickness 16?mm, MLS 8?mm). Contusion in the left frontal lobe became especially apparent. Glycerol (1600?mL/day) was administered to reduce edema, but the 72-hour CT showed massive contusion of the left frontal lobe and the MLS had increased to 9?mm (Figure 1(b) ). The GCS score deteriorated steadily to E2V2M4. At this point, decision to perform surgery was made. As for the method of surgery, neuroendoscopy under local anesthesia and mild sedation was chosen, since the patient was not a good candidate for large craniotomy considering his age and the use of antiplatelet drug. A 4?cm skin incision was made along the shriveled skin of the left forehead 4?cm above the eyebrow in the hairline, and 1 burr hole was made using a hand drill. We then formed the hole into an earthenware mortar shape and made a cross-dural incision to expose the brain surface. A 10?mm diameter sheath (Neuroport, Olympus Corp.) was inserted into the brain and the contusion was removed first using a rigid scope (0?, 2.7?mm). We then guided the Neuroport to the subdural space and removed the subdural hematoma as completely as possible. Figure 1: (a) Axial plain CT scan at the time of admission shows left acute subdural hematoma and bilateral frontal contusion with thickness of 14?mm and midline shift of 8?mm. There is a bruised area in the right parietal region without bone fracture. (b) Axial plain CT scan 72 hours after admission shows worsened acute subdural hematoma with thickness of 16?mm and midline shift of 9?mm. Massive contusion of the left frontal lobe has occurred. (c) Radiographic frontal view shows the location of the burr hole 4?cm above the left eyebrow. (d) Axial plain CT scan after surgery shows reduced hematoma. Midline shift had improved to 4?mm. There is a small amount of air in the subdural space. Burr hole is covered by bone powders. In total, 40% of the hematoma was removed, and the MLS was improved to 4?mm after the procedure (Figures 1(c) and 1(d) ). Tranexamic acid (250?mg) was administered to prevent postoperative oozing. The consciousness level started to improve right after the operation and eventually improved to E4V3M5 20 days after operation. The patient could eat without assistance by this time. Kampo (goreisan) was prescribed to prevent chronic subdural hematoma. 2.2. Case 2 A 73-year-old woman presented to our hospital by ambulance with disturbed consciousness after drinking alcohol and falling. Her past medical history was diabetes and alcohol abuse. Her admission GCS score was 14 (E4V4M6). CT scanning showed right ASDH and right frontal and temporal contusion with a thickness of 10?mm and an MLS of 6?mm (Figure 2(a) ). Our initial plan was to give conservative treatment. In the acute stage, tranexamic acid (2000?mg) and glycerol were administered, as with Case . But the CT after 48 hours showed edema around the contusion and uncal herniation with anisocoria (Figure 2(b) ). Since the massive contusion in the frontal lobe exerted a mass effect, removal of contusion was considered. Figure 2: (a) Axial plain CT scan at the time of admission shows right acute subdural hematoma and right frontal and temporal contusion with thickness of 10?mm and midline shift of 6?mm. There is a bruised area in the left temporal region without bone fracture. (b) Axial plain CT scan 48 hours after admission showed massive contusion and uncal herniation. The midline shift has worsened to 9?mm. (c) Most hematoma was removed and midline shift was completely resolved. The massive contusion in the right frontal lobe was reduced. The information drain was inserted into the subdural space. (d) Radiographic frontal view shows location of the burr hole 3?cm above the right eyebrow. We removed the subdural hematoma and contusion to the furthest extent possible by neuroendoscopy under local anesthesia and mild sedation, as with Case . We placed a 4?cm incision on the forehead outside of the hairline in order to remove the massive contusion together with the subdural hematoma. Considering cosmetic outcomes, incision was made parallel to the wrinkle lines and 5-0 nylon suture was used for skin closure. In total, 70% of the hematoma was removed, and the MLS improved completely (Figures 2(c) and 2(d) ). Tranexamic acid (250?mg) was administered to prevent postoperative oozing. The consciousness level started to improve right after the operation and eventually improved to E4V4M6 27 days after the operation. The skin incision was hardly noticeable after suture removal. 3. Discussion 3.1. Indications Surgical treatment often considered for ASDH is large craniotomy hematoma evacuation. However, craniotomy in general imposes a significant burden on patients due to the large amount of bleeding, large question mark skin incision, and long operation time under general anesthesia. Therefore, the procedure may be inadvisable for patients with medical conditions such as liver cirrhosis, older age, and the use of antiplatelet/anticoagulation drugs. In contrast, neuroendoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive technique that can be performed under local anesthesia and therefore can be applied to patients who may not endure craniotomy. For example, it is considered suitable for elderly patients with complications such as heart failure. In such cases, reduction of antiedema drugs will become possible after the surgery, thus preventing the exacerbation of heart failure. However, there are few reports of neuroendoscopic surgery on ASDH. Although there are increasing reports on neuroendoscopic removal of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH), removal of ASDH is considered difficult because of its gelatinous nature as opposed to the serous nature of CSDH [ 1 ? 3 ]. Our literature research revealed only one report of neuroendoscopic surgery for pure ASDH. It was a case of ASDH (width 15?mm, MLS 14?mm) of an 84-year-old woman with GCS of E1VTM6 who fell a week before the surgery. Hematoma was removed through 2 perforating burr holes at the front and back of the convexity, using a 0-degree and a 30-degree rigid scope. The operation took 2 hours, and blood loss was 150?mL. The patient was discharged 2 months later without any sequelae [ 4 , 5 ]. We found no reports of neuroendoscopy performed to relieve ASDH with contusion. The probable reason for this is that there are some difficulties with stopping the bleeding from the contusion and oozing from the brain surface via neuroendoscopy. Due to these hemostatic problems, large craniotomy, which allows better hemostatic control, is usually selected for cases that need decompression from the moment of injury. From our experience of two cases presented earlier, we would like to recommend the choice of neuroendoscopic surgery on cases of ASDH that are able to be observed clinically without immediate surgery but are expected to gain better outcomes (e.g., efficiency of rehabilitation) through surgical intracranial pressure reduction. For such cases, we also recommend the wait time, if possible, of about 48 hours before surgery for better hemostatic control. In our cases, it was not our original intent to wait for 48 hours after the traumatic accident. Our initial plan was to give conservative treatment, but since the patients? consciousness level gradually deteriorated, we decided to switch to surgical treatment. As for the method of surgery, neuroendoscopy was chosen because the patients were elderly with multiple complications. During the surgery, we did not experience any difficulty in hemostasis; this is why we considered that 48 hours of wait time may have brought a natural hemostasis and thus resulted in a safer endoscopic surgery. However, it goes without saying that continuous assessment of consciousness and frequent follow-up CT examinations are required during the wait time. Surgical treatment should immediately be applied to patients when deterioration of consciousness is observed. For our cases, we also did a careful checkup of coagulation factors during the wait time because the use of tranexamic acid may slightly increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Endoscopic surgery performed under local anesthesia is much less invasive compared to the traditional surgery, resulting in a faster postoperative recovery. As for our two patients, their conditions improved soon after the operation and both followed a good postoperative course. Thus, we consider that the 48?72 hours of wait time did not affect their clinical outcome. The reason for the increased hospital stay in our cases was that the patients lived alone with no family and therefore took longer time to be transferred to a rehabilitation hospital. Although the hematoma removal was incomplete for both cases, we consider that this was not related to the increased hospital stay. Total removal of hematoma is considered unnecessary if partial removal of hematoma is sufficient enough to alleviate the mass effect because the remaining hematoma gets absorbed naturally. Even in large craniotomy, there are cases when we leave some hematomas untouched, especially ones that are located around the skull base and the bridging vein. There may be some concerns over the removal of contusion, since the contusion is normally reserved in order to improve functional outcomes. However, when a contusion is so massive that it forms an intracerebral hematoma over 30?cc and exerts a mass effect, removal of contusion (=intracerebral hematoma) needs to be considered. For such cases, a simple decompressive surgery may not be sufficient to decrease the intracranial pressure, and thus removal of intracerebral hematoma may be required. As for the method of surgery, we often have no choice but to perform craniotomy for cases of massive contusion in the temporal lobe, because those contusions produce early brainstem compression. On the other hand, for massive contusions in the frontal lobe, we are often able to take a wait-and-see approach, so these are possible candidates for neuroendoscopic surgery. In our case, the patient had an intracerebral hematoma caused by a massive contusion in the right frontal lobe. We planned to control the intracranial pressure by removing the massive intracerebral hematoma together with the subdural hematoma under endoscopic surgery. Last but not least, we would like to point out that although we are currently unable to perform neuroendoscopic surgery at an acute stage due to the difficulty of hemostasis, it may become possible in the future in response to the development of endoscopic hemostatic devices. 3.2. Technical Methodology We make 1 burr hole in the direction of the long axis of the ASDH. We do not make it on the convexity, because that location imposes a limitation for neuroendoscopy. We locate the burr hole in front of the contusion if the patient has massive contusion with ASDH. We can remove both ASDH and the contusion by doing it this way. When we remove the hematoma by neuroendoscopy through the forehead, it is easy to remove the contusion, but it is important to guide the Neuroport to the subdural space in a skillful manner. Firstly, we guide the Neuroport into the subdural space after removing the contusion omnidirectionally. Then, we move the Neuroport to the outside and continuously feed it into the subdural space beyond the contusion. After that, we can advance the Neuroport for about 6?cm. Gradually, we manage to recognize the Sylvian vein. Further aspiration would lead to bleeding, so we suggest not advancing further after recognition of the Sylvian vein. This is technical advice, but deep lying hematoma in the brain can easily be suctioned, since there are very few vessels in the deep matter. However, vessels are rich in the subpial space, and frequent electrocoagulation using suction coagulation device is necessary. In addition, we do not recommend the use of a flexible scope, because its suction effect is somewhat lacking. We recommend using a suction instrument to reduce the hematoma through a rigid scope. A flexible scope can cause impairment of the brain directly. In contrast, we can use the Neuroport attached to the rigid scope as the brain retractor. For safety, we recommend the placement of an information drain into the subdural space in order to check the postoperative bleeding, because we cannot stop bleeding completely insomuch as does a large craniotomy. In terms of cosmesis of Case , it would have been better for the incision to be placed in the hairline like Case . However, Case was an exceptional case in which a massive intracerebral hematoma on the right frontal lobe exerted a mass effect on the brain. There was a necessity to make the skin incision on the middle of the forehead in ord...",

Some people have been concerned that patient experience isn?t the most important factor to measure, said coauthor Dr. Ashish K. Jha of the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. ?Medicare has been putting a lot of data out for a long time, but the broad consensus has been it?s very hard for consumers to use this info,? Jha told Reuters Health by phone. ?CMS responded by giving out star ratings that consumers can understand easily.? The five-star rating system is based on patients? answers to 27 questions about a recent hospital stay. Questions cover communication with nurses and doctors, the responsiveness of hospital staff, the hospital's cleanliness and quietness, pain management, communication about medicines, discharge information, and would they recommend the hospital. The survey is administered to a random sample of adult patients between 48 hours and six weeks after hospital discharge. (Consumers can compare their local hospitals online at http://1.usa.gov/1Rt7DGW.) For the new study, the researchers compared the CMS patient-experience ratings at more than 3,000 hospitals in October 2015 to data from those hospitals on death or readmission within 30 days of discharge. Patients in the study had been hospitalized for heart attack, pneumonia or heart failure. Of the 3,000 hospitals, 125 had five stars, more than 2,000 had three or four stars, 623 had two stars, and 76 had only one star. Four and five-star hospitals tended to be small rural nonteaching hospitals in the Midwest. Five-star hospitals had the lowest average patient death rate, 9.8 percent over the 30 days following discharge, while four three and two-star hospitals all had just over 10 percent mortality rates and one-star hospitals had an average 11.2 percent mortality rate, as reported in JAMA Internal Medicine. Five-star hospitals also readmitted less than 20 percent of patients over the next month, while other hospitals all readmitted at least that many. The data only included Medicare patients, who are older and may not have the same results as younger patients, and there was not much difference between two, three and four-star hospitals, the authors note. ?If you use the star rating you?re more likely to end up at a high quality hospital,? Jha said. ?But I wouldn?t use only the star rating to choose a hospital.? ?I don?t think these data are enough to by themselves to suggest that (patients) should use the star rating as a single guide to choose an institution,? agreed Dr. Joshua J. Fenton of the University of California, Davis, who was not part of the new study. No large hospitals had five stars, and more than half of the five-star facilities didn?t have an intensive care unit, Fenton told Reuters Health by phone. ?I can say from practicing in a rural hospital for a few years and we did not have an ICU, when we hospitalized someone with pneumonia or congestive heart failure, we would certainly not have kept them there if we thought it was likely there would be a complication,? he said. Smaller rural hospitals ?select? less acute patients, he said. The authors of the new study tried to account for that, but it may still have affected the results.

Mast Therapeutics, Inc. logo. SAN DIEGO , March 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Mast Therapeutics, Inc. (NYSE MKT: MSTX), a biopharmaceutical company developing novel, clinical-stage therapies for sickle cell disease and heart failure, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2015 . ""Last month we announced that we had completed patient enrollment in our Phase 3 study of vepoloxamer in sickle cell crisis, known as the EPIC study. The study was conducted in 14 countries at more than 75 sites and is the largest placebo-controlled study in sickle cell disease ever concluded. It was a monumental effort to finish enrollment as quickly as possible and I commend the clinical investigators, the patients, and their families for this important achievement,"" stated Brian M. Culley , Chief Executive Officer. ""Vepoloxamer remains the most clinically-advanced new drug in development for sickle cell disease and we look forward to seeing the top-line results of the EPIC study in the second quarter of 2016."" ""We also recently announced positive data from a Phase 2a study of AIR001 in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction conducted at Mayo Clinic,"" continued Mr. Culley. ""In this blinded and placebo-controlled study, AIR001 showed a statistically significant improvement in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure during exercise, the pre-specified primary endpoint, and attenuated other hemodynamic derangements of cardiac failure that occur during exercise in HFpEF patients. We look forward to initiation of the next Phase 2 study of AIR001 in the third quarter of this year, a 100-patient multi-center trial to be conducted at the premier clinical centers that make up the Heart Failure Clinical Research Network."" Fourth Quarter 2015 Operating Results The Company's net loss for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $10.2 million , or $0.06 per share (basic and diluted), compared to a net loss of $7.3 million , or $0.05 per share (basic and diluted), for the same period in 2014. Research and development (R&D) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $7.2 million , an increase of $2.3 million , or 45%, compared to $4.9 million for the same period in 2014. The increase was due mainly to increases of $0.9 million in external nonclinical study fees and expenses related primarily to research-related manufacturing costs for vepoloxamer ( $0.4 million ) and nonclinical toxicology studies of vepoloxamer to support a vepoloxamer NDA submission ( $0.4 million ), $0.9 million in external clinical study fees and expenses related primarily to EPIC study costs ( $0.5 million ) and costs for the Phase 2 study of vepoloxamer in heart failure ( $0.4 million ), and $0.4 million in personnel expenses. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $2.5 million , an increase of $0.1 million , or 5%, compared to $2.4 million for the same period in 2014. Year-to-Date Operating Results The Company's net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $39.8 million , or $0.25 per share (basic and diluted), compared to a net loss of $28.7 million , or $0.23 per share (basic and diluted), for the same period in 2014. R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $28.3 million , an increase of $8.9 million , or 45%, compared to $19.4 million for the same period in 2014. The increase was due to increases of $5.1 million in external nonclinical study fees and expenses, $2.9 million in external clinical study fees and expenses, $0.7 million in personnel costs and $0.2 million in share-based compensation expense. The increase in external nonclinical study fees and expenses resulted primarily from research-related manufacturing costs for vepoloxamer ( $2.9 million ), nonclinical toxicology studies of vepoloxamer to support a vepoloxamer NDA submission ( $1.8 million ) and consulting fees for NDA-readiness activities related to vepoloxamer ( $0.4 million ). The increase in external clinical study fees and expenses was related primarily to increases in EPIC study costs ( $3.3 million ) and the Phase 2 study of vepoloxamer in heart failure ( $0.9 million ), offset by decreases in costs for the discontinued Phase 2 study of vepoloxamer in acute limb ischemia ( $0.8 million ) and AIR001 clinical study expenses ( $0.5 million ). The increase in personnel costs resulted primarily from additional regulatory, clinical operations and research-related manufacturing staff hired in 2015. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $11.0 million , an increase of $1.5 million , or 16%, compared to $9.5 million for the same period in 2014. The increase resulted primarily from increases in consulting expenses and personnel costs.

The research is published online by the journal Nature Communications. http://www.medicilon.com/servise1/ Chemistry Services http://www.medicilon.com/servise1/Medicinal-Chemistry.shtml Medicinal Chemistry Services http://www.medicilon.com/servise1/Synthetic-Chemistry.shtml Synthesis Chemistry http://www.medicilon.com/servise1/Process-Development.shtml Process Development Services http://www.medicilon.com/servise1/Analytical-Chemistry.shtml Analytical Chemistry The team, led by Jonathan Davis, an associate professor and biophysicist with The Ohio State University Davis Heart and Lung Research Institute, developed a protein engineering approach by tailoring the heart's ability to respond to calcium, which is the signal for contraction. Using a modified version of troponin C (TnC L48Q), their study showed it can enhance or therapeutically preserve heart function and cardiovascular performance in mice without harmful effects commonly seen with other agents that increase heart muscle contraction. ""Essentially, it's like adjusting a radio dial to tune in the music you want to hear. If you don't adjust the radio, or receptor, the signal just passes by undetected,"" Davis said. ""When we modify, or tune the receptor, it's able to get the right message to tell the heart muscle how hard to contract."" Davis says most heart muscle diseases involve problems with contraction. Many strategies increase the calcium signal to improve heart contraction. However, they do so at the expense of other functions. This can cause negative side effects, such as arrhythmias and cell death, and ultimately increase mortality. The team evaluated TnC L48Q in a common heart pathology - myocardial infarction, or a heart attack. Compared to the infarcted control group, TnC L48Q mice had better heart function and cardiovascular performance. There were also no signs of congestive heart failure or increased mortality, both of which were observed in the control group. When assessing the long-term effects and therapeutic potential of TnC L48Q, the researchers observed steady and significant improvement in heart function, cardiovascular performance, and significantly less detrimental remodeling compared to the control group. This resulted in better survival. ""It's long been presumed that altering the receptor would be ineffective, that it was better to change the calcium signal. We're seeing strong evidence that's not the case. Changing the calcium receptor does have a significant and safer impact,"" said Vikram Shettigar, lead author of the study. The scientists report these results were achieved by replacing only a modest amount of the original TnC receptor through gene therapy. This makes it more likely that this strategy will be a viable and personalized treatment option in the future. Moreover, Davis believes these findings could open the door for new treatments against cardiac diseases. In previous in vitro work, the team has customized several TnC receptors designed to combat various cardiac disorders. The team is also working on engineering other calcium receptors for a variety of diseases, such as high blood pressure and heart arrhythmias. For example, in ongoing animal model studies, Davis said there is early indication that a universal receptor, calmodulin, can also be tuned with no adverse effect. Next, the researchers intend to test engineered TnC receptors in large animal models.",

Men taking the impotence drug were found to have a lower risk of having a heart attack or dying from heart failure than those not on the medication. The lead scientist told the Daily Express the findings are 'incredibly exciting'. Patients taking the male impotence drug were found to have a lower risk of having a heart attack or dying from heart failure than those not on the medication Experts from the Centre for Cardiac Research at the University of Manchester studied 6,000 diabetic patients in Cheshire who had been given Viagra - which works by increasing blood flow - to treat erectile dysfunction. Despite diabetics being prone to heart problems, the study participants did not suffer as many incidents as similar patients not on the drug. Professor Andrew Trafford and his team, funded by the British Heart Foundation, are hoping to show the medication can also help prevent arrhythmias - abnormal heart rhythms. He said: 'Heart failure is a devastating condition which means your heart is not pumping blood around your body as well as it used to. 'It can really impact a person's quality of life and currently the outlook for patients with heart failure is grim - worse than that of some cancers. 'Our studies have shown that drugs normally used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, such as Viagra, actually have a very pronounced effect in slowing the progression of heart failure as well as reducing the likelihood of fatal arrhythmias. He added: 'We have recently established that patients who receive Viagra or similar drugs for erectile dysfunction are also far less likely to then go on and die from a heart attack.'

After all, there?s certainly no shortage of news about the dangers of excess sugar consumption. Just this year sugar has been linked to everything from increased cancer risk to increased risk of heart failure. One of the more surprising studies found sugar contributed to a 50 percent increased risk for death?even when consumed in so-called safe doses. But, if you?re like most Americans, chances are these headlines didn?t stop you from indulging in the sweet treats that are bountiful this time of year?it?s just once a year, right? In light of this reality, we compiled a list of ways you can help your body recover from the 3-5 day sugar rush you just engaged. 1) Keep Eating This may be surprising advice, but it?s true?the worst thing you can do after a sugar binge is skip meals. Studies have found that skipping meals over a long period of time activates BMI-increasing genes?not good. After a few irresponsible days, your sugar stores are high. Dramatically cutting calories by skipping meals will only send your body into survival mode, causing it to hold on to these stores, rather than letting them go. In the days following a sugar binge, you?re best approach is to eat 4-5 small, low-fat meals a day, so that you?re metabolism stays revved up. 2) Choose Foods High in Fiber Try eating high-fiber foods such as kale, leafy green salads or broccoli. These low-calorie foods will help move things along in your digestive tract while keeping you full and satisfied. The American Heart Association recommends adding 14 or more grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories consumed. 3) Drink More Water With every sugar binge comes excess water retention, bloating and general soreness. Post-binge day, shoot for at least 76-80 ounces of water. 4) Increase Your Intake of 3 Key Sugar-Regulating Nutrients There are three supplements that are especially effective when it comes to helping your body process sugar. In the days following a sugar binge, be sure to increase your intake of one (or all) of these: Cinnamon Extract: Cinnamon can dramatically influence how the body processes sugar. The spice has been clinically proven to support healthy glucose metabolism and blood sugar levels. Shoot for 250-500 mg a day for best results. Chromium: Chromium helps the body regulate and reduce blood sugar levels. You can find this in supplement form, but another option is to add a chromium-rich Brewer?s Yeast to your diet. Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA): While you can find ALA in foods like spinach and broccoli, its ?damage control? effects require doses that are not likely to be found in foods. To boost insulin sensitivity and help the body better cope with a sugar rush, shoot for 200 mg a day. 5) Take a 45 Minute Walk sugar You can choose to take a long 45 minute walk, or three 15-minute power walks, but this post-sugar binge effort is a must. Walking will not only get your blood flowing?which is very cleansing?, it will boost your metabolism, burn more calories and support the health of your pancreas. 6) QUIT THE SUGAR! Perhaps the most critical rule when attempting to recover from a sugar binge is to stop eating sugar. While this sounds simple enough, many will find it unthinkably difficult to adhere to this post-sugar binge rule. Why? Because sugar is incredibly addictive. In fact, one recent study found the sweet white stuff to be even more addicting than cigarettes and heroine. The best approach is to just quit cold turkey.",

Pakistani authorities said Kirpal Singh died due to heart failure ?On Kirpal Singh, our acting high commissioner in Islamabad has been instructed to seek a meeting at the highest possible level in the Pakistan foreign office this forenoon to seek early transportation of the mortal remains,? external affairs ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said on Wednesday. ?He will also ask for official information on cause of death, postmortem report etc,? he added. Kirpal Singh, 54, died at a hospital in Pakistan?s Kot Lakhpat Jail. He was alleged to have been involved in a bombing at Faisalabad Railway Station in 1991 and sentenced to death for spying and terrorism in Pakistan. He was transferred to a hospital on Monday after suddenly his health deteriorated, jail officials said. Pakistani authorities said Kirpal Singh died due to heart failure. In 2013, an Indian death row convict Sarabjit Singh was attacked by two other inmates at the Kot Lakhpat Jail. He later succumbed to his wounds at the hospital. On Tuesday, a sister of Kirpal Singh protested at the Attari-Wagah integrated checkpost on the India-Pakistan border over his death. ?My brother Kirpal has been murdered just like Sarabjit was earlier. The Pakistani jail authorities are responsible for his death,? Jagir Kaur said during the protest. She was accompanied by many other protestors, among them Dalbir Kaur, the elder sister of Sarabjit Singh. The family demanded that Kirpal Singh?s body be handed over to them for cremation at his native village in Punjab?s Gurdaspur district. Related News",

I do hard, heavy, physical work. I work over nights, 9P - 5:30A. Up and down ladders, getting stuff out of overheads, pushing, pulling, and dragging pallets of freight around. Stupid bitch Samantha thinks I have a hang nail or a paper cut. My father died when he was 39 years old of a massive heart attack and a stroke, I was 15 at the time. He was adopted and none of us know anything about his genetic background. I'm the first of 6, I do know we are predisposed to genetically inherited diseases. Cancer and kidney disease has affected my Mother and siblings. But theses 2 morons say they're medically qualified to 2nd guess the Dr.'s I've seen. These morons need to know we're not lab rats or textbooks, we're individuals. Things will manifest differently from one person to another. Since these 2 morons don't think I need the evaluation and treatment recommendations the Dr. Did, I'm going to have the Dr. release me to go back to work. If something happens to me after I go back to work, this will be on them. I let the Company know I was denied, if I get hurt at work, they'll be liable. But the bright spot in this, I don't have to continue to keep STD and LTD coverage. They're done, they won't see anymore of my money, not another dime. To all that have been scammed and ripped off by Aetna, drop them. You can make changes in your coverage once in a 12 month period. And don't go Humana, Aetna bought them last year. They complain they're losing money, how? They pay zero claims!""",

Previous studies have focused on the impacts of cholesterol and blood pressure-lowering drugs for people with established cardiovascular or renal disease, diabetes, other high risk conditions or in those with markedly elevated cholesterol or blood pressure levels. Current guidelines recommend the use of these drugs mainly in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease. The trial, called HOPE-3, is the first to assess outcomes of preventative treatment with cholesterol and blood pressure-lowering drugs in a large, globally diverse population at intermediate risk for developing cardiovascular disease. Statins--alone or in combination with blood pressure-lowering drugs--were found to be superior to placebo for both the study's first co-primary endpoint, a composite of cardiovascular deaths, heart attacks and strokes, and its second co-primary endpoint, a composite of those events plus heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest and revascularization procedures, such as bypass surgery or angioplasty. For these endpoints, blood pressure drugs were found to improve outcomes compared with placebo only in patients with elevated blood pressure; these drugs were associated with no improvements in patients without elevated blood pressure, and there was a trend toward worse outcomes in those with relatively low blood pressure. ""The implications for practice are huge--I think we certainly should consider using statins much more widely than we have used them thus far,"" said Salim Yusuf, M.B.B.S., D.Phil., professor of medicine at McMaster University, executive director of the Population Health Research Institute of McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences and a senior member of the research team. ""In particular for patients with hypertension, our study suggests you can essentially double the benefit of lowering blood pressure in hypertensives if you also lower cholesterol simultaneously."" The trial included 12,705 people in 21 countries on six continents. All participants had at least one known cardiovascular risk factor, such as smoking, an elevated waist-to-hip ratio or a family history of heart disease, but none had been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. The trial was designed to focus on preventing cardiovascular disease before it starts. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a cholesterol-lowering drug--10 milligrams of rosuvastatin--or a placebo pill daily and either a blood pressure lowering drug--a combination pill with 16 milligrams of candesartan and 12.5 milligrams of hydrocholothiazide--or a placebo pill daily. Through this randomization, patients were sorted evenly into four categories: those receiving both a cholesterol-lowering drug and a blood pressure-lowering drug, those receiving only a cholesterol-lowering drug, those receiving only a blood pressure-lowering drug and those receiving only placebo pills. Outcomes were tracked for a median of 5.6 years. Cardiovascular death, heart attack or stroke occurred in 3.5 percent of patients receiving both drugs and in 5 percent of patients receiving only placebo. The relative risk reduction in those taking both drugs was 30 percent overall, 40 percent in those with elevated blood pressure and 20 percent in those without elevated blood pressure. The results for the study's second co-primary endpoint were identical for this analysis. A separate analysis focusing on the use of statins alone showed 3.7 percent of participants who took statins experienced the first co-primary endpoint, a composite of cardiovascular deaths, heart attacks and strokes, a significant reduction compared with 4.8 percent among patients taking a placebo. Among patients taking statins, 4.4 percent experienced the second co-primary endpoint, a composite of the events in the first co-primary endpoint plus heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest and revascularization procedures, such as bypass surgery or angioplasty, a significant reduction compared with 5.7 percent among patients taking a placebo. Patients taking statins experienced, on average, a drop in low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol of 39.6 mg/dL, about 25 percent, after 12 months. The benefits of statins were similar across all ethnic groups and across all baseline LDL levels, suggesting that a person's starting cholesterol levels are not important in determining whether the person will benefit from statins. These findings suggest that many people who have average cholesterol and blood pressure levels and are at average risk for heart disease--and not just those with extremely high cholesterol or blood pressure levels--can benefit from statins. The treatment was also remarkably safe; although some patients reported muscle weakness or pain, these effects were generally alleviated by stopping the statins or reducing the dose. ""The take-home message is that statins are safe and effective, and that because benefits were similar irrespective of pretreatment cholesterol levels or levels of inflammatory markers, no baseline blood tests are required to identify the patients who will derive benefits from this treatment,"" said Jackie Bosch, Ph.D., associate professor of rehabilitation science at McMaster University and director of the prevention Program at the Population Health Research Institute, who led the report focused on rosuvastatin. ""Our results were remarkably consistent across all subgroups."" An analysis focusing on the use of blood pressure lowering drugs alone revealed no significant improvements overall in those receiving the drugs compared with those receiving a placebo. However, in a pre-specified analysis, when the patients were stratified into thirds by baseline systolic blood pressure, an analysis of subgroups with the highest, middle and lowest starting systolic blood pressure revealed significant differences. Among the one-third of participants with the highest blood pressure, a starting systolic blood pressure above 143.5 mm Hg, 4.8 percent experienced the first co-primary endpoint and 5.7 percent experienced the second co-primary endpoint, significantly lower than 6.5 and 7.5 percent, respectively, among patients taking placebo. ""Overall in this population the blood pressure lowering drugs had no clear benefit, but in those with higher blood pressure before therapy--over 143.5 mm Hg--the treatment was effective. However, there was no benefit in those with lower blood pressure and even a tendency towards harm in those in the lowest third of the blood pressure distribution,"" said Eva Lonn, M.D., FACC, a cardiologist and professor of cardiology at McMaster University and senior scientist at the Population Health Research Institute, who led the report focused on blood pressure lowering medications. ""These data suggest blood pressure-lowering medications are appropriate for people with hypertension but that people with lower blood pressure who have no other reasons to use blood pressure reducing drugs should avoid taking these drugs."" Treating high blood pressure can be a time-consuming and intensive process involving multiple visits to the doctor's office for blood tests to help adjust dosing. This itself has been a significant impediment to reducing risk in people with hypertension because many patients find it inconvenient to make multiple visits or use multiple drugs, especially at full doses, which carries a higher risk of side-effects. Yusuf said the study findings point to the value of a more simplified approach, which places more emphasis on statins in the general population and adds low doses of combination blood pressure medications to the statins in patients with mild hypertension. In this study, combination therapy reduced risk among people with elevated blood pressure by 40 percent safely, without dose titration or the need for frequent blood tests. ""Most of the hypertension guidelines right now focus on what agents to use and what blood pressure to aim for, and there has been very little emphasis on the importance of statins in treating patients with hypertension,"" Yusuf said. ""Our approach, which used a combination of moderate doses of two blood pressure lowering-drugs plus a statin, appears to produce the biggest 'bang,' in terms of reducing events, with few side effects."" One limitation of the study is that, while it tracked patients for more than five years--a long period of time compared to most clinical trials--it can take many more years or even decades to show the full improvements in outcomes from primary disease prevention interventions. It is possible that extending the study for a longer period of time may have revealed larger benefits.",

Essentially, Tyrek Coger had an enlarged heart in response to a heart condition that caused the left ventricle to work harder than it should. Per mayoclinic.org, as the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and the size of the chamber can also increase to an unsafe size. In a press conference Friday morning, Brad Underwood said that this was ?the hardest couple of days I?ve ever experienced in my coaching life.? Athletic director Mike Holder, addressing the tragedy at the conference added that,? I can?t get my mind around [the tragedies that have happened to OSU]. Especially our basketball programs. Two plane crashes. Now we have this.? According to authorities, Tyrek Coger did not appear to struggle during the conditioning drill, which included running stairs. Coger reportedly sat down at the top of the stairs upon completion of the workout, when players and coaches noticed something was wrong. Trainers called 911 and firefighters arrived at the stadium in less than 5 minutes to rush Coger to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 6:23 PM. University officials said they went through an extensive series of health tests, which did not give any indication that Tyrek Coger suffered from any health ailments.

Mrs Reagan will be buried at the library alongside her husband, who died on June 5, 2004. The 94-year-old former First Lady passed away in Bel Air, California , on Sunday after suffering congestive heart failure. Instead of flowers, Mrs Reagan asked that contributions be made to the library. Starting as an actress in the 1940s and 1950s, she married Ronald Reagan - then president of the Screen Actors Guild - in 1952. RELATED ARTICLES Share Mrs Reagan was an influential First Lady during her husband's presidency from 1981 to 1989. Notably she spearheaded the 'Just Say No' to campaign against drugs, speaking at schools and appearing on TV shows such as Dynasty and Diff'rent Strokes to promote the cause. 'Drugs take away the dream from every child's heart and replace it with a nightmare, and it's time we in America stand up and replace those dreams,' she said in a speech which led to 12,000 Just Say No clubs being set up across the country and a Just Say No Week implemented by Congress.

Ronald Reagan died on June 5, 2004, after a 10-year battle with Alzheimer's disease. In recent years, Nancy struggled with her health after falling at home and breaking three ribs in 2012, not long after breaking her pelvis at home in 2008. Despite her own health setbacks, however, Mrs Reagan remained active in politics, particularly in relation to stem-cell research. On Sunday, President Obama, Bill Clinton, and George W Bush led tribes to the former First Lady. It is not yet been revealed whether they will attend the funeral. Friends, relatives and associates along with celebrities took to Twitter to express their sadness over her death. Despite her own health setbacks Mrs Reagan remained active in politics, particularly in stem-cell research Michael Reagan, her stepson, tweeted: 'She is once again with the man she loved', while former President George W Bush also spoke about her love for her husband in a statement released on behalf of himself and his wife. It read: 'Laura and I are saddened by the loss of former First Lady Nancy Reagan. Mrs Reagan was fiercely loyal to her beloved husband, and that devotion was matched only by her devotion to our country. 'Her influence on the White House was complete and lasting. During her time as first lady and since, she raised awareness about drug abuse and breast cancer. 'When we moved into the White House, we benefited from her work to make those historic rooms beautiful. 'Laura and I are grateful for the life of Nancy Reagan, and we send our condolences to the entire Reagan family.'

Reagan played the main character's sister Mariette, who is engaged to a class-lusting physician (played by Warner Anderson). Nancy Reagan pictured in her first big screen role as the sister of a wealthy doctor played by Glenn Ford in The Doctor And The Girl EAST SIDE, WEST SIDE (1950) In this Mervyn LeRoy-directed melodrama about a married couple torn apart by the husband's infidelities, Reagan played Helen Lee, a socialite and best friend to Barbara Stanwyck's wronged wife. James Mason played Stanwyck's philandering husband, one of whose consorts was Ava Gardner. 'The ladies all wear expensive garments and the gentlemen drink expensive booze. But that still doesn't elevate the effort above the level of hopeful pretense,' wrote New York Times critic Bosley Crowther in his review. SHADOW ON THE WALL (1950) After a run of playing mostly wives and girlfriends, Reagan got a particularly meaty and serious role in this Pat Jackson-directed psychological crime thriller about a 6-year-old girl (Gigi Perreau) who loses her memory after witnessing the murder of her stepmother. Reagan played a doctor who endeavors to help cure the girl and makes some critical discoveries about the nature of the murder along the way. The New York Times said Reagan gave a 'beautiful and convincing' performance. THE NEXT VOICE YOU HEAR ... (1950) When God starts giving radio broadcasts in this odd little William A. Wellman film, a married couple (James Whitmore and Nancy Reagan) and their 11-year-old son living in suburban Los Angeles are forced to confront their own faith. Reagan was praised for her 'delightful' performance as the kind, gentle and very pregnant wife in the film. NIGHT INTO MORNING (1951) Reagan plays a widow who saves Ray Milland from his depression and drunkenness after his wife and child die tragically in a fire. Milland and Reagan were both applauded for their performances, but the melancholy story was seen as a bit of a letdown. HELLCATS OF THE NAVY (1957) This WWII-set film about a submarine commander charting minefields off the Japanese coast marks the only time Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan, already married for five years, shared the big screen. As the land-locked love interest, Nancy Reagan didn't have much to do besides fret though. It's far from a classic - in fact it's somewhat derided - but the film remains an interesting document of historical value just by nature of the fact that it features the future President and first lady. In March 1949, she signed a seven-year contract with MGM and relocated to Hollywood to star in movies. Pictured left and right in 1950 Share or comment on this article MOST WATCHED NEWS VIDEOS",

Monday meeting with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders before his rally at the Washington Avenue Armory. The video is below, but here?s what Sanders had to say in response to being told about the death of Donald Ivy, who died in Albany police custody last year after being stopped while walking down an Arbor Hill street around 12:30 a.m. ?What we should be doing is training police officers to deal with issues, although this doesn?t seem to me to be a terribly difficult issue. This is not like somebody with a weapon or anything. This is a guy walking down the street, right? ? Going home. That?s not exactly a major crime. What we don?t have yet is a culture in this country that says to the police departments that lethal force ? so in this case using a Taser seven times* ? is a last resort, not a first resort. Clearly in this particular case it could have been dealt with in a 100 different ways?.? *Note: While there are several references in the video to Ivy having been shocked with a Taser seven times (including in Sanders? response, in which he repeats the facts he was told about the case), the district attorney?s investigation of Ivy?s death concluded that although the trigger on the Taser was was pulled seven times, ?it is clear that Mr. Ivy was not effectively tasered all seven times.? In other words, some of those intended shocks missed either because the probes from the gun did not properly lodge or the officer was unable to hold the device against Ivy?s body, known as drive stunning. Ivy?s autopsy yielded physical evidence of one ? and potentially a second ? site on his body where he actually received an electrical shock. Here?s the relevant section from the district attorney?s report: Ivy, 39 was ruled to have died from cardiac arrest related to his underlying heart disease and enlarged heart, which according to the district attorney?s report ?made him particularly susceptible to a heart attack brought on by the stress of the incident with the police.?",

Please update your profile by clicking here. What you need to know about prescribing exercise 22 March, 2016 British Heart Foundation names medical director Exercise is neglected as a treatment for chronic conditions because doctors lack easy access to guidance on how to use it as a viable alternative to medication or surgery, claim Australian researchers. They say a wide range of conditions, including coronary heart disease, can respond well to exercise, yet it remains under-prescribed. ?Unless clinicians can access sufficient details about exercise interventions to prescribe them, they either guess at how to use them or do not use them at all,? says lead author Dr Tammy Hoffmann from Bond University. Even when doctors are not involved in delivering the exercise intervention, they should know the main elements so they can refer appropriately, she says. After reviewing the evidence for the effectiveness of exercise interventions for a range of chronic conditions, Dr Hoffmann and colleagues have created a how-to guide for doctors. For coronary heart disease, they looked at a Cochrane review of 47 RCTs including 10,794 participants with the condition that showed a reduction in overall mortality by 13% and of cardiovascular mortality by 26% for those assigned exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation. However, they caution that contraindications to exercise for patients with coronary heart disease include unstable ischaemia, uncontrolled heart failure or arrhythmias, uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes, acute systemic illness or fever, severe and symptomatic valvular heart disease or any other cardiac condition that the doctor believes is life-threatening. Published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, the review presents exercise by disease type and lists the type of health care provider to administer the exercise, materials needed, benefits and other information such as contraindications. The researchers note some exercise can be prescribed by GPs while others need referrals to specialists and allied health professionals.

265,BLOG,amerika.org,http://www.amerika.org/lifestyle/hating-breitbart-2012/,7/28/2016,16:00:19,,,"Hating Breitbart is not a complex documentary, but it gains insight into two vital points: where Andrew Breitbart succeeded, and where he could not go that the next generation of his staff could. The movie approaches his life in the kind of high school simple method of Fox News but with a new dimension: gut-wrenchingly profound moments of clear articulation in a sea of nonsense. Mr. Breitbart, as star of the show, makes a clear point resounding well: liberals (Leftists) are a swarming force within Western Civilization that aims at its destruction through their own pretentious egotism. ?You destroy people,? he accuses, and then the film goes on to show us how liberals have attempted to destroy Breitbart, filmmaker James O?Keefe, and the Tea Party with their universal accusations of ?racism.? As any readers here know, when a liberal cries ?racism? it means that a non-liberal has stuck up for himself and his people. Before Breitbart, few people were willing to slaughter that sacred cow, but if anything, this film will convince the normal viewer to ignore or retaliate against accusations of racism, seeing them through Breitbart?s eyes as what they are: an attempt to silence political non-conformists, using a perception of collective guilt and the begging-the-question fallacy that is an accusation of double-think, since by defending himself the person under attack must confirm the accusation to some degree. Breitbart comes across as the pugnacious, intelligent, principled and humorous character that he was (Andrew Breitbart died in 2012 of rumored heart failure) and makes the best case for himself. The filmmakers poke into the controversies he has generated, showing his point of view, which seems mostly accurate with some rough edges. But what makes the film most compelling are the moments of confrontation it captures with liberals. In particular, the liberals interviewed for and caught on tape for this film seem to follow a set pattern: say something true, then extend that as if it were a metaphor to cover far more than it does, and end with a nasty insinuation about the people who are not liberal. Whether or not Breitbart is terrible, he is not as bad as they say in the ways that they say, and this makes the film convincing. Hating Breitbart captures its subject in some powerful moments: explaining how media made itself obsolete by turning into an unpaid propaganda wing of the Left, demonstrating how liberals are motivated by a pathological hatred, showing how liberals refuse to answer truthfully even basic questions about their own work. Even a skeptic would see that whether or not he is all correct, he is not all wrong. Generally, documentaries rank lower on the ?fun? scale than high colonics. Hating Breitbart is best viewed as a ninety-minute op-ed in which Andrew Breitbart defends himself and his allies. He repeatedly makes the point that liberals are motivated by destruction, that they lie, and that they control media, and if America absorbs that, it will be far ahead of where it was. This film presents those distillations in a simple and enjoyable form.",

Dihydropyridine CCBs are also first-line in this setting. These drugs do not improve mortality in heart failure, in contrast to drugs like (but not limited to) ARBs/ACEi which do. But in the absence of heart failure, the latter won't further improve mortality unless one is diabetic. Essentially one shouldn't consider thiazides and dCCBs unless the heart is perfectly okay. I personally would never prescribe a thiazide because of their link to diabetes, unless it's a generally fit lad with calcium stones (thiazides decrease urinary calcium).

Researchers found that about half of the 1,818 adults in their study of middle-aged and older Hispanics/Latinos had cardiac dysfunction, yet fewer than 1 in 20 participants knew they had a problem. Cardiac dysfunction is particularly serious because it can develop into heart failure, a chronic disease in which the heart pumps less blood than the body needs to remain healthy. ""The perception has been that Hispanics/Latinos are a low-risk group for cardiac dysfunction, but that is not true,"" said Carlos J. Rodriguez, M.D., M.P.H., study senior author and associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He noted that the only other large study of cardiac dysfunction in the United States looked at an older, largely non-Hispanic white population and found that about a third had cardiac dysfunction. In the Echocardiographic Study of Hispanics/Latinos (ECHO-SOL), researchers used ultrasound images of the heart to identify cardiac dysfunction in adults, age 45-74, living in the Bronx, Chicago, Miami and San Diego. Among participants who had high rates of risk factors for cardiac dysfunction: half were obese; half had high blood pressure; two-thirds had diabetes; two-thirds reported low levels of physical activity; and one fifth were current smokers. Researchers noted that these risk factors, along with heart attack, were the same risk factors for progression of cardiac dysfunction to heart failure. Given the study's findings, Rodriguez said, health professionals should have ""a high level of vigilance"" when it comes to monitoring the health of their Hispanic/Latino patients and a ""low threshold for intensifying preventative therapies to avoid the possibility of heart failure down the road."" He added that the earlier the intervention, the better, noting that some studies have suggested that cardiac dysfunction can be reversed by aggressive reduction of risk factors. ECHO-SOL diagnosed two types of cardiac dysfunction: left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD). In LVSD, the left ventricle, the heart's largest chamber, does not push blood out to the body as forcefully as it should. In LVDD, the left ventricle is too stiff when relaxed between beats to gather enough blood in its chamber. Researchers said that the prevalence of the second type, LVDD, was particularly high among Latino-Americans from Central America, whose risk was nearly double that of Mexican-Americans. Researchers said that they did not know whether ancestry or environment explained the difference. Rodriguez said that because Hispanics/Latinos have been overlooked in previous studies, there are no reliable estimates of how many with cardiac dysfunction will develop heart failure. Researchers plan to continue following ECHO-SOL participants to begin to answer that question. ""Given that Hispanics/Latinos are the largest ethnic minority in the United States, with over 51 million people, they are likely to have a big impact on the heart failure epidemic,"" he said.",

Diets rich in fruits and vegetables and whole grains, low in red and processed meats, and low in refined grain were related to lower risk for gestational diabetes and also a lower risk for type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure later, said senior investigator Dr. Cuilin Zhang in email to Reuters Health. Gestational diabetes, which often has no symptoms, affects about 200,000 U.S. women each year. From 1989 to 2011, the researchers tracked almost 4,000 women in the Nurses? Health Study II with a history of gestational diabetes. Over an average of 18 years, 1,069 women developed high blood pressure. Women with the healthiest diets were about 25 percent less likely to develop high blood pressure than those with the least healthy diets, the researchers reported in the journal Hypertension. Fiber from whole grains and legumes could help improve the way the body processes sugar and handles inflammation, said Zhang, who works at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at the National Institutes of Health in Rockville, Maryland. Fruits and vegetables contain high potassium and vitamin K, ascorbic acid and antioxidants, which could help the heart and blood vessels, she added. A healthy diet helps reduce the risk of high blood pressure for all people, not just women who?ve had gestational diabetes, she said. The new results are not surprising, said Dr. Cheryl Bushnell of Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston Salem, North Carolina, who was not part of the new study. ?The healthy diets in this study all emphasize nutrients (fruits and vegetables, fresh vs. non-processed food) that are high in potassium and low in sodium, both of which can help lower blood pressure,? Bushnell told Reuters Health by email. High blood pressure ?is the single-most modifiable risk factor for stroke, so avoiding (it) will help reduce the risk for stroke,? she said. ?Other major conditions associated with (high blood pressure) include heart disease, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease, all of which shorten the life expectancy.? Women should discuss their history of gestational diabetes with their doctors, Bushnell said. And doctors should encourage women who had diabetes in pregnancy to adopt a healthy diet after giving birth, Zhang said. SOURCE: http://bit.ly/1kLRX1U Hypertension, online April 18, 2016.",

After the successful transplant, the man now carries his artificial heart around in a backpack. Dailymail revealed that Andrew Jones, from Conneticut, first became unwell in 2012 after struggling to breathe during a run. He was horrified when two years later he started to cough up blood and developed a high fever. In hospital, doctors diagnosed the 26-year-old with cardiomyopathy - a hereditary disease of the heart muscle - and soon he became so weak he couldn't stand, walk or dress himself. Just months later, he was told he can only survive if a transplant was immediately carried out. However, because there were no organs available, he was fitted with a pacemaker and an artificial heart - which he now carries around in a bag on his back. RONALDO SET TO LUNCH HIS MEGA HOTEL Now, he is back to the gym and said he cries after workouts as he feels so 'thankful to be alive'. Recalling suffering from heart failure, Mr Jones said: 'It's something I would never want to wish upon my worst enemy. 'You can't breathe, you can't think, you don't eat and you don't sleep. He continued: ' Living with this disease put me in a pattern with depression and physical pain. 'I had to stop working because I wouldn't be able to stand for more than 10 minutes. 'I dreaded going to the kitchen because that meant that I had to go up and down my stairs. 'I couldn't even get dressed without panting and gasping for air - my life was falling apart and I just wanted relief.' Mr Jones even launched his own charity, Hearts at Large, to raise awareness for organ donations and has over 14,000 followers on his Instagram, @FitnessWithAJ. FATHER IMPREGNATE HIS DAUGHTER AND TRIES TO ABORT IT Grateful to be alive, he breaks down in tears at the gym as he is so happy he is still able to train.

Some of our doctors left for furlough or conferences leaving a bit more work for the rest of us. On top of that, our highlands regional referral hospital closed its doors after all of the staff there walked out on strike. Needless to say, the patients are streaming in ... The same weekend that three of our doctors left, I took an emotional hit on the wards. A little girl came to the hospital with spastic movements and seizures - my second case of tetanus in two years. The next day, I saw a familiar face on the ward. One of our nurses, Josh, suffered a seizure at home after a severe headache and was paralyzed lying on the floor. Since his graduation from nursing school last year, Josh and I have played soccer together. But now, it seemed he had a sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, and I could do almost nothing to help him. Then the never-ending stream of patients - some using up their savings to make it to Kudjip from far reaches of the country. With bone infections, HIV, Tuberculosis, heart failure, tumors, meningitis, cancer and a myriad of other ailments. By the end of most work-days I was just ready to sleep, but needed to be available for call a few nights as well. But each morning I lost a little more heart as my patients still suffered seizures, or children died in the night or in my hands the next morning. And I wondered where the strength would come from for more of the same work. ""You have not wearied yourselves on my behalf"" -Isaiah 43:22 I remember working long hours in residency, spending day after day in the hospital and many nights as well. Juggling paperwork, checking on patients, going to the clinic, grabbing a few frantic bites to eat and coming home many days drained of my energy. I remember thinking that medicine must be an ungodly profession to demand so much. I remember planning on the glorious days after my training was over when I could have a more reasonable schedule. I wonder now where I got the idea that God would call me to something with a ""nice schedule"" ""Thou hast willed that through labour and pain I should walk the upward way; be Thou then my fellow traveller as I go."" -John Baillie As I continued working through the crowds, I remember praying for strength and encouragement to come. I knew I was wearied, but I trusted that my weariness was on His behalf. And I put another foot in front of the other, shouldering bigger loads than usual, but realizing that a grace beyond me kept me going. A grace that brought me back to the same wards, the same emergency room, the same stony ground - but with a new strength. Karapen is a pastor in our area who comes to the hospital every couple of weeks or so. Sometimes Karapen needs medicines or a new problem looked at. This isn't surprising given his age, which I would guess to be about 70. But many times I think he enjoys the fellowship and company of the doctors here. Karapen has planted churches throughout Papua New Guinea. And during our short-staffed week, he came to my room needing a new supply of medicines because he was going to help open a church in Enga, a remote province requiring a significant journey for this faithful servant. I wrote his prescriptions and tried to encourage him, but I could feel the line building up as the minutes ticked away. But Karapen, as usual, slowed me down. I wrote some time ago about looking for the one patient each day that I should minister to in the midst of a streaming line of hurting and needy people. That day, I was grateful that for Karapen - I was the one. He set down his cane and put his weathered hands on mine and prayed that I would have strength for the work of the hospital, and then prayed for my entire family by name, asking that God would give us grace to continue the work here. And that grace met me. In the smiles around me. In the patients who could see my fatigue and put their arms on me and pray for me. In the nurses who pick up extra work (in spite of their pay cuts) to make things a bit easier for the doctors. In the miraculous recoveries of my patients. And most of all in the felt presence of that fellow traveler, who at times interrupts my labour and pain to show me that my weariness is truly a part of the upward way. Josh - healed, now back to work. Tetanus no more.",

Hanumanthappa Koppad was rescued late on Monday after spending six days trapped on the world's highest battlefield after a massive block of ice fell onto his army post. Indian students pray near a sand sculpture created by Sudarsan Pattnaik of Hanumanthappa Koppad,(Photo:AFP) Troops discovered Koppad, with a faint pulse and suffering from severe injuries, after digging through the snow on the Siachen glacier in the disputed region of Kashmir. His rescue from the disaster, which occurred 5,900 metres (19,600 feet) high in the Himalayas and killed nine of his colleagues, has gripped India, with schoolchildren, priests and Bollywood stars praying for his recovery. But doctors warned on Wednesday his condition was worsening, saying he was comatosed and his organs were failing to function. ""Doctors declared him dead around 11:45am,"" Indian Army spokesman Rohan Anand told AFP. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had visited Koppad at his hospital bedside in New Delhi, said his death ""leaves us sad & devastated"". ""RIP Lance Naik Hanumanthappa. The soldier in you remains immortal. Proud that martyrs like you served India,"" Modi tweeted. An estimated 8,000 soldiers have died on the glacier since 1984, almost all of them from avalanches, landslides, frostbite, altitude sickness or heart failure rather than combat. India and archrival Pakistan are each estimated to deploy around 3,000 troops on the glacier, where winter temperatures plummet to minus 70 degrees Celsius. The nuclear-armed neighbours fought a fierce battle over Siachen in 1987, though guns on the glacier have largely fallen silent since a peace process began in 2004. The Kashmir region - of which Siachen is a part - is divided between Pakistan and India but is claimed by both in full.",

The cause of death was congestive heart failure. Mrs. Reagan will be buried at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, next to her husband, Ronald Wilson Reagan, who died on June 5, 2004. Prior to the funeral service, there will be an opportunity for members of the public to pay their respects at the Library. Details will be announced shortly. In lieu of flowers, Mrs. Reagan requested that contributions be made to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Foundation at www.reaganlibrary.com. For continuous information on the week's events, please visit the Reagan Library's web site at www.reaganlibrary.com. A biography of Nancy Reagan is below. Office of Nancy Reagan Nancy Davis Reagan July 6, 1921 - March 6, 2016 Nancy Davis Reagan was born on July 6, 1921, in New York City. Raised in Chicago, she graduated from Girls' Latin School and went on to Smith College, Northampton, Mass., where she graduated in 1943. In her early career, Nancy Davis worked as an actress in stage, film and television productions. In 1949, she signed a seven-year contract with MGM. During this time, she met Ronald Reagan and they were married on March 4, 1952. She made eleven films in all, including three after her marriage. Her last film, at Columbia in 1956, was Hellcats of the Navy, the only film in which she and her husband appeared together. Shortly after Ronald Reagan became Governor of California in 1967, Mrs. Reagan began visiting wounded Vietnam veterans and became active in projects concerning POWs and servicemen missing in action. While First Lady of California, she made regular visits to hospitals and homes for the elderly, as well as schools for physically and emotionally handicapped children. During one of these hospital visits in 1967, she observed participants in the Foster Grandparent Program, a program which brings together senior citizens and handicapped children, and she soon became its champion. Later, as First Lady of the United States, Mrs. Reagan continued to help expand the program on a national level and promote private funding in local communities. Upon becoming First Lady of the United States, Mrs. Reagan's primary focus was fighting drug and alcohol abuse among youth. To spotlight the problem, she traveled nearly 250,000 miles throughout the United States and abroad in conjunction with her campaign to fight substance abuse. She appeared on television talk shows, taped public service announcements, wrote guest articles, and visited prevention programs and rehabilitation centers to talk with young people and their parents. After leaving the White House on January 20, 1989, Mrs. Reagan established the Nancy Reagan Foundation to continue her campaign to educate people about the serious dangers of substance abuse. In 1994, the Nancy Reagan Foundation joined forces with the BEST Foundation For A Drug-Free Tomorrow and developed the Nancy Reagan Afterschool Program, a drug prevention and life-skills program for youth. For ten years, Mrs. Reagan's priority was caring for her husband at home as he battled Alzheimer's Disease. Following his death in 2004, she was devoted to projects related to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, where she served on the board of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, and promoted her husband's legacy of leadership and freedom. Nancy Davis Reagan was the only daughter of Dr. Loyal Davis and Edith Davis of Chicago and Phoenix. She is survived by her brother, Dr. Richard Davis, and two children with Ronald Reagan -- Patti Davis and Ronald Prescott Reagan, along with numerous nieces and nephews.

While Presley, 48, and her rocker husband are desperate to keep themedical crisis a secret, an immediate family member confessed that the surgery will take place ?sooner rather than later.? Lockwood, 54, needed emergency medical treatment for his heart last Thanksgiving weekend. ?Michael was undergoing a stress test on a treadmill at his doctor?s office when his heart started to race out of control,? the source told Radar. ?It was beating so wildly that he was scared it would burst out of his chest and explode. He thought for sure he was a goner.? After the terrifying incident, the doctor used a defibrillator to keep Lockwood alive before he was rushed to a hospital near the couple?s Franklin, Tennessee, home. ?Michael is likely suffering from atrial fibrillation, also known as AFib,? NYC-based internist Dr. Stuart Fischer, who has not treated the guitar player, told Radar. ?It is characterized by a quivering or irregular heartbeat called an arrhythmia.? The doctor warned that if the deadly condition is left untreated, ?arrhythmia can lead to stroke, which is the number one complication, as well as blood clots, heart failure and other heart-related complications.? Still, there are medical procedures that can help with the father-of-two?s heart-wrenching condition. ?The procedure done to correct this is an ablation, and involves threading a wire into the area of the heart that?s causing the arrhythmia and shutting off its trigger point,? Fischer explained. While Lockwood?s health continues to decline, the insider claimed that the music producer has made some necessary lifestyle changes. However, he?s still far from where he should be, the source added. ?He?s changed some things but still struggles with others. He still eats a lot of junk and processed foods,? the source told Radar. ?Up until recently he?d been walking around like a ticking time bomb, suffering in silence and keeping his health problem a secret, even from Lisa Marie. Now that she knows, it?s scaring the living bejesus out of her? His day of reckoning has finally come.?",

I began suffering from blinding migraines which a times lasted for days. I was given more pills to take, Amitriptyline, they just made me more sleepy. I have had bouts of falling asleep a work and driving my car. Then the joint pains and swelling started, I was given Cocodamol and Naproxen. Some days my eyes are so puffy I can barely open them. 18 months ago I decided enough was enough and stopped taking the meds. The doctor was not happy , since then I have experimented with all the meds taking less etc to see If i can feel better. My sister was recently diagnosed with Hashimotos Disease and her specialist has recommended that we all get checked out (all the girls in he family have hypo). It was at this time I asked for a referral to the specialist. this was denied many times which led me to finally do a patient referral. I then was diagnosed with a severe vit D deficiency, but the swelling are now lumps like golf balls on my ankles and knees. If I exert myself I am exhausted the next day and struggle to get out of bed. I have now seen a specialist who was rude and told me that I am a risk of heart failure and coma. All he wants me to do is take T4 and unless I am prepared to take it there is no point seeing him. I would like T3 (he refused this and told me that it was unconventional treatment) or to be fully examined. It seems clear to me that I have a significant problem other than hypothyroidism but no one is prepared to make the links or listen to me. What can I do?",

Regular exercise is the key to fitness and health and its role can ever be over-emphasised in the maintenance of general health of the body. Exercise can help one lose weight, build immunity, enhance resistance, relieve joint pains and body aches, and generally keep us healthy and fit. It is prescribed by all doctors irrespective of your age, although the type of exercise may differ, but one thing is for sure and that is that there are hardly any downsides to exercising. A little exercise every day is one of the best and easiest ways to stay healthy and fit. The following are some of the best forms of exercises to do: 1. Swimming Touted as one of the best workout routines out there, swimming exercises almost all muscles of the body making it a complete workout in its own right. It is also one of the most enjoyable forms of exercise and hence feels more like relaxation rather than a strenuous workout. The water buoyancy supports the body of the swimmer and takes pressure off of painful joints enabling the body to move more fluidly. It is especially beneficial for people with arthritis since because it is less weight bearing. Swimming is also known to lift spirits and better the mood of a person. It is also especially good for toning up of the body and burning off calories. 2. Tai Chi It is essentially a Chinese Martial Arts form that is a combination of movement as well as relaxation, and hence is good for both the body and the mind. It has also been called ?meditation in motion? because of the calming effect it has as well as the relaxation spaces in between. Tai Chi consists of a series of graceful movements, all of which flow languidly and smoothly into the next one. Tai Chi helps boost muscle strength, increase flexibility of the body and maintain balance. Tai Chi is especially helpful with the following ailments and diseases ? Arthritis, Low Bone Density, Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, Heart Failure, Hypertension, Parkinson?s disease, Sleep Problems, and Stroke. 3. Walking Walking is the easiest exercise to do but is extremely beneficial at the same time. It helps one stay slim, lowers cholesterol levels, strengthens bones, keeps blood pressure within the safety limit, uplifts the mood, and lowers the risk of numerous diseases, specially diabetes and heart diseases. Studies have also proved that walking improves memory and can be an effective resistant to age related memory loss. Walking is also known to strengthen the heart and prevent dementia and osteoporosis. It also not only helps lose weight but also tones the legs and abdomen. Walking is also known to boost Vitamin D levels and provide energy spurts. All in all walking provides numerous benefits with minimal effort and is a fun way of exercising. 4. Kegel Exercises These exercises do not have an outwardly manifestation i.e., they do not help you look slimmer or better. Instead, they strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, the primary function of which is to support the bladder. They mainly help to avoid urinary incontinence, which is colloquially known as a ?leaky bladder?. Although avoided by most people due to the awkward and embarrassing subject, kegel exercises are a must to prevent such situations and to keep the bladder muscles strong and in control. 5. Aerobics Aerobic exercises are basically all those exercises that require an elevated consumption of oxygen by the body as compared to all other activities or exercises. It is generally of a mid-level density and can go on for long durations as well without excessive tiring of the body. Examples of aerobic exercises could be jogging, cycling, walking or swimming. Dancing could also be considered a form of aerobics. The biggest benefit of aerobic exercises is that they vastly enhance cardiovascular fitness by increasing the body?s capacity to utilise oxygen. The heart thus pumps fresh blood in greater quantities to all organs, optimizing their function. It is also known to reduce risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure, lower blood cholesterol, and avoid colon and breast cancer. Aerobic exercises are also immensely helpful in losing weight, and can be extensively used to maintain a steady weight loss regime. They also substantially lower the risk of muscular atrophies or degeneration, osteoporosis, or any other muscle or bone related problems, while generally boosting overall health. So these were some of the some of the various forms of exercises that one can do to stay in the best of health. Exercising is one of those activities one should include in their daily routine, for it is a known and well established fact that exercising is one of the first and major step towards a healthy lifestyle. What I am trying to convey through this article is that you need not necessarily go to gym in order to stay fit. There is a whole different world out there full of various bodily activities to maintain the perfect fitness level . All you need to do now is to go out there and explore!

Researchers from the two centers found that abdominal obesity -- or having an apple-shaped body -- is a strong predictor of serious heart disease in patients who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and haven't displayed any symptoms of heart disease. Apple-shaped bodies are already associated with metabolic syndrome (which includes high blood pressure, high sugar levels and high cholesterol), as well as coronary artery disease and heart failure, but this new study found that waist circumference is also a strong predictor of left ventricular dysfunction in patients. Metabolic syndrome is often accompanied by excess body fat around the abdomen. The collaborative team of researchers studied 200 diabetic men and women who had not yet exhibited any coronary disease. The researchers found that even independently of total body weight and body mass index or BMI, abdominal obesity was strongly associated with regional left ventricular dysfunction, which is a common cause of heart disease, including congestive heart failure. Results of the study will be reported at the 2016 American College of Cardiology Scientific Session in Chicago on Saturday, April 2. ""Our research examined patients with diabetes, who are considered high risk for developing heart disease already, and found that the shape of your body determined if you were at a greater risk to develop left ventricular dysfunction,"" said Brent Muhlestein, co-director of research at the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Salt Lake City. ""This study confirms that having an apple-shaped body -- or a high waist circumference -- can lead to heart disease, and that reducing your waist size can reduce your risks,"" adds Dr. Muhlestein. Studies show a strong correlation between weight gain and regional left ventricular function -- and obesity is a major worldwide health risk. One in three people will have cardiovascular disease in their lifetime, and about a third of them will die from a heart attack or similar malfunction before their heart disease is diagnosed. The results of the new research expands on the results of a previously published study called faCTor-64, also conducted by researchers at Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute and Johns Hopkins, which showed that the greater a person's body mass index, the greater their risk of heart disease. FaCTor-64 enrolled patients with diabetes who were considered to be at high risk for heart attacks, strokes, or death but had no evidence of heart disease as of yet. Study participants completed randomized screening for coronary artery disease by CT coronary angiography, then received recommendations to change their care or their lifestyles, or continue routine standard diabetes care, based on their results. They were then followed to track future adverse heart events. During the new study, 200 participants who received CT screenings also had echocardiography to assess their left ventricular function. The left ventricle is the chamber of the heart that pumps oxygen-rich blood to the brain and the body. When there's a dysfunction in the left ventricle, blood backs up into the lungs and lower extremities, which often leads to heart failure and increases the risk of sudden cardiac arrest. Although any form of obesity can produce stress on the heart, the new Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute/Johns Hopkins study shows that abdominal obesity, more so than total body weight or BMI (weight to height ratio), is a strong predictor of left ventricle dysfunction. ""We specifically found that waist circumference appears to be a stronger predictor for left ventricle dysfunction than total body weight or body mass index,"" says Boaz D. Rosen, MD, of Johns Hopkins, who is the study's principal investigator Dr. Rosen says further studies are needed to verify these findings. ""It will be important to see if these patients are indeed at risk of developing heart failure or coronary artery disease in the future,"" he added.",

Blood pressure is the force of the blood pushed against the the wall of the arteries, according to Nurse Practicioner Deborah Bergman, MS, RN, speaking to the Northwestern Memorial Healthy Transitions Program ?. Bergman explained that blood pressure depends on the strength of the heartbeat, thickness and volume of the blood, the elasticity of the artery walls and general health. It is the arterial pressure of the circulation. It is a dynamic process and fluctuates all day. She said that blood pressure (BP) varies between a maximum (systolic) pressure ? working phase. And the minimum (diastolic) pressure ? the resting phase. Average blood pressure decreases as the blood moves away from the heart through the arteries. It drops most rapidly around the small arteries and continues to decrease as it moves through the capillaries and back to the heart through the veins. Normal BP is 120/80, systolic/diastolic. Prehypertensive is 120-139 over 80-89. Stage one hypertension is 140-159 over 90 ? 99. Stage two hypertension reads 160 -179 over 100 ? 109. Modifiable causes of high BP or hypertension include smoking, obesity, lack of physical activity, dietary salt, alcohol consumption and stress. Causes of high BP over which we have no control include older age, genetics, family history of high BP, chronic kidney disease and adrenal and thyroid disorders. The Mayo Clinic said that most people with high BP have no signs of symptoms, even if BP readings reach dangerously high levels. ?Although a few people with early-stage high blood pressure may have dull headaches, dizzy spells or a few more nosebleeds than normal, these signs and symptoms typically don?t occur until high blood pressure has reached a severe ? even life-threatening ? stage. ?Ask your doctor for a blood pressure reading at least every two years starting at age 20. He or she will likely recommend more frequent readings if you?ve already been diagnosed with high blood pressure or other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.? Bergman said that high BP makes the heart work harder to pump blood. It contributes to hardening of the arteries or atherosclerosis as well as the development of heart failure. Persistent hypertension is one of the risk factors for strokes, heart attacks, heart failure, arterial aneurysms and is the leading cause of chronic renal failure. The good news is that there are many resources for checking our blood pressure, so no one needs to be ignorant of his condition. There are often machines in large drug store chains which are free and give reasonably accurate readings. Tony",

Any time a celebrity or public figures dies suddenly, people are always in a state of sorrow. The media shows ordinary citizens shedding tears and laying flowers while biographical programs air non-stop for several days. However, everyone is missing the point. These sudden deaths raise red flags and very well could indicate foul play at the hands of the Illuminati. The untimely death of one of the most heroic Supreme Court justices in recent memory, Antonin Scalia, happened under exactly the same circumstances that should raise eyebrows. His conservative stands on homosexuality, freedom of religion, and abortion were nothing short of monumental in this day and age. Though, he still served the Illuminati when it came to financial issues. His ensuring that the court's decision in Citizens v. United was favorable to the big banks contributed to the stealing of more power and influence for the secret order. His death came at a time when the court was supposed release several controversial decisions, most notably on labor unions and abortion, and Scalia's staunch conservatism was likely incompatible with the Illuminati's plans. Abortion in and of itself is inherently evil, and institutions such as Planned Parenthood engage in Satanic human sacrifice rituals in the name of ""protecting"" women's health. Those that stand with them are brainwashed or part of the Illuminati. Labor unions on the other hand are the secret order's true grassroots campaign. This is where they organize the masses and convince them that they have ""rights"" to which they have absolutely no entitlement. Fortunately, labor unions were smacked down by the hand of God and have little relevance in our great nation. That all may change now with Scalia's death and the Supreme Court's inability to reach a majority. Where Scalia's heroism was the greatest was his dissenting stand in Obergefell v. Hodges. This is the case that has now made it legal for homosexuals to desecrate the institution of marriage with their Satanic lifestyles. He wrote that by permitting same-sex marriage, the U.S. was essentially denying the people the right to govern themselves. This was a direct reference to the Illuminati's gradual takeover of our society, and it may have been too much for the order to tolerate. Our world is now a careful balancing act where the Illuminati is taking over but doing it slowly, like a frog in boiling water. Those in high power are part of that act. Some, such as the liberals seeking to undo all that is good, are obvious Illuminati operatives. Others take on a more subtle role. Scalia was one of those people. He maintained an aura of conservatism while granting more control to the banks and ensuring that George W. Bush (a member of one of America's highest Illuminati families and the person who turned the Republican party satanic) became president. Unfortunately for Scalia who must have had a change of heart, he let slip too much or was planning to draw the line which discomforted his masters. The likely official cause of death for Justice Scalia is congestive heart failure. In other words, he died in his sleep for no apparent reason. This might be more believable if he was 89 or lacked access to proper healthcare, but the cause comes across as suspicious. What is also peculiar is how quickly the U.S. Marshals and FBI stated that no foul play was involved. Is a window of a few hours enough to make that determination, especially prior to an autopsy if one is even being done. The thing is that modern medicine and cardiology are at amazing levels today. People who are under the care of physicians are increasingly unlikely to die without warning from a health issue. Another thing to consider is how fast drugs can work to either cause a heart attack or kill someone outright. So his death appears very similar to that of Marilyn Monroe who did not commit suicide but was murdered. Hopefully, we will know the full truth about the death of Antonin Scalia but that probably will not happen. Our best hope is that an Illuminati defector breaks ranks and lets the alternative media know what actually happened. Until then, we must rely on connecting the dots released by our dishonest government and corrupt media. Remember to look for those red flags. They mean more than anyone might let on.",

A new study has drawn a correlation between heart health and alcohol based on hospital records in Texas. ?The analysis found that people living in dry counties, where sales of alcoholic beverages are prohibited, had a higher risk of being hospitalized for a heart attack or congestive heart failure than people living in wet counties, where such sales are allowed. But residents of wet counties were at elevated risk for a heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation?Prevalence of atrial fibrillation was about 5% higher in wet counties, while prevalence of heart attacks was 17% lower. New hospitalizations for afib during the study were 7% higher in wet counties while those for heart attack were 9% lower.? While drinking in moderation is not necessarily harmful, make sure to steer clear of excessive alcohol consumption or binge drinking. (WSJ) Those with dementia should stop driving as their disease progresses. So far, no cognitive tests have been able to figure out if and when it is safe for a dementia patient to operate a car. ?People with dementia have up to eight times the odds of being in a car accident compared with other seniors. But in the early stages of the condition, people with a dementia diagnosis can often drive safely, the study team writes in the Journal of The American Geriatrics Society?? A person does not need to give up their license and right to drive as soon as they are diagnosed. However, he or she will need to be monitored by doctors and family members and eventually stop driving in the future. (Fox) Forgiveness may be the key to helping you manage stress. A small preliminary study looked at the correlation between forgiveness, stress, and mental health. Researchers hypothesized that the ability to cope could make stress more manageable. ?[They] looked at the effects of lifetime stress on a person?s mental health, and how more forgiving people fared compared to people who weren?t so forgiving. No surprise, people with greater exposure to stress over their lifetimes had worse mental and physical health. But the researchers also discovered that if people were highly forgiving of both themselves and others, that characteristic alone virtually eliminated the connection between stress and mental illness.?

Watch the documentary and hear what this life-saving and life-changing innovation means to the most important person?a patient. This new documentary details the development of the SynCardia Total Artificial Heart and its direct predecessor, the Jarvik 7. Like a heart transplant, the TAH-t is the only approved device that eliminates end-stage biventricular (both sides) heart failure. This fatal condition results when the native heart?s two ventricles can no longer pump enough blood for a patient to survive. Watch The Retro Reports / New York Times documentary on the SynCardia Total Artificial Heart (below) and learn more about this life-saving medical device. Learn the history and modern use of the SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart (TAH-t) from the world premiere of a 12-minute Retro Report documentary, which re-examines this leading story of the past and brings you through to today?s news. Through personal stories of surgeons and SynCardia Total Artificial Heart patients, this documentary takes the audience from the first use of a Total Artificial Heart for permanent use in 1982 to today?s use as a bridge to a donor heart transplant . A Change of Heart ? New York Times ? March 20, 2016 Produced by Retro Report for The New York Times , this documentary traces the modern-day SynCardia Heart full circle from its origins as a permanent heart to successfully pioneering use as a bridge to transplant to a new FDA clinical study for permanent use. ?Use of SynCardia?s Total Artificial Heart Technology has gone full circle,? says Michael P. Garippa, SynCardia?s CEO and President. ?The first implants were for permanent use. For the last 30 years the TAH-t has been used as a bridge to transplant. Now we are in an FDA Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) clinical study for 19 destination therapy patients who do not qualify for a donor heart transplant.? ?This study is generating data on the effective use of the SynCardia Heart as a way for patients to recover from heart failure and continue with a near-normal lifestyle without a human heart,? Garippa says. CAUTION: The 70cc SynCardia Total Artificial Heart, when used for destination therapy, is an investigational device, limited by United States law to investigational use. The SynCardia Total Artificial Heart is by far the most used artificial heart in the world. From 1969 through February 24, 2016 there have been 1,623 artificial implants representing 13 different designs. Of those implants, 1,576 used the SynCardia TAH-t or its direct predecessors. This represents 96% of all artificial heart implants and accounts for 98% (520 years) of patient support Randy Sheppard shares his story of living with the SynCardia Total Artificial Heart and what comes next at the 2015 AZBio Awards About the SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart SynCardia Systems, Inc. in Tucson, Arizona is a medical technology company focused on developing and manufacturing the SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart (TAH-t). The SynCardia TAH-t is an implantable system designed to assume the full function of a failed human heart in patients suffering from end-stage biventricular (both sides) heart failure. The SynCardia TAH-t is the only total artificial heart that is commercially available in the United States, European Union and Canada for use as a bridge to donor heart transplantation. More than 1,560 implants of the SynCardia Total Artificial Heart account for over 520 patient years of life on the device. Since January 2012 more than 550 SynCardia Hearts have been implanted. The youngest patient to receive a SynCardia Heart was 9 years old; the oldest was 76 years old. The longest a patient has lived with a SynCardia Heart and received a successful donor heart transplant was nearly four years (1,473 days). SynCardia Systems also manufactures the Freedom? portable driver, which powers the SynCardia Heart while allowing clinically stable patients to be discharged from the hospital and live at home and in their communities. The Freedom? portable driver has been used by more than 235 patients, accounting for over 160 patient years of support.

Now, cardiologists are now turning to robotic technology to treat patients. Joyce Liptrap is an avid scrap-booker who loves saving memories of her active life, but it wasn?t so active two years ago when Joyce started losing her energy. ?I would be awakened in the night, or be sitting in the chair, just sitting still doing nothing, or sleeping, and it would just start pounding in my heart.? Joyce had atrial fibrillation, a problem with the electrical system in her heart. A life-long fluttering feeling was now a serious concern for her and her husband, Ronnie. ?I told Ronnie I wasn?t sure if I was dying. I wasn?t sure what was happening. It was just so different. A couple of episodes got really bad,? she explained. Cardiac electro-physiologist at the Florida Hospital Cardiovascular Institute Dr. Usman Siddiqui needed to perform a procedure called ablation. ?Usually, we either apply heat energy or cold energy to freeze or burn the tissue that is causing the problem.? In this case, Dr. Siddiqui used a new robotic system with magnetic navigation that allowed him to operate two devices at the same time. It?s called a Stereotaxis V-Drive Duo system. One robotic arm delivered the catheter that allowed doctors to visualize the area. ?This is a special kind of ultrasound machine or ultrasound catheter that we put inside the heart so we can have real time pictures,? Dr. Siddiqui explained. The other robotic arm delivered the catheter to ablate the area. ?As soon as I woke up, I knew I felt different,"" Liptrap said. ""I really didn?t feel the heaviness that I had felt.? What she did start to feel was more energy, giving her more opportunities to make new memories. Dr. Siddiqui said the catheters are very soft, almost like noodles, so there is very little chance of creating a hole or perforation during the procedure. He says the biggest benefit to patients is increased safety and accuracy. Also, in most cases, the procedure can be performed in less time, which may mean a shorter hospital stay.

It?s rare that a single treatment can provide dramatic improvements across such a broad range of health challenges. But that?s what makes stem cell therapy so powerful and unique. It unleashes the regenerative power of your body?s own stem cells, which are responsible for healing, growth, and replacement of cells damaged by injury, illness, aging , and normal wear and tear. And because stem cells are unspecialized and have the ability to change into various cell types, they can target a wide variety of tissues and organs. Here?s what a few of the many patients we?ve treated at Whitaker Wellness have to say about stem cell therapy. Stem Cell Therapy for Chronic Neck Pain ?I have had chronic neck pain for more than 10 years caused by bone spurs and arthritis , and I have had four epidural treatments to relieve the pain. Last year, I did stem cell therapy at Whitaker Wellness, and my neck has been pain free ever since.? ? Carol D., CA Stem Cells Benefit Parkinson?s Disease ?Since I had stem cell therapy to help control my Parkinson?s disease , I feel stronger and more enthusiastic, and activities such as dressing myself, buttoning my shirts, and tying my shoes keep getting easier and easier.? ? Richard O., WA Stem Cell Therapy Relieves Hip Pain ?It has only been four weeks since my stem cell therapy, but my limp is improving, and I feel less pain in both of my hip joints.? ? Rich M., CA No More MS Meds After Stem Cell Therapy ?I?ve had multiple sclerosis for more than 20 years. I?ve been on every MS medication available, but there were still times when I was unable to get out of bed, walk, talk, or feed myself, and I had to give up working as a hospice nurse. My daughter and I flew to California for the procedure in September. The results are far more than I could have ever imagined! Today I am on no prescription drugs , and I have hardly any signs of MS. I am back working as an RN and enjoying my family. We are able to plan activities and travel now, which is something we never could do before. I tell everyone about my experience with stem cell therapy at Whitaker Wellness and highly recommend it to anyone with a chronic illness.? ? Stacie R., TN Stem Cells Speed Healing From Injuries ?I was involved in a motorcycle accident in 1989 and sustained a spinal cord injury. With therapy I was able to walk again, but the right side of my body had limited mobility and use. After doing stem cell therapy, I have more strength and can stand for longer periods of time. Other gains, which surprised me, include improvements in my hearing and eyesight.? ? Craig C., CA Stem Cells Benefit Traumatic Brain Injury ?During the first year after our son?s traumatic brain injury, everyone kept saying he would hit a plateau, but we refused to accept that. Now James is on year four, and he?s still getting better and learning more every day. He is more independent and able to express himself better, and his medication doses have been cut in half. He is also much happier and less depressed. We attribute this to his hard work in physical therapy and the stem cell therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), and other treatments he has received at Whitaker Wellness.? ? James, Robert, and Marcia V., TX Stem Cell Therapy Improves COPD Symptoms ?In 2001, a pulmonologist diagnosed my shortness of breath as COPD . I was on oxygen at night and Advair by day, but my resting O 2 was falling below 90, and my energy was low. In May 2014, I had stem cell therapy and HBOT at Whitaker Wellness. To summarize: Stem cell therapy has boosted my oxygen, raised my energy level, and allows me at age 81 to continue living on my own with confidence and competence.? ? Janet N., AZ Widespread Benefits of Stem Cells ?I have a lot of problems due to multiple system atrophy. Stem cell therapy has helped me with my breathing, which is almost back to normal. I no longer wake up during the night unable to breathe. I now have feeling in the bottom of my feet, and my kidney disease has improved.? ? Bruce D., Canada Healing Benefits of Stem Cells?Hidden in Fat Stem cells are located in tissues throughout the body, but the most abundant source is fat . That?s right?your own fat is a treasure trove of rejuvenating stem cells! Bone marrow also contains reasonable numbers of stem cells, though far fewer than fat, but harvesting them is more invasive, and extensive incubation is required to obtain acceptable concentrations. Fat, on the other hand, is right there for the taking, and most of us have plenty to spare. We simply remove a small amount of fat (about 50 cc), usually from the abdominal area, through a minimal liposuction procedure performed in a certified outpatient surgical suite. The stem cells are then separated from the fat, concentrated and counted, and returned back into the patient via an intravenous infusion or, in some cases, injection directly into problematic areas. Regenerative Medicine at Its Best Once these concentrated cells are redeployed, the body?s own innate wisdom takes over. Signaled by inflammation , stem cells home in on damaged tissues, where they produce growth factors and other compounds necessary for repair and regeneration. Some of them, such as vascular endothelial growth factors and angiogenesis mediators, stimulate the production of new blood vessels to restore circulation and oxygen supply. Others prevent apoptosis (programmed cell death) or boost the formation of various cell types. Another stem cell benefit is that they curb excessive inflammation and help regulate the immune response, which is key to the therapy?s benefits for inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases. In addition to the improvements reported above by patients at Whitaker Wellness, fat-derived stem cells have been shown to help patients with bone and skin defects, heart attacks and heart failure, diabetes , cornea damage, tissue transplants, radiation injury, and cirrhosis, hepatitis, and other liver problems. Hundreds of registered clinical trials are currently underway to further study the use of fat-derived stem cells for many of our most debilitating and devastating disorders. If you ask your conventional doctor about stem cell therapy, you may be told it?s promising, the future of medicine even, but not ready for prime time. That may be an acceptable answer for healthy young people. But if you?re suffering with a chronic, intractable condition and need help now, I urge you to consider stem cell therapy. It?s safe, effective, and available today.

Focused on our biological process, their vitamins help nourish the body from the inside out to produce beautiful, age reducing results on our skin. A healthy diet, sensible sun protection and trying to combat stress levels can help reduce the signs of ageing, combined with taking Solgar?s latest vitamins you are doing the best you can without resorting to needles and a knife. Solgar has dedicated years to educating others about health, beauty and our skin. The reason our skin ages is because as we get older we produce less collagen (the protein that holds the body together and provides strength and structure). However, we can counteract this by taking in more collagen to slow down the aging process, and eating less foods (sugar, processed food, bad fats) that cause collagen loss. Collagen Hyaluronic Acid Complex Hyaluronic acid is often dubbed the ?anti-aging? nutrient. On top of eating well and making good lifestyle choices (green veggies and less stress!), taking this added supplement will help make skin look fresh and radiant. Foods to make sure you include in your diet that are good for skin; seaweeds, berries, cherries, eggs, fish, flaxseeds, nuts, garlic, homemade broth/stock. Foods that are rich in hyaluronic acid; root vegetables, greens- best eaten raw, chicken and other meat broths and beans. Drink lots of water, hyaluronic acid is more effective when it has an abundant amount of water with which to bind. If you live a busy life and can?t always maintain the perfect diet, the Collagen Hyaluronic Acid Complex contains the key ingredient of BioCell Collagen. BioCell is a patented ingredient that has three main components: hydrolysed collagen type II, chondroitin sulphate, and hyaluronic acid. Don?t be put off by the complexity of the name, these are all naturally occurring and have been certified for safety. The elements are key to better smooth skin and softening wrinkles for a younger appearance. The results of BioCell. Not only does it help skin health and collagen, but it also supports joint health. Each pack comes with 30 tablets for ?33.86. Nutri-Nano CoQ-10 3.1x This supplement helps support skin health, energy production, and cardiovascular health. This particular product has 3.1 better absorption of CoQ-10 (a compound that has antioxidant properties that help to protect skin cells). The heart stores the largest concentration of CoQ-10 because it uses so much energy, therefore this supplement is good for those who have developed congestive heart failure. Too much exposure to dangerous UV rays results in the development of Reactive Oxygen Species which damage DNA, proteins, and more. CoQ-10 helps combat and protect against ROS. It also plays an important role in Energy Production, because as we get older CoQ-10 reduces and we become tired earlier. By taking this supplement, harm done by UV rays is combated, energy increases, and overall skin health is improved. Each pack comes with 50 softgels for ?32.49. - All Solgar products are available in most health food stores and pharmacies nationwide. -",

My doctors believe that the chemotherapy that I had years ago left me susceptible to the heart virus that goes around and most people get rid of with no heart damage. I took my meds and ate right and exercised and then at age 37 in 2010 my EF declined and I had full blown heart failure symptoms just like you experienced. I immediately (like within 3 days of calling my doctor) received an ICD. Please do not worry about this surgery. It is very common and will go well. It is just one night in the hospital for most people. For many people the ICD will over time allow your heart to rest and your EF to go up. My EF went from 20% to 50% 18months after implantation. It is worth it. I have never been shocked but have had it correct a few arrhythmia's. And during this whole time of CHF and getting the ICD, we were scared and worried and really concerned about my future. Luckily things have turned around and I am now asymptomatic once again. I hope my story helps you",
302,FORUMS,anxietyzone.com,"http://www.anxietyzone.com/index.php/topic,122702.0.html#msg707544",7/2/2016,1:29:00,,,"I just registered here. Looks like a great resource, and one I am badly in need of. I'm going to resist my temptation to post a wall of text here detailing my history of anxiety and what not, but here are the broad strokes: I'm 43 and have not taken very good care of my body my whole life. Poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, etc. Which has left me obese, prediabetic, fatty liver, sleep apnea, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, etc. (Those are my real issues as diagnosed by doctors - the imagined ones are much worse). Of course, this has only made my health anxiety exponentially worse than it used to be. I've always had health anxiety, it's just gotten much worse as I've gotten older and started having real non-trivial health issues. In the past couple years, I've had 3 severe shortness of breath episodes which I am now fairly certain were just panic attacks. I had a treadmill test recently that confirmed that aside from being really out of shape, my heart and lungs are healthy. No signs of anything cardiac going on. So those episodes were very likely just anxiety related. But no sooner had I passed the treadmill test than I latched onto a new set of symptoms and hopped aboard the cancer scare train. I've gone back and forth between a few different types of cancer, and seem to be settling on colon cancer. No matter how many times I talk myself down from being convinced that I have colon cancer, I can't break free from the thought of """"yeah, but what if I really do have colon cancer?"""". My doctor doesn't seem overly concerned, but I think she has realized for quite some time (although never said it) that I'm a hypochondriac. Which of course only fans the flames of my anxiety, because it makes me feel like she's just seeing the little boy who cried wolf, and being too quick to dismiss my symptoms. Makes me wish I could just order expensive medical tests for myself as easily as ordering items off a restaurant menu. But I know better than to think that would ever truly quell my anxiety. It would only make me cycle quicker from one imagined disease to the next. Despite the anxiety, I've been making great strides at improving my health lately. I've lost a bunch of weight recently, started walking more, eating better, getting more sleep, etc. My blood pressure and cholesterol numbers have improved greatly, and I am hoping that someday soon I can stop taking meds for them. But even watching my health improve does little to allay my fears. Sometimes it even has the opposite effect, for example when I start thinking maybe I'm losing weight too easily/quickly (uh-oh, maybe it's cancer). So that's where I'm at. I'm glad I found this forum, because I was just doing Google searches for colon cancer symptoms a little while ago, and worked myself up enough that I couldn't go to sleep. Side note: I keep thinking how cruel it is to be a hypochondriac, knowing that eventually something *will* get me. It's like if you were paranoid about government agents trying to assassinate you, but instead of just being purely delusional, there really were government agents out to assassinate you, but instead of being hot on your heels and lurking behind every dark corner, they were really just down at the donut shop sipping coffee and taking their sweet time about it. Lastly, just for a bit of levity, here is a partial list of the things I've been convinced I was afflicted with (perhaps even dying of) in the past 5 years (in no particular order): *Colon cancer *Liver cancer *Prostate cancer *Testicular cancer *Salivary gland cancer *Tonsil cancer *Thyroid cancer *Coronary artery disease *Congestive heart failure *Abdominal aortic aneurism *Cirrhosis of the liver *Full-blown diabetes (I'm borderline prediabetic, and have been improving that with my recent weight loss, but it doesn't stop me from worrying that every scab on my leg is going to turn into an ulcer and get gangrene, or that the floater in my eye means I'm going blind, even though, as my doctor keeps reminding me, those are generally complications typically seen in advanced cases of diabetes after many years, or in cases of poorly managed diabetes). *Fungal infection of the sinus/throat *Various types of hernias *Early-onset Alzheimer's *All sorts of obscure diseases that I stumbled upon on Wikipedia, with names like Suchandsuch Syndrome, or Soandso's Disease, that I've since forgotten about. *Completely imaginary diseases that I created from whole cloth in my head, involving things like spinal degeneration, etc. Maybe some of these actually exist, or there are real diseases that share certain similarities, but it's probably best that I don't go looking for them on the Internet. Anyway, I think my purpose in joining this forum is probably much the same as a lot of you here. I'm looking for a way to ease my mind and stop wasting my days worrying about dying when I really ought to be enjoying living. Lastly, yeah, I know I said I was going to refrain from writing a wall of text, but trust me, this *is* the abbreviated version.",

He followed studies at the boarding school of St. John the Baptist brothers of the room, in Casseneuil, where he encountered difficulties because of his poor memory. At home and at the school, he received a solid Christian education and, gradually grew in him a deep desire to be a priest. Father Filhol, parish priest, saying much the boy, made him help in his studies by a vicar, but the lack of memory continued to prevent its entry in the minor seminary. However, the teenager was brought to silence, to contemplation and prayer. Father Filhol suggested he move toward the hatch: the young man of sixteen accepted without hesitation. After a period of probation to the rectory, so Joseph entered the Cistercian Abbey of St. Mary of the Desert (diocese of Toulouse, France) 5 December 1894. The novice was then the Father Andr? Malet. He knew perceive the needs of souls and responding humanely. From the first meeting he showed his benevolence: ""Have confidence! I will help you to love Jesus. "" As for the brothers of the monastery, they soon began to appreciate the newcomer: Joseph was neither argued nor grumbled but always happy, always smiling. Often contemplate Jesus in his passion and on the cross, the young monk imbibed the love of Christ. The ""way of the Heart of Jesus"" taught him that Father Andre, is a constant call to live the present moment with patience, hope and love. Brother Marie-Joseph was aware of its shortcomings, its weakness. But he always had more on Jesus, his strength. It was not a supporter of half measures. He wanted to give himself completely to Christ. His motto testifies: ""All for Jesus, all through Mary."" It was thus admitted to pronounce his final vows on 24 May 1900, the feast of the Ascension. It was then preparing for the priesthood. Brother Marie-Joseph especially contemplated depending on the Eucharist. This was good for him and this living reality of Jesus the Savior fully given to men, the Heart pierced on the Cross and then tenderly those who come to him in confidence. However, theology courses given by an unsympathetic brother occasioned very painful affronts to the sensitivity of the young monk. Faced with the contradictions, he relied upon Christ present in the Eucharist, ""the only happiness of the earth"" and confided his suffering to Father Andr?, who lit up and comforted him. However passed her exams satisfactorily and had the great joy of being ordained a priest on October 12, 1902. However, it was found that he was suffering from tuberculosis. The damage was very advanced. The young priest had not revealed his suffering until he could no longer hide: why complain, he who meditated the Savior of the Cross? Despite a family for seven weeks required by the abbot, his strength declined increasingly. On his return to the monastery, was soon sent to the infirmary, another opportunity to offer to Christ and the Church, his physical suffering increasingly intolerable, aggravated by neglect of his nurse. More than ever, Father Andr? listened, advised him and supported him. He said: ""When I can no longer say Mass, Jesus can take me from this world."" June 17, 1903, in the morning, after Communion, Father Marie-Joseph joined forever Christ Jesus. sometimes emphasized the banality of this short life: sixteen discrete Casseneuil years and nine years in the closure of a monastery, doing simple things: prayer, study, work. Simple things, but he knew how to live in an extraordinary way; small actions, but performed with limitless generosity. Christ had put in his mind, clear as spring water, the belief that God alone is the supreme happiness, that his kingdom is like a hidden treasure and a precious pearl. The message of Father Marie-Joseph is very present in a world of mistrust, often with despair but thirsting for love and tenderness, his life may be an answer, especially for young people seeking meaning in their lives. Marie-Joseph was a teenager with no relief and no value in the eyes of men. It is the success of his life to the overwhelming encounter of Jesus. He was able to make its sequel in a community of brothers, with the support of a spiritual father, both witness of Christ and able to accommodate and understand. It is for small and humble a magnificent example. It shows how to live, day after day, for Christ with love, energy and loyalty, accepting to be helped by a brother, a sister, experienced, able to lead them in the footsteps of Jesus. Breaking Marie-Joseph was beatified Oct. 3, 2004, by John Paul II (>>> Homily of Pope) along: Peter Vigne, Anne Catherine Emmerich, Maria Ludovica De Angelis, Charles of Austria. These were the last beatification of John Paul II (Karol J?zef Wojtyla, 1978-2005). Main source: vatican.va ( ""gpm Rev. x.""). John Paul II - extract the last homily for beatification. 3 Octonre 2004 3. Brother Joseph-Marie always put his trust in God, in contemplation of the mystery of the Passion and in union with Christ present in the Eucharist. It permeated so the love of God, yielding to Him, ""the only happiness of the earth,"" and detaching from worldly goods in the silence of the Trappists. In the midst of trials, his eyes fixed on Christ, he offered his sufferings for the Lord and for the Church. May our contemporaries, especially contemplatives and the sick, discover following his example the mystery of prayer, which raises the world to God and gives strength in trials! ?

Liver cancer Being overweight at 18 to 20 years-old may signal that a man is headed for severe liver disease decades later, according to a large, long-term study from Sweden. Researchers followed more than 44,000 men enlisted for military service in 1969 and 1970, and found those who were overweight as young men were 64% more likely to have serious liver problems and liver-related deaths in the next 40 years compared to normal weight counterparts. ?Most likely, these teens already had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) at the start of the study, or developed it down the road,? says lead author Dr Hannes Hagstrom of the Center for Digestive Diseases at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. ?We know that some persons with NAFLD do develop severe liver disease.? The researchers used national records on 44,248 Swedish men who joined military service, which requires a full physical exam, and tracked their health outcomes in medical registries up to 2009. By that time, 393 men had been diagnosed with severe liver disease, including reduced liver function, cirrhosis or liver-related death. Those who were overweight as teens were at the greatest risk, even after the analysis accounted for alcohol and tobacco use, according to the report in Journal Of Hepatology . About 7% of the men had been overweight in their youth, meaning they had a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 29.9. BMI is a measure of weight relative to height, and the range between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal. BMI of 30 or above is considered obese. Men who were overweight in their late teens and early 20s are 64% more likely to get liver disease. Photo: AFP/Shutterstock The highest risk for severe liver disease later on in life was alcohol consumption of more than 3.5 bottles of wine per week, Hagstr?m noted. ?However, it is already known that alcohol causes liver disease,? he says. ?What?s new here is that being overweight/obese was associated with an increased risk independent of how much alcohol these young men were drinking. ?Other significant risk factors were smoking, use of narcotics, self-rated health, cardiovascular fitness and high blood pressure,? Hagstrom said. The results would likely have been similar for women but that?s not necessarily clear in this study, he says. A similar study of men conscripted into military service in Sweden, published in the European Heart Journal , found that young men at the high end of the normal BMI range may have a higher risk of heart failure later in life compared to their peers at the low end of normal BMI. ?Those in high normal range don?t need to be concerned because (heart failure) is still very rare,? says lead author Dr Annika Rosengren, professor of medicine at the Sahlgrenska Academy in Gothenburg. ?The absolute risk is still very low.? But in Sweden, heart failure is becoming more common among people younger than 45, and may continue to do so as overweight also increases, she says. Younger people with heart failure are frequently misdiagnosed as having asthma, since both can cause shortness of breath, she adds. ?There?s already an incentive to try to decrease the obesity epidemic, this is just another reason for doing it,? she said. ?

This fish is no doubt a very weird looking animal. It has long elaborate fins and venomous spines. The fins are covered in a zebra like pattern and the whole body is covered in red and white stripes. They only grow to about 12 to 15 inches long. They are very dangerous to humans. One sting could cause persistent, intense, throbbing, radiating, sharp pain at the site of envenomation, tingling sensations, sweatiness, and blistering. In really bad cases it can cause systemic repercussions including headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, delirium, seizures, paralysis of limbs, a rise or drop in blood pressure, respiratory distress, heart complications including congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, tremors, muscle weakness, and loss of consciousness. 6. They live mostly in coral area. They mostly between Africa and Australia and between Japan and Australia. This map shows it all. 7. They reproduce externally and they have some sort of mating process. It is not well documented so no one knows what it really is. But the it will make larvae which brings us to the next section. 8. The larvae are planktonic and they will leave the water column after 25 to 40 days, at a size of 10-12 mm in length. 9. They eat mostly small fish, crabs, and shrimp. 10. Fun Fact: To kill their prey, they will often spread its feathery pectoral fins and herd small fish into a confined space where it can more easily swallow them.

Kaiser Permanente Logo. OAKLAND, Calif. , March 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Heart failure patients who had early follow-up with general medicine or cardiology providers within seven days of being discharged from the hospital had a lower chance of being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days, according to a study from Kaiser Permanente published today in the journal Medical Care. Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization among adults 65 years and older and more than 1 million patients are hospitalized due to heart failure each year. In addition, among Medicare patients hospitalized for heart failure, more than 20 percent are readmitted within 30 days. Although improving the efficiency and effectiveness of care after hospitalization has been a major focus, there is little evidence from large-scale studies in clinical practice regarding the impact of particular interventions in improving patient outcomes. ""Our study showed that the timing of follow-up after hospitalization for heart failure is an important factor. Early follow-up within seven days, even with a telephone call, was associated with lower risk of readmission, whereas follow-up after seven days was not associated with this benefit,"" said lead author Keane K. Lee, MD, MS , a cardiologist and research scientist with Kaiser Permanente in Northern California . The study population consisted of 11,985 adults who were hospitalized for heart failure between 2006 and 2013, and who were discharged to home without hospice care. There were 1,587 cases of patients being readmitted to the hospital within the first 30 days after discharge who were then carefully matched with 7,935 patients who were not readmitted based on having the same follow-up time as the corresponding case. Early follow-up within one week was independently associated with 19 percent lower odds of readmission, while follow-up after one week was not associated with lower readmission risk. Approximately 70 percent of the patients had either a clinic visit or a telephone call within 30 days of hospital discharge, with about 50 percent having contact within the first seven days. The majority ? 84 percent ? of the follow-up contacts were clinic visits, while the other 16 percent were telephone calls. While all clinic visits were with physicians, it is important to note that 45 percent of the telephone calls were made by non-physician providers who were trained to follow an outpatient heart failure treatment protocol. ""These data suggest that health systems can implement different methods of systematic, early patient contact to improve transitional care and, ultimately, clinical outcomes,"" Dr. Lee noted. ""Once the patient is back home, a phone call within a few days with either a physician or non-physician care team member may be more practical to implement by many health care delivery systems compared with clinic visits for all patients."" Another enabling factor, according to senior author Alan S. Go, MD , chief of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Conditions at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research , is the integration of care among providers ? internal medicine, family medicine and cardiology ? made possible by the organization's coordinated approach to health care combined with its comprehensive electronic medical record system across inpatient and outpatient settings. ""Heart failure poses a substantial health and economic burden nationally and is expected to grow significantly in the next several decades,"" Dr. Go said . ""Our results imply that clinicians may be able to leverage the increasing integration occurring in health care to improve the effectiveness of transitional care and reduce hospital readmissions in high-risk populations.""

Like the BBC?s other popular science-fiction series Doctor Who, Blake?s Seven was sometimes derided for its special effects, but its premise was ground-breaking and disturbing and its outlook on life and the future of mankind almost entirely bleak. It was set in a future dominated by a merciless authoritarian government, run by a sadist called Servalan, and there were no heroes and very rarely happy endings. In the first episode, in which the population of earth is living in a drugged-up stupor, Gareth Thomas?s character Blake is framed for child abuse before escaping and teaming up with a line-up of thieves, killers and chancers. Thomas appeared in the first two series of the show in 1978 and 1979, but from the start struggled to cope with theatre colleagues telling him he was wasting his talent on a silly science-fiction series and by the start of the third series he was gone, leaving the lead role to be taken by Paul Darrow?s Avon, who arguably was the more interesting character anyway. Thomas?s struggle with the success of Blake?s Seven ? which was conceived by the creator of the Daleks Terry Nation and at its peak was watched by 10million viewers a week ? was perhaps understandable as he had won considerable acclaim for his serious stage work. For the Royal Shakespeare Company, he was Orsino in Twelfth Night, Cassio in Othello and Mat Burke in Anna Christie by Eugene O?Neill; he also worked for the English Shakespeare Company. Away from Blake?s Seven, he also had success in other television series. In 1972 he was nominated for a television Bafta for his performance in the BBC Play for Today, Stocker?s Copper, and he was nominated again for his role as a Welsh hill farmer in BBC One?s Morgan?s Boy in 1984. He was born in Wales in 1945 and trained at Rada before making his acting debut in 1965. He started winning small parts on television, and before long was appearing in well-known series such as The Avengers, Z Cars and Coronation Street. The year before Blake?s Seven, he appeared as Adam Brake, an astrophysicist who brings his son to the strange village of Milbury to study standing stones in the eerie BBC children?s drama The Children Of The Stone. Thomas?s other television credits include London?s Burning, Heartbeat and Midsomer Murders; he also reprised his role as Blake in the final episode of Blake?s Seven in 1981 - an episode which lived up to all its earlier promise by appearing to kill off every one of the central characters including Blake. In 2006, he made a brief return to the science-fiction genre when he appeared in the Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood; he also returned to his role as Blake again in 2012 in the audio series Blake?s 7: The Liberator Chronicles. For two decades, Thomas and his wife lived in the Borders on the banks of the Tweed. ""There came a point in our lives when my wife Linda and I just had to get out of London,"" he said. ""We looked first at Wales, but at that time prices there were beyond us, and there was a lot of resentment about secondhome owners."" Thomas had spent a few years in Edinburgh as a child when his father was sent there for work, so he felt a natural affinity with Scotland. ""We cast around for somewhere to live and decided that the Borders would be nice, and as soon as we saw this house we fell in love."" He sold the house in 2009, with a heavy heart, and had in recent years been living in Surrey. Thomas, who died of heart failure, is survived by his wife Linda. Share:",

Angkor Elephant Co. owner Oan Kiri said Tuesday his remaining elephants will work 2 1/2 hours in the morning and about two hours in the late afternoon, an hour less than previously. He said he decided to reduce their work after a female named Sambo died Friday after carrying some tourists. He said veterinarians blamed the death on heart failure from stress triggered by the temperature, which has pushed past 38 C (100 F) in recent days. Kiri said Sambo, who was buried Friday night at the complex, was between 40 and 45 years old, and had been in his care since 2001. He said he has eight elephants still working and five others that are too old to carry tourists. The elephant?s death triggered an outpouring of grief and criticism on social media in Cambodia and elsewhere. A petition was posted on the website change.org addressed to the Apsara Authority, the organization managing the Angkor archaeological site, calling for the end of elephant riding there. ?A cruel tourist attraction that is proven to be harmful to elephants, and can only damage the tourism industry of Cambodia, must finally come to an end,? it says. ?There is no such thing as cruelty free elephant rides,? it says. ?Tourists may think that riding an elephant on holiday does not cause harm - you often can?t see the cruelty - it?s hidden from view. What you don?t realize is that a ?once in a lifetime? or ?bucket list? item for you, means a lifetime of misery for wild animals.? Domesticated elephants used to be employed in large numbers for logging in Southeast Asia but mechanization and deforestation pushed most of them out of that role, and they are now often found at tourist attractions.

Dr Klaus Witte, from the School of Medicine and Consultant Cardiologist at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, led the study, known as VINDICATE. He said: ?This is a significant breakthrough for patients. It is the first evidence that vitamin D3 can improve heart function of people with heart muscle weakness ? known as heart failure. These findings could make a significant difference to the care of heart failure patients.? Vitamin D3 can be boosted by exposure to sunlight, but heart failure patients are often deficient in it even during the summer because older people make less vitamin D3 in response to sunlight than younger people. Vitamin D3 production in the skin is also reduced by sunscreen. The study, which was funded by the Medical Research Council, involved more than 160 patients from Leeds who were already being treated for their heart failure using proven treatments including beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors and pacemakers. Participants were asked to take vitamin D3 or a dummy (placebo) tablet for one year. Those patients who took vitamin D3 experienced an improvement in heart function which was not seen in those who took a placebo. Changes in heart function were measured by cardiac ultrasound. Heart specialists measure heart function by taking an ultrasound scan of the heart (known as an echocardiogram) and measuring how much blood pumps from the heart with each heartbeat, known as ejection fraction. The ejection fraction of a healthy person is usually between 60% and 70%. In heart failure patients, the ejection fraction is often significantly impaired ? in the patients enrolled into the VINDICATE study the average ejection fraction was 26%. In the 80 patients who took Vitamin D3, the heart?s pumping function improved from 26% to 34%. In the others, who took placebo, there was no change in cardiac function. This means that for some heart disease patients, taking vitamin D3 regularly may lessen the need for them to be fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), a device which detects dangerous irregular heart rhythms and can shock the heart to restore a normal rhythm. ?ICDs are expensive and involve an operation? said Dr Witte. ?If we can avoid an ICD implant in just a few patients, then that is a boost to patients and the NHS as a whole.? One key aspect of this study is that the researchers avoided using a calcium-based supplement, as calcium can cause further problems for heart failure patients. The findings from the VINDICATE study will be presented at the American College of Cardiology 65th Annual Scientific Session & Expo in Chicago on April 4. Heart failure affects about 900,000 people in the UK and more than 23 million worldwide. The condition can affect people of all ages, but it is more common in older people ? more than half of all people globally with heart failure are over the age of 75. ### Further information Dr Klaus Witte is available for interview.

Although, there are many drugs which can be prescribed from your doctor if you have this problem, most importantly, they can be also found in out mother nature. When you start to feel bloated, for no apparent reason, most likely its origin has something to do with some degree of fluid retention, a condition that can be dangerous, especially for the cardiovascular system. The difficulties to drain and mobilize the body fluids may be the result of a high sodium diet, hormonal issues, genetic factors or generally inappropriate food intake. Most common reasons for body fluid retention are: Chronic Liver Failure: Also called cirrhosis, in the most cases caused by abuse of alcohol is followed by edema. The body can?t produce enough proteins which hold the fluid in the circular system and that?s the main reason for edema in this disease. Chronic Heart Failure: When the heart muscle is damaged, blood can?t be pumped forward, so retrogressively it stays in the peripheral tissue, causing edema. Renal Failure: Acute or chronic, renal failure is always followed by edema. In most cases of acute renal failure immediate hospital treatment is needed, so our remedies work better for chronic disease (which is much more common). Fortunately, there are several natural diuretics which can help you combat this condition and prevent to become a major problem or interfere main body functions such as metabolism. 1. Fennel It is a wild Mediterranean plant with so many health benefits, no matter you take it as food, seasoning or tea. Fennel is a powerful diuretic, which is its major benefit, but besides removing excess fluid in the body, also has the power to regulate various digestive problems . 2.

It is estimated that 85% of the pineapple is water, which makes this fruit to has a very few calories; however, in turn it is a rich source of fiber, vitamin C and bromelain, all essential to fight fluid body retention. Because pineapple has a significant amount of potassium, an important mineral for sodium balance in the body and, in turn,stimulates the elimination of excess liquids from the body and improves the functioning of various vital organs . 4. Cherry Cherries are composed 70% water and have large amounts of B vitamins and also have a small amount magnesium, an essential mineral for our mood. As a source of potassium, the tails of this fruit are consider as natural diuretic for a long time.These provide significant amounts of flavonoids, antioxidants essential to facilitate the removal of water accumulated in the body. 5. Melon It is one of the most refreshing fruit because of its high water content (about 90%), but is also a source of vitamins, fiber and other important compounds that help eliminate fluids retained in the body. It is high in beta-carotene, antioxidant that prevent premature aging by preventing oxidative damage. 6. Chestnut Also called bitter chestnut, is a plant valued for its ability to improve the problem with varicose veins, hemorrhoids and phlebitis. As a diuretic, has a significant amount of flavonoids such as quercetin and rutin. These antioxidants stimulate the kidney to remove fluids . 7. Onion This vegetable is a source of minerals and trace elements such as calcium, magnesium, chlorine, cobalt, iron, potassium; plus vitamins A, B, C and E. Because contains 91% water, it is included in foods with diuretic action. Regular onion consumption, especially in their raw state, could activate kidney function to drain fluids more easily and thus prevent various diseases. Source:http://essentialhealthadvisor.com/",

When older people develop atrial fibrillation ? the most common type of irregular heartbeat ? it accelerates age-related declines in walking speed, strength, balance and other aspects of physical performance, according to new research in Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology, an American Heart Association journal. ?Particularly in older adults, we need to be mindful that the effects of atrial fibrillation (AFib or AF) go beyond increasing the risk of heart failure and stroke. We learned from this study that older adults with AFib are especially vulnerable to losing strength, balance, gait speed and coordination,? said Jared W. Magnani, M.D., Ms.C., lead author of the study and assistant professor of medicine at Boston University. In atrial fibrillation, the heart?s two small upper chambers (atria) beat irregularly and too fast, which may increase the risk of stroke, heart failure and other conditions. The risk rises with age. The researchers examined physical performance at ages 70, 74, 78, and 82 in 2,753participants (52 percent women, 41 percent African American) in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) study, a long-term investigation of aging-related health outcomes in Medicare recipients. At the beginning of the study, all of the participants were able to live independently. Comparing four-year changes in physical performance between participants recently diagnosed with AFib and those without, researchers found: Overall participants? physical performance declined with age, as expected; Participants diagnosed with AFib had a significantly greater decline in physical performance tests of balance, grip strength, how far a person could walk in two minutes, and the time needed to walk 400 meters (one lap around a standard track); Overall, participants with AFib completed the 400 meter walk an average of 20 seconds slower than those without AFib; The excess decline in physical performance in people with AFib was equivalent to an extra four years of aging; and Participants diagnosed with AFib declined more swiftly on each individual element of the test. ?Small declines in physical performance in older adults may have big consequences. The declines that we observed in participants with AFib are associated with increased frailty, which can result in loss of independence, decreased mobility, poorer quality of life, institutionalization and death,? Magnani said. Because the study enrolled only adults living independently, the results may not apply to older adults with greater cognitive or physical limitations. In addition, these results do not prove a direct cause-and-effect link between AFib and declining physical performance. ?There may be other factors, such as inflammation or accelerated muscle loss, that contribute to both increased risk of AFib and declining physical performance,? Magnani said. Co-authors are Na Wang, M.A.; Emelia J. Benjamin, M.D., Sc.M.; Melissa E. Garcia, M.P.H.; Douglas C. Bauer, M.D., Javed Butler, M.D.; Patrick T.

Not so fast.,"In rosuvastatin should we trust? People love the idea of preventive medicine. Preventing a disease, before it occurs, seems intuitively obvious. But when it comes to taking medicine to prevent a disease before it occurs, people tend to be much less comfortable. Not only are there the concerns about the ?medicalization? of healthy people, there are good questions about benefits, risks, and costs. Cardiovascular disease will kill many of us, so there?s been decades of research studying how to prevent that first heart attack or stroke. But even if you?re born with good genes and do everything possible to prevent heart disease (e.g., don?t smoke, exercise regularly, eat a health diet, moderate your alcohol, and keep your weight down) you?re still at risk of heart disease. And if you have one or more risk factors for disease, your lifetime risk goes up dramatically. Once you?ve had your first heart attack or stroke, the effectiveness of medical therapy is is clear. Drug therapy with medication like the ?statins? class of cholesterol-lowering drugs reduces deaths from cardiovascular disease. Given their unambiguous effectiveness, and the high likelihood that many of us will eventually have cardiovascular disease of some sort, the idea of ?pre-treating? otherwise-healthy people with drug therapy to possibly prevent that first event has been held out as a potential public health strategy. There?s new evidence that tests this hypothesis, and the results are surprising. One polypill to medicate them all? Preventing a disease before it occurs is called primary prevention. So-called ?lifestyle? approaches to primary prevention of cardiovascular disease are always the preferred approach: Changing behaviors may be low cost, are simple and can be safe. Smoking control efforts are probably the best example of such an approach ? reduce population levels of smoking, and you?ll see decreases in cardiovascular disease. Medications have been proposed as a secondary approach to disease prevention. The polypill concept has been around for some time. The idea is to bundle one or more low-dose medications into a single pill, with the objective of changing lifetime risk factors. In someone that?s otherwise well, convincing them to take multiple medications, daily, for a lifetime is not likely to be acceptable to many. The polypill could theoretically prevent cardiovascular disease through multiple methods (e.g., by targeting blood pressure and/or blood lipids), and (it?s hoped) reduce overall risks. One of the key ideas of the polypill concept is that it should not require close monitoring that is burdensome to patients and physicians. The patient should be able to take it daily and essentially go about their life as they always have. The more monitoring, and the greater the side effects, the lower the likelihood that anyone is going to be willing to take any medication for a lifetime, especially when they?re not actually sick yet. If we were going to build a polypill, we?d probably look for drugs with a track record of reducing deaths in cardiovascular disease. Drug like aspirin (ASA), the statins, beta-blockers, and hypertension drugs like ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs] would be likely candidates, as they reduce the risk of death in people who have already had their first heart attack or stroke. Last week there was a widely-reported study of a polypill published. The trial, called ?HOPE-3? examined the use of statins and blood pressure drugs to prevent heart disease. This massive study of 12,705 people was co-sponsored by a pharmaceutical manufacturer (Astrazeneca, makers of Crestor) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the primary government funder of health research in Canada. What did the HOPE-3 trial try to answer? HOPE-3 was a clinical trial designed to test the real-world effectiveness of a polypill. It studied a diverse population (29% Chinese, 29% Hispanic, 20% white, 20% South Asian or other Asian, 2% black and 2% ?other?.) This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomized 12,705 people into one of four groups: rosuvastatin 10mg+placebo, rosuvastatin 10mg+candesartan 16mg & hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 10mg, candesartan & HCTZ + placebo, or placebo+placebo. This slide, via the investigators, illustrates: This design allowed the individual evaluation of the cholesterol-lowering ?statin? drug, the blood pressure drugs, and the combination of three drugs. The trial was designed to mimic ?real life? as much as possible. Entry in the trial wasn?t based on blood pressure or lipids. There were no dose adjustments after you started the trial. Men had to be aged 55 years of age or older, and women, 65 years of age or older. Participants had to be free of cardiovascular disease but have at least on risk factor (besides their age) such as: an increased waist-to-hip ratio smoker low HDL (the ?good? cholesterol in the blood) dysglycemia (abnormal blood sugar levels) mild kidney dysfunction a family history of heart disase You were excluded from the study if you had clear cardiovascular disease already, if there were medical reasons you couldn?t take the drugs, or if you already had kidney dysfunction or low blood pressure causing symptoms. The study took place in 28 countries ? but not the United States, interestingly. The first coprimary outcome was a composite of death due to cardiovascular disease, heart attacks and strokes. The secondary primary endpoint added resuscitated cardiac arrest, heart failure, and revascularization to the first outcome. Because of the 2?2 design, there are three trials published, and they?re currently available free from the New England Journal of Medicine: Cholesterol Lowering in Intermediate-Risk Persons without Cardiovascular Disease (Lonn et al.) Blood Pressure Lowering in Intermediate-Risk Persons without Cardiovascular Disease (Yusef et al.) Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Lowering in Intermediate-Risk Persons without Cardiovascular Disease (Yusef et al.) Before getting to the results, I want to look at the adherence. Specifically, how many stayed on therapy? Primary prevention is treatment when you?re not ill, so there?s likely to be little real-world acceptance of any medication that people don?t stick with, especially when the treatment is for life. Somewhat surprisingly, for all the complaints that you may hear about the side effects of drugs, these treatments were very well tolerated, with little difference from placebo. Again, a slide from the trial group illustrates: While more people taking statins had muscle pain or weakness (5.8% vs. 4.7%), (classical statin side effects), there was no difference in discontinuation rates for this reason. Overall, the drug therapies were well tolerated, and the results show that more people stayed on triple drug therapy than those on a double placebo. One notable area where there was an excess of harms was in surgery for cataracts, where those taking statins had more surgery than those on placebo (3.8% vs. 3.1%). Does HOPE-3 give hope? On to the results, and this is where the study gets really interesting. There are three papers here and I?m not going to recite all the findings. I?ll focus just on the primary endpoint, and you can look at the PDFs above for the others. Treatment with a statin reduced cardiovascular events by a relative 24% with an absolute reduction of 1.1%. Overall, the anti-hypertensives did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular events at all ? but there were differences depending on whether or not you had hypertension when you entered the trial. Combined statin + antihypertensive treatment was no better than statin alone. And in all three active treatment groups, there were no differences in ?all cause? mortality (i.e., death for any reason). The study was most clear when it comes to primary prevention with statins: Rosuvastain offers meaningful benefits to those at intermediate risk of cardiovascular disease. There were fewer deaths and fewer strokes. This finding was independent of the cholesterol levels when patient started the trial. You ?set it and forget it?, and the strategy largely worked. Importantly, the results show the benefits of using statins based on on risk factors for disease, rather than the traditional approach of looking at lipid levels to guide decisions. What about blood pressure control? The third of patients with the highest levels of blood pressure did benefit from taking the dual drug therapy. In the middle third, there was no benefit. And in the bottom third, blood pressure lowering caused harm. Some of the criticisms raised have included the low doses of the medication used, the duration of the trial, or the choice to use hydrochlorothiazide instead of chlorthalidone, a similar drug that has better evidence of benefit. It could be a combination of factors. The takeaway from this trial is that (unlike what we learned with statins and cholesterol) if there?s no high blood pressure, then you shouldn?t take medication to lower your blood pressure. In patients with high blood pressure, already on medication, and at intermediate risk of cardiovascular disease, then adding a statin is an option that may be worth considering, as it will add meaningful (though small) benefits over lowering blood pressure alone. Put statins in the drinking water? One of the key results from this study is that while statins offer real benefits, those benefits are, from a population perspective, modest. If statins provide a 1% absolute benefit over 5 years, then we must treat 100 people for five years to benefit one person. I calculated the cost in Canada to be about $135 per year for 10mg a day of generic rosuvastatin. I understand that the same drug and dose in the United States, where there?s no generic available, will cost about $3600 per year. Using the Canadian costs, that means it will cost approximately $67,500 to prevent one major cardiovascular event. It?s estimated that three-quarters of men over the age of 55 and women over the age of 60 could be eligible for statins based on this data. While statins are not tremendously expensive, they are not free, and a decision to put millions on statins means resources not spent in other areas ? potentially other measures that improve overall live expectancy, such as focusing on the social determinants of health. Primary prevention with statins is lifelong therapy. Before undertaking it, one needs to consider the expected benefits (they are real, but modest), and the potential for harms and side effects (relatively small, but not zero). It?s possible (though not proven) that the lifetime benefits of statins may be larger, as the follow-up in this trial was just over 5 years. Perhaps more than any other type of medical treatment, primary prevention mandates a close consideration and respect for a patient?s own preferences. Some may be willing to take medication to reduce the likelihood that they will have a cardiovascular event. Others in the exact same circumstances may opt not to. There is not right or wrong answer. With HOPE-3, we now have good data to inform those discussions. Statins for everyone? Not so fast. Scott Gavura",

In a drug safety communication issued yesterday, the FDA indicates that the makers of Invokana, Invokamet, Farxiga and Xigduo XR will be required to add stronger label warnings about the risk of kidney damage. The warning comes after more than 100 adverse event reports involving patients who suffered acute kidney injury, which may cause hospitalization or potentially lead to kidney failure and death. Invokana (canagliflozin) is a Johnson & Johnson drug that was just introduced in March 2013, as the first member of a new class of diabetes drugs known as sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Farxiga (dapagliflozin) was introduced by Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca in 2014, as the second drug in this class. Invokamet and Xigduo are combination treatments that contain the active ingredients of Invokana and Farxiga, respectively, together with the older diabetes drug metformin. The FDA is warning patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms of kidney injury from Invokana and Farxiga, which can include decreased urine and swelling of legs or feet. ?A search of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from March 29, 2013, to October 19, 2015, identified 101 cases of acute kidney injury with sufficient detail to confirm the diagnosis and demonstrate a temporal relationship with canagliflozin (73 patients) and dapagliflozin (28 patients),? the FDA indicates. ?Hospitalization for evaluation and management of acute kidney injury was necessary in 96 of the 101 cases, and 22 cases involved admission to an intensive care unit.? The FDA notes that there were at least four deaths, two of which were heart-related, and 15 patients had to undergo dialysis due to kidney failure following Invokana or Farxiga use. Kidney Risks with Invokana and Farxiga Concerns about the risk of kidney problems from Invokana and Farxiga are not new, however, as the drugs work in a unique way by impacting the normal function of the kidneys. In May 2015, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) highlighted concerns about the risk of kidney failure associated with the drug after reviewing adverse event reports submitted to the FDA during the first year Invokana was on the market. The ISMP noted at that time that the potential safety signals involving kidney toxicity raise questions about whether the potential Invokana risks may actually outweigh the benefits provided by the diabetes drug. During the first year Invokana was on the market, ISMP highlighted 457 serious adverse event reports submitted to the FDA involving complications from Invokana. These adverse event reports typically only account for a small portion of the total problems associated with prescription medications on the market. Many of the reported Invokana problems involved kidney failure, kidney impairment or problems with kidney stones, urinary tract infections, dehydration, hypersensitivity and abnormal weight loss. Looking at reports to the FDA?s adverse event reporting system, the ISMP found that Invokana received more serious adverse event reports than 92% of the other drugs regularly monitored by the group. While the FDA only notes 101 reports in the warning issued this week, they may have used more stringent filtering requirements to determine which cases of acute kidney injury are likely to be linked to the medications. In addition, the FDA also noted that it is very likely that there are more cases that have gone unreported. The ISMP report also covered a much wider array of potentially kidney-related problems. The FDA notes that in about half of the cases it observed, acute kidney injury occurred within a month of starting Invokana or Farxiga treatment, and patients who discontinued using them showed signs of improvement. In addition to announcing that new Invokana and Farxga warnings will be required, the agency also urged doctors to be aware of factors that may increase the risk of kidney injury, such as hypovolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, and taking certain other medications, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) like Aleve and Motrin. The FDA also urged doctors to monitor patients? kidney functions and immediately remove them from the drugs and begin treatment at the first signs of kidney injury. Invokana and Farxiga Lawsuits The warning comes as a growing number of Invokana lawsuits, Invokamet lawsuits, Farxiga lawsuits and Xigduo lawsuits are being pursued by individuals throughout the U.S., each involving allegations that the manufacturers introduced the new diabetes treatments without adequately researching the potential side effects or providing proper warnings for consumers and the medical community. Kidney damage is not the only safety problem linked to these two drugs since they hit the market. The FDA has also launched investigations into other potential side effects of Invokana, Farxiga and other SGLT2 inhibitors, including a risk that users may develop diabetic ketoacidosis, kidney infections, bone fractures and amputations of the limbs. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) from Invokana and Farxiga involves a dangerous build up of acid in the blood, which may result in hospitalization or death. Late last year, the FDA required new Invokana warnings about ketoacidosis in December 2015, urging users to stop taking the drug and seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms like abdominal pain, fatigue, nausea, respiratory problems or vomiting. In September 2015, the FDA required new Invokana bone fracture warnings, indicating that the drug may also lead to decreased bone density. Earlier this month the FDA released a new Invokana safety warning, indicating that it may increase the risk of leg, foot, and toe amputations. However, the investigation into those potential side effects are ongoing. Although the medications have only been on the market for a few years, it is expected that hundreds, if not thousands, of product liability lawsuits may be filed over the new generation diabetes drugs in the coming months, as Invokana injury lawyers continue to review claims for individuals throughout the United States.

I got deathly sick in 2014 (almost died twice) with ARDS, spent 44 days in the hospital (30 days in ICU).  I came out with an even weaker heart.  My ejection fraction (pumping function) was, at one point, 15%.  Normal EF is 55-70%.  My current EF is 31%.  I had a pacemaker placed on 1/7/16, just to have it taken out on 2/26/16 due to a staph infection.  I am currently wearing an external defibrillator and will have my pacemaker put back in on August 19.  I have 10 scars on my upper body from my illness and pacemaker insertion/removal and will have at least one more scar come next month.    If you looked at me, you wouldn't know I have had heart disease almost my entire life.  Heart disease is invisible.  It doesn't care who you are or how healthy you think you are.  Some people are in heart failure and do not know it; they experience no symptoms. Do not take your heart for granted.  Get checked, especially if you have a family  history of heart disease.",

One of them is Taurine which is an amino acid. The Japanese have a life expectancy that is among the highest in the world. In fact, Okinawa, Japan?s famous ?Island of Longevity,? likely has the world?s highest percentage of people over 100 years old.1 Undoubtedly, there are many factors that play into the life spans of the longest-living populations, but evidence shows that they all have one thing in common: high dietary intake of an amino acid called taurine.2 The connection between taurine and a long life is so strong that researchers have dubbed taurine, ?The nutritional factor for the longevity of the Japanese.?3 Taurine promotes cardiovascular health, insulin sensitivity, electrolyte balance, hearing function, and immune modulation. In animal research, taurine protected against heart failure, reducing mortality by nearly 80%.4 Its benefits are so broad and extensive that scientists have described taurine as ?a wonder molecule.?5 Taurine is found abundantly in healthy bodies.6 However, certain diets, particularly vegetarian or vegan diets, lack adequate amounts of taurine.7,8 Disease states?including liver, kidney, or heart failure, diabetes, and cancer?can all cause a deficiency in taurine.9-11 And aging bodies often cannot internally produce an optimal amount of taurine, making supplementation vital.12 That?s why those interested in longevity should consider this vital and super low-cost nutrient. In this article, you?ll learn how boosting taurine levels can contribute to better cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurologic health. http://www.lifeextension.com/m...s-of-taurine/page-01 Also another supplement that slows down aging is AMPK. The notion that we ?die of old age? is a common and misleading myth of modern medicine. We die not of old age, but of cumulative failures within our cellular machinery. These failures should not be thought of as inevitable breakdowns, but instead as reversible elements of aging. One such reversible factor is a cellular enzyme called AMPK. No matter which organ system or underlying disease is involved, if you trace the pathological process far enough back, you will likely encounter a problem related to insufficient AMPK activity. This is good news for people who believe in significantly extending their life spans. That?s because a growing body of evidence suggests that boosting AMPK activity can prevent, and even reverse,1-4 life-shortening effects of aging. This includes disorders as disparate as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, liver and kidney failure, neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer?s), cancers, and more.5 In fact, scientists are beginning to refer to AMPK as literally a suppressor of aging itself.6 Substantial evidence indicates that restoring AMPK activity not only increases longevity, but works to fight the symptoms of aging in individual body systems. In this article, we?ll take a closer look at AMPK, what it does, and how its activity level changes with advancing age and unhealthy lifestyles. We?ll then examine evidence show?ing that restoring AMPK activity can increase healthy longevity. http://www.lifeextension.com/M...PK-and-Aging/Page-01 41",

Doctors in China have performed the first successful open heart surgery using a 3D-printed heart model to save a nine-month-old baby suffering from a severe heart defect. The boy, who weighed 5.6kg before surgery, was experiencing shortness of breath after birth and was diagnosed with Congenital Heart Defect (CHD). The surgery performed in the northeast Jilin Province was the first open heart surgery performed using 3D printing technology through which a full-sized heart replica modeled the boy?s cardiac structure and helped the doctors plan the operation, state-run Xinhua news agency reported Thursday. Sponsored ads ?With the model, we were able to know precisely where and how we should cut, and how big the incision should be. And with such a thorough plan, we spent only half the time we had expected to complete the surgery,? Zhang Xueqin, the baby?s surgeon and director of the pediatric cardiac surgery center at the People?s Hospital of Jilin said. The operation took place on March 11, and the infant has already been transferred to a general ward and is recovering. ?The defect was very rare and complicated,? Zhang said. The young patient suffered from ?total pulmonary venous anomalous drainage? ? which means all four of his pulmonary veins were malpositioned. He also had an atrial septal defect, causing blood to flow between the upper chambers of the heart. ALSO READ: Heres how a 3D printer saved a newborn babys life ?He was taken to the hospital and was critically ill with heart failure and severe pneumonia, because the boy is so young and small, it was difficult to develop the best surgery plan using just an ultrasound examination, he said.

A spin class to maintain a trim figure, jogging to feel fit and healthy. But now, scientists have revealed that regular activity could also be used as a treatment for chronic health conditions. Typically, doctors prescribe drugs or surgery for heart disease, low back pain, diabetes and other chronic illnesses. Yet, experts are now urging medical professionals to instead prescribe exercise to help alleviate symptoms associated with those problems. Study author Dr Tammy Hoffmann, of Bond University, said: ?Many doctors and their patients aren?t aware that exercise is a treatment for these chronic conditions and can provide as much benefit as drugs or surgery, typically with fewer harms.? Scientists revealed doctors are under-prescribing exercise as treatment for chronic health conditions - even though exercise often has the same benefits as surgery and drugs, with less health risks Many people suffering from chronic health conditions - which also include knee osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and more - would benefit from exercise. Yet, the study found that exercise is often under-prescribed in favour of pharmaceutical or surgical solutions. RELATED ARTICLES Share this article Share Physicians and patients lack awareness of the effectiveness of different types of exercise, the study determined. Additionally, poor descriptions of exercises in studies and a lack of training for health care practitioners may also play a role in the under-prescription. Dr Hoffmann said: ?Unless clinicians can access sufficient details about exercise interventions to prescribe them, they either guess at how to use them or do not use them at all. Exercise can be used to alleviate symptoms of a number of chronic health problems, including heart disease, diabetes and more ?Even when a family physician may not be involved in delivering the exercise intervention, they should know the main elements of an evidence-based exercise intervention so they can discuss with patients and refer appropriately.? The review, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, revealed certain exercises that would be beneficial by disease type. Some of the exercises could be prescribed by family physicians ? while others need referrals to doctors with specific exercise therapy expertise. For patients suffering osteoarthritis of the knee or hip, the study recommends exercises that focus on muscle strengthening, aerobic and range-of-motion. Those exercises help alleviate pain and improve function. Meanwhile, for those with low back pain, the experts suggest they undergo individually supervised exercise sessions with a physiotherapist for eight to 12 weeks, as well as partaking in home-based exercises. And, for people at risk of falls, supervised group or individual exercises by a physiotherapist or doctor could help improve balance, strength and coordination. Exercises for patients with diabetes, chronic fatigue syndrome, heart disease and heart failure should be prescribed by doctors with specialized training, the study revealed. The study authors said: ?Exercise is an effective but neglected treatment for many chronic conditions. ?However, similar to surgery, exercise is not a single entity but must be tailored to the condition.? Yet, the author noted that the exercises must be implemented in a manner consistent with how they were used in trials ? the same intensity and duration, and with the same components. Otherwise, they warn, the exercises may not have the intended effects ? and may not lead to the desired outcomes. Share or comment on this article MOST WATCHED NEWS VIDEOS",

Based on recent reports, we have revised the warnings in the drug labels to include information about acute kidney injury and added recommendations to minimize this risk. Patients should seek medical attention immediately if they experience signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury. This is a serious condition in which the kidneys suddenly stop working, causing dangerous levels of wastes to build up in the body. Signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury may include decreased urine or swelling in the legs or feet. Patients should not stop taking their medicine without first talking to their health care professionals. Doing so can lead to uncontrolled blood sugar levels that can be harmful. Health care professionals should consider factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury prior to starting them on canagliflozin or dapagliflozin. These include decreased blood volume; chronic kidney insufficiency; congestive heart failure; and taking other medications such as diuretics, blood pressure medicines called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Assess kidney function prior to starting canagliflozin or dapagliflozin and monitor periodically thereafter. If acute kidney injury occurs, promptly discontinue the drug and treat the kidney impairment. Canagliflozin and dapagliflozin are prescription medicines used with diet and exercise to help lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes. They belong to a class of drugs called sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Canagliflozin and dapagliflozin lower blood sugar by causing the kidneys to remove sugar from the body through the urine. Untreated, type 2 diabetes can lead to serious problems, including blindness, nerve and kidney damage, and heart disease. From March 2013, when canagliflozin was approved, to October 2015, FDA received reports of 101 confirmable cases* of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, with canagliflozin or dapagliflozin use (see Data Summary). This number includes only reports submitted to FDA, so there are likely additional cases about which we are unaware. In approximately half of the cases, the events of acute kidney injury occurred within 1 month of starting the drug, and most patients improved after stopping it. Some cases occurred in patients who were younger than 65 years. Some patients were dehydrated, had low blood pressure, or were taking other medicines that can affect the kidneys. We urge health care professionals and patients to report side effects involving canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or other medicines to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the ?Contact FDA? box at the bottom of the page. http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm505860.htm",

The upregulation of both GRK2 and GRK5, the predominant GRKs expressed in the heart, has been shown in failing human myocardium. While the canonical role of GRKs is to desensitize receptors via phosphorylation, it has been demonstrated that GRK5, unlike GRK2, can reside in the nucleus of cardiomyocytes and exert GPCR-independent effects that promote maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (HF). We find that cardiac-specific NFAT luciferase reporter mice crossed with mice that overexpress wild-type GRK5 in a cardiomyocyte specific manner exhibit an increase in NFAT activity both in the basal state as well as after the hypertrophic stressors transaortic constriction and phenylephrine administration. Complimentary to this, GRK5  mice exhibit less NFAT transcriptional activity after left ventricular pressure-overload as shown by the expression of the NFAT target gene RCAN. Importantly, loss of NFATc3 expression protected GRK5 over-expressing mice from the exaggerated hypertrophy and early progression to HF seen after TAC. Molecular studies suggest that GRK5 acts in concert with NFAT to increase hypertrophic gene transcription in the nucleus and this is a kinase-independent action of GRK5 that may involve its known property of DNA binding. This study provides another non-canonical role for GRK5 in activating the hypertrophic NFAT pathway in cardiomyocytes and may serve as a building block for the development of novel therapeutics which are capable of inhibiting and reversing the progression of HF.^ Subject Area Molecular biology Jonathan E Hullmann, ""Protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 exacerbates cardiac pathology through activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells pathway"" (January 1, 2016).

The trial found improved outcomes in high-risk patients treated to a target of of 120 mm Hg instead of 140 mm Hg. Although the 25% reduction in relative risk in the primary composite outcome ""sounds impressive,"" Eduardo Ortiz, MD , and Paul James, MD , wrote that this ""corresponds to a decrease in event rates from 6.8% to 5.2% over 3.2 years, or an absolute risk reduction of 1.6%."" They estimated that treating 1,000 people for 3.2 years with more aggressive treatment would result, on average, in a beneficial effect in 16 persons, serious harm in 22, and no benefit or harm in 962. They write: ""Patients may believe that it is worthwhile to aim for lower BPs if they hear that receiving 3 drugs every day for more than 3 years might reduce their risk for cardiovascular events by 25%. However, after learning that their likelihood of absolute benefit is only 1.6%, with a greater likelihood of serious harm, their enthusiasm for more medications may diminish."" Given the low overall rate of events in SPRINT, ""statistically significant differences may not necessarily correspond to differences that patients or their physicians consider clinically significant."" Ortiz and James also criticized the way the NIH promoted the study, emphasizing the benefits of aggressive therapy while ignoring its harms. This, they said, raises the specter of overtreatment. They do concede that SPRINT should be incorporated into clinical practice, but the ""process should carefully consider the overall body of evidence; potential harms, burdens, and costs of more aggressive treatment; and patient preferences."" They recommend a nuanced response to SPRINT as opposed to a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach. A more aggressive approach may be warranted in a 55-year-old high-risk patient without other conditions. More caution is warranted for a 79-year old patients with multiple comorbid conditions who is already taking two or three antihypertensive drugs. SPRINT, they concluded, did not provide ""convincing evidence that large segments of the population should be treated with additional drugs to a systolic BP goal less than 120 mm Hg, especially when the adverse events, costs, and burden of such treatment are considered."" Additional Commentary Christie Ballantyne, MD , of Baylor College of Medicine, offered stronger support for SPRINT than other physicians asked to comment. He said that although he agreed that ""'one size does not fit all' and that one must look at both risks and benefits,"" he thought the editorial did not provide a ""fair and even"" view of the trial. ""For example, if you are an older individual, one of the major concerns would be an increase in injurious falls. Although the authors of the commentary state that this is increased, in regards to serious adverse events, there were actually fewer injurious falls"" and a similar number of emergency room visits. ""Why not let the individual who is 79 years old make the decision with real information, show the events that are avoided such as death and heart failure and show the increase in side effects which most patients would not consider as serious?"" he asks. Further, Ballantyne pointed out, the absolute reduction in risk is actually greater in older patients. ""I do not understand why the authors of this paper suggest that we selectively ignore the much greater absolute benefit in the elderly and the greater relative risk reduction. How can the results of this study be used to say we should be aggressive in the young when they had the least benefit?"" Others contacted by MedPage Today, were likely to side with the editorial writers. Lee Green, MD , of University of Alberta, said that he generally agreed with the editorialists and that he shares ""their concern about the hype exceeding the reality."" Lee was lightly more encouraged by the risk-benefit analysis of the trial, as the serious harms in the trial had ""less impact on patients than the benefits (stroke, MI)."" He added that ""for a very limited subset of properly chosen patients,"" aggressive therapy as in SPRINT ""is a reasonable, though by no means compelling, option for a small benefit at the risk of a lot of side effects."" Marc Itskowitz, MD , of Temple University, said it was an ""important editorial."" ""Many people do not understand the difference between relative and absolute risk reduction. I remain concerned about the potential risks of over treating hypertension,"" he said. ""We need to apply the results of SPRINT very selectively."" Albert Levy, MD , a primary care physician in New York City, said that he ""started to be more aggressive with my patients"" when SPRINT first came out."" But, he said, the Annals editorial is ""timely and welcome."" I have found many of my elderly patients do feel better on a little elevated blood pressure rather than with hypotensive symptoms."" And Franz Messerli, MD , of Mt. Sinai, and Sripal Bangalore, MD , of NYU Langone Medical Center, said that there was no reason to rush to embrace SPRINT: ""A simple but inescapable truth of medicine is that all patients are physiologically, psychologically, pathologically, culturally, and genetically different. Accordingly there never will be one best way to diagnose and treat many medical disorders, including hypertension. To lower systolic pressure of all hypertensive patients uniformly to 120 mm Hg or below clearly has to be considered absurd, regardless of the SPRINT results. As Ortiz and James eloquently state: 'Some patients and their physicians may believe that the benefit (of going to 120 mmHg) is worth the additional effort, risks, and costs of taking more medications, whereas others may not'. We can only hope that despite (or even because of) SPRINT physicians will continue to treat patients and not blood pressure numbers only.""",

J Cardiol. 2016 Mar 3; Authors: Goldsmith SR Abstract Conventional therapies for acute decongestion have yielded uniformly poor results in patients with acute heart failure (AHF). The failure of current strategies may be due to advanced disease in hospitalized patients, incomplete therapy, inherent limitations to existing therapy, or some combination of all three factors. Loop diuretics are the mainstay of current therapy and are in theory not ideal since while producing immediate intravascular volume reduction and relief of symptoms they activate neurohormonal forces that are deleterious to both the heart and the kidney. Ultrafiltration is an alternative to loop diuretics but has not proved advantageous in the setting of renal dysfunction, and if not carefully applied may also aggravate neurohormonal imbalance. In theory decongestive therapy for AHF should remove large volumes of fluid quickly and safely and improve symptoms, particularly dyspnea, without aggravating renal dysfunction or causing neurohormonal activation. Several studies have now suggested that the use of aquaretics such as antagonists to the V2 receptor for arginine vasopressin may be useful as adjunctive therapy in AHF, particularly when renal dysfunction and/or hyponatremia are present. These agents leverage osmotic forces to produce tissue decongestion while causing a water diuresis. They do not adversely affect renal function or neurohormonal balance. Building on the current base of knowledge about outcomes in AHF together with the only study of vasopressin antagonists as short-term monotherapy in chronic heart failure, it would be reasonable to design a trial in AHF in which the use of loop diuretics was minimized in favor of these agents.

If not, you should be June 17, From your grandmother?s pearl necklace to your great-grandfather?s pocket watch, there are countless family heirlooms passed down from generations, but none are as old as your family?s gene pool. Genetics are what give you your father?s chin or your mother?s eyes, but sometimes you pick up some unwanted gifts, such as their blood pressure problems or diabetes. Health care providers often ask questions about your family history of certain illnesses, and Karen Landry, Ph.D., assistant professor at the Texas A&M Health Science College of Nursing, breaks down why?and which conditions are most likely to be affected by your family?s genes. Cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and high cholesterol According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the United States. ?Heart disease? is a wide umbrella term, with a great variation of the conditions that fit under it, such as heart failure, heart attack, stroke and coronary artery disease. Because high blood pressure and high cholesterol can lead to these conditions, several risk factors are avoidable by maintaining a healthy lifestyle. While genetics may play a factor with heart disease, it is also likely that people with a family history of heart disease share common environments and other potential factors that increase their risk. ?We don?t always know the extent that family history plays in heart disease,? Landry said. ?We try to encourage healthy lifestyles as ways to prevent or minimize the effects of these conditions.? High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a very common condition, affecting about 80 million Americans. High blood pressure could lead to health problems such as heart disease, congestive heart failure and heart attack or stroke. There are many other factors that may lead to high blood pressure, such as being overweight, smoking or having diabetes. It is possible to manage your high blood pressure through lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy diet, reducing sodium intake, becoming physically active, reducing stress and taking medication. According to the CDC, 31 percent of adults have high cholesterol. Cholesterol, while not inherently bad, can lead to an increased chance of heart disease if not properly managed. ?Having high cholesterol or blood pressure can lead to future problems,? Landry said. ?If your family has a history of these conditions, you?re at greater risk and should work with your health care provider to keep them managed.? High cholesterol can be managed with healthier eating choices and exercise. A diet with high amounts of trans fat and saturated fat raises your low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ?bad? cholesterol. Eating more monounsaturated fats (including nuts, avocados, olive oil and fish) is important for keeping your cholesterol in check by raising your high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or ?good? cholesterol. Type 2 diabetes Diabetes, one of the most common diseases in the United States, is commonly linked to family history. Although both type 1 and type 2 diabetes genetics can be passed down, type 2 diabetes has a stronger link to family history. According to the American Diabetes Association , a child?s risk for getting diabetes is about 50 percent when both parents have type 2 diabetes, but even with this family history, the risk for developing type 2 diabetes can be lowered through a healthy lifestyle. For those who already have diabetes, keeping your condition under control is extremely important , as you can minimize symptoms and live an ordinary life. Mental Illness or addiction According to National Alliance on Mental Illness , approximately 4.2 percent of adults in the United States experience mental illness in a given year that substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities. A family history of mental illnesses or mood disorders, such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer?s and dementia, increases the chance of developing the disease. Mental illnesses and mood disorders are common among all groups of people, but typically develop in early adulthood. Along with genetics, environmental factors?such as stress or life events?can play a significant role on whether someone develops a disorder, or the severity of the illness. A Texas A&M College of Medicine study examined how alcohol affects neurons in the brain, possibly causing a craving for alcohol. According to the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence , genetics makes up 50 percent of the risk for alcohol and drug dependence, but, like many people who are genetically dispossessed to a condition, it doesn?t mean that they?ll develop it. Many outside factors can also lead to addiction, such as societal factors and exposure within the home or community. Cancer A few types of cancers ?such as breast, ovarian or colon?can have hereditary factors, but only a small proportion are associated with a family history. However, each family is different. For example, very large families may make the numbers seem greater than they are, and families with few women won?t show patterns of ovarian or breast cancer. If you have one elderly relative with breast or colon cancer, then it is more likely that the cancer is not hereditary. However, a large number of people with the same type or a related type of cancer, especially if they were diagnosed at a young age, may signal a problem. For many people with a family history of these conditions, medical providers may refer you to a specialist. ?Keeping track of family history is very important to getting optimal care from your health care provider,? Landry said. ?If you feel like you are at risk for these conditions, talk to your provider and make sure you are keeping up-to-date with your family history.? ? Dominic Hernandez",

Covadonga Diaz. Oviedo | dmredaccion@diariomedico.com | 20.06.2016 00:00 share Jose Luis Rodriguez Lambert, Cardiology Service HUCA. (Covadonga Diaz) The new guidelines in addressing heart failure reflected important changes both as a definition of the disease is referred to as in terms of treatment, with the establishment of LCZ696 (sacubitril) plus valsartan as second-line drugs in symptomatic despite treatment with beta blockers and ACE inhibitors or receptor antagonists, angiotensin II (ARA II), with a mortality reduction of 20 percent patients. Heart Failure Congress 2016, held in Oviedo during the XIII Meeting of the Heart Failure Section of the Spanish Society of Cardiology (SEC), has served to disseminate these guidelines, among other innovations. The US regulatory agency FDA approved the use of LCZ696 last year; European EMA did earlier this year, and is expected to fall forward to the approval of the Spanish Ministry of Health, according to Jose Luis Rodriguez Lambert, the Cardiology Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (HUCA) and president of the Section Heart failure of the SEC. One of the novelties of the guidelines is the establishment of a new classification of the disease, in which, besides the two traditional types of heart failure fraction preserved ejection (HFpEF) and depressed ejection fraction (HFrEF), appears an intermediate variant (HFmEF). In addition, it has begun working with a new algorithm, focused primarily on clinical and exploration and ""simplifying decision-making with these criteria, if perhaps supplemented with ultrasound"". According to the algorithm, the first-line treatment with beta blockers and ACE inhibitors or ARBs for all patients, and the addition of receptor antagonists of the mineralocorticoid if symptoms persist consolidates. LCZ696 as second-line therapy will add to the previous tripod, if patients continue symptomatic, ""given the success that has been shown and can be used in combination with ivabradine and resynchronization"". If necessary it will be used also to diuretics and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Thus, the LCZ696 reduced by up to 20 percent mortality and hospitalization of patients in the subgroup indicated: patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and period of open-label treatment, which tolerate ACE inhibitors "" and yet they still symptomatic, ""he stated Rodriguez Lambert. Resynchronization Another important issue that has been addressed in the congress is the most accurate subgroup of patients most likely to benefit from resynchronization, ""which is not indicated in patients with lower QRS of 120 milliseconds in the electrocardiogram and given identification the best results are achieved in patients with optimal medical treatment remain symptomatic and have left bundle branch block and QRS greater than 150 milliseconds ""He also has emphasized the importance of the multidisciplinary approach of heart failure,"" the most prevalent heart disease and in which primary care, internal medicine and nursing plays a fundamental role.

Front Page Article Today, there is only one class of antiviral medicines against herpesviruses***8212;a family of viruses that cause mononucleosis, herpes, and shingles, among other illnesses - meaning options for treating these infections are limited. If viruses become resistant to these frontline treatments, a growing problem particularly in clinical settings, there are no alternative drugs to serve as backup. In a search for new drugs to treat viral infections, scientists from the University of Utah School of Medicine found that a medicine routinely used to treat heart failure, spironolactone, has an unexpected ability to block infection by Epstein Barr virus (EBV), a herpesvirus that causes mono and is associated with several human cancers. They find that the drug's antiviral properties stem from its ability to block a key step in viral infection that is common to all herpesviruses. Spironolactone's target is distinct from that of existing drugs, revealing that it could be developed into a new class of anti-herpesvirus drug. ""It's remarkable that a drug we have used safely in the clinic for over 50 years is also an effective EBV inhibitor,"" says senior author Sankar Swaminathan, M.D., chief of infections disease at University of Utah Health Care and professor of internal medicine. ""It goes to show how basic research can reveal things we would never have found otherwise."" In collaboration with research assistant professor of internal medicine Dinesh Virma, Ph.D., and Jacob Thompson, he published the study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Swaminathan's team uncovered spironolactone's antiviral properties in a screen to identify drugs that work through a mechanism that is different from that of existing anti-herpesvirus drugs. Currently available drugs block a middle step of the viral infection cycle by inhibiting virus' ability to replicate DNA. They found that like these drugs, spironolactone can block EBV replication in cells, but it does so by targeting the so-called SM protein, required for a late step in the infection cycle. Importantly, spironolactone's ability to block viral infection appears to be independent from its ability to treat heart failure. Previous studies showed that the drug treats heart failure through a different, metabolic mechanism. This study demonstrates that a drug similar to spironolactone shares its ability to treat heart failure but not its antiviral properties. Together the results suggest the two mechanisms are separable. ""We think there is great potential to modify this molecule so that it can work as an antiviral without having undesired side effects,"" explains Swaminathan. Spironolactone could be developed as a new medicine against EBV, a common and dangerous infection among transplant and other immunocompromised patients. But because all herpesviruses depend on SM-like proteins to spread infection, the work also has broader implications. Spironolactone could be a template for a new class of drug directed against all herpesviruses. ""We have found a new therapeutic target for herpesviruses,"" says Swaminathan. ""We think it can be developed it into a new class of antiviral drugs to help overcome the problem of drug resistant infections.""

Calculation of the sample size was based on mortality from cardiovascular causes. We estimated that we would need to follow approximately 8000 patients for 34 months, with 1229 deaths from cardiovascular causes, to provide the study with a power of 80% to detect a relative reduction of 15% in the risk of death from cardiovascular causes in the LCZ696 group, at an overall two-sided alpha level of 0.05. On the basis of these calculations, we estimated that the primary end point would occur in 2410 patients, which would provide a power of 97% to detect a 15% reduction in the risk of this outcome. Death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure (the primary end point) occurred in 914 patients (21.8%) in the LCZ696 group and 1117 patients (26.5%) in the enalapril group (hazard ratio in the LCZ696 group, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.87; P<0.001 [exact P=4.0?10?7]) (Figure 2AFigure 2Kaplan?Meier Curves for Key Study Outcomes, According to Study Group. and Table 2Table 2Primary and Secondary Outcomes.).

I am a 38 year male born (and living) in Yorkshire, England. Just over 20 years ago, aged 17, I was diagnosed with Wegener's Granulomatosis. It was this disease that severely damaged my kidneys. I was placed on hemodialysis 3 times a week and after only about a month (plus a multitude of drugs and chemotherapy) my kidneys regained a good deal of function and I did not need further dialysis. In the 20+ years since, I have had relapses/flares of Wegener's Granulomatosis and each time it has done further permanent damage to my kidneys. The most recent relapse has left me with eGFR of 18% with the occasional result dropping to 14%. Therefore I am now one relapse/flare or even bad cold/virus away from needing dialysis. As my kidney function stabilises (sometimes for quite a few years) then drops off suddenly, there is no predication as to the exact time I need a transplant/dialysis. My hope was to have a living donor transplant before I need dialysis, but as mentioned, I don't know exactly when that will be. I did think having a transplant early would be better than waiting until I was on dialysis as I had read that the most succesful transplants are ones performed before the need of dialysis. But I recently found out that if the transplant fails, my remaining kidney function would immediately drop and a failed transplant would equal immediate permanent dialysis. As I may be lucky enough to have a few years left of barely adequate function I don't want to lose it. My health is certainly poor enough that I'm showing symptoms of severe kidney failure, but because I have many other illnesses (heart failure, haemochromatosis, lung problems, platelet dysfunction, immature red blood cells, etc, etc) that have similar symptoms, it is hard to predict if dialysis would make me feel much better.",

His unexpected early death is a shocker. Brian Asawa, Celebrated Countertenor and Pathbreaker at the Met, Dies at 49 By MARGALIT FOX APRIL 23, 2016 Brian Asawa, one of the world?s foremost countertenors, whose repertoire ran from the Renaissance to Rorem, died on Monday in Mission Hills, Calif. He was 49. The cause was heart failure after a long illness, his sister, Cindy Rouze, said. Of Japanese ancestry, Mr. Asawa was among the relatively few Asian-Americans to attain stardom in the world of classical singing. He appeared on the stages of the Metropolitan Opera, the Paris Opera, the Mostly Mozart Festival, Carnegie Hall and elsewhere. Countertenors are curious creatures: men with the approximate range of mezzo-sopranos. Mr. Asawa was one of only a handful of them to enjoy international renown. ?For so many years the countertenors were sounding like they were from outer space,? Peter Somogyi, a founding partner, with Mr. Asawa, of Asawa & Associates, a Los Angeles management concern representing singers and opera directors, said in an interview on Wednesday. ?It was such a hybrid voice type. And when Brian came along he just made it sound so fluid and effortless.? In 1991, Mr. Asawa became the first countertenor to win the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, the annual competition that is a steppingstone to a Met debut. ?I had entered the Met auditions for the sake of experience, with no thought of making it beyond the regional level,? Mr. Asawa told The New York Times in 1994. ?When I got the application, there wasn?t even a category for countertenor. When I won, I was really pleased, because it meant that the Met acknowledged the countertenor as a viable voice type.? At its best, the voice of a countertenor can be piquant, ethereal and haunting. At its worst, it can be thready and attenuated, hooting like a tin whistle, an appraisal with which countertenors of bygone days were often saddled. Though countertenors were legion in the Renaissance and Baroque eras, with John Dowland, Purcell and Handel writing for them, they had largely fallen out of favor by the 19th century. By the 20th, they were consigned almost entirely to the early-music pale. ?Bearded ladies,? members of the classical-music establishment sneeringly called them. Today, however, thanks to the exquisite voices of singers like Mr. Asawa and David Daniels ? and the eagerness of such singers to commission new work ? countertenors have embarked on a vigorous revival. Mr. Asawa, critics concurred, was neither thready nor hooty. He was widely praised for the size, richness, agility and silvery beauty of his voice, as well as for his superb musicianship, engaging stage presence and impeccable diction in a Babel of languages. ?In a remarkable recital on Monday night at the Walter Reade Theater, Brian Asawa showed the kind of pure, effortless countertenor voice that comes along only once in a long while,? Alex Ross wrote in The Times in January 1994. ?It is hard to convey the uncanny effect of his full, fluid, lustrous tone, poised in the extreme upper register without the slightest strain."" Mr. Asawa made his formal Met debut the next month, as the voice of Apollo in Benjamin Britten?s ?Death in Venice.? He returned to the Met in 1999 and 2000 ? the 19th- and early-20th-century fare to which the company traditionally inclines provides few roles for countertenors ? as Tolomeo in Handel?s ?Giulio Cesare.? Mr. Asawa was closely associated with the San Francisco Opera, where his roles included Oberon in Britten?s ?A Midsummer Night?s Dream.? He also sang with the Santa Fe Opera, the Houston Grand Opera and the Hamburg State Opera, and on a string of acclaimed recordings. All this was a far cry from the days when he was a young tenor and, by dint of singing to the redwoods in the forests of California, discovered his authentic voice. Brian Laurence Asawa was born on Oct. 1, 1966, in Fullerton, Calif., and reared in Los Angeles. His father, George, was a chemist; his mother, the former Fusako Yoshida, ran a hair salon. An aunt, Ruth Asawa, who died in 2013, was a noted sculptor. As a youth, Brian sang in his church choir and played the piano, cello and trombone. He entered the University of California, Santa Cruz, as a piano major and sang tenor in the university chorus. One day, walking home from a rehearsal, he made a remarkable discovery. ?On the way back to the dorms in the middle of the redwood forest, I would sing the soprano line of the choral music for fun in my falsetto voice,? Mr. Asawa told The Associated Press in 1999. ?I discovered I had a strong voice in that range.? To his voice teacher, Mr. Asawa gingerly broached the idea of becoming a countertenor. ?He could so easily have said: ?Dude! What voice is this??? Mr. Asawa recalled in a 2003 interview with The Seattle Times. ?But instead he was very encouraging.? There were few living role models for young countertenors then. But when it came to charting that vocal course, Mr. Asawa later said, he felt he possessed a staggering advantage. ?Heterosexual men don?t feel comfortable singing in a treble register because it?s not butch?, he told the magazine The Advocate in 1998. ?Gay men feel quite comfortable singing in their falsetto voices.? He transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles, where his voice teachers included Virginia Fox and Kari Windingstad. After earning his bachelor?s degree there, he began graduate studies in early-music performance at the University of Southern California, where he worked with the lutenist James Tyler. His singing career took off before he could finish his degree. Mr. Asawa?s marriage to Keith Fisher ended in divorce. A resident of Los Angeles, he is survived by his mother and sister. Though Mr. Asawa was best known as a Handel specialist, he cast a musical net that spanned centuries. He commissioned works from contemporary composers, among them Jake Heggie, whose song cycle for him, ?Encountertenor,? with lyrics by John Hall, includes the memorably titled ?The Trouble With Trebles in Trousers.? Mr. Asawa?s discography includes ?The Dark Is My Delight,? a collection of 16th-century songs with the lutenist David Tayler; ?More Than a Day: Music of Ned Rorem?; and ?Vocalise,? with the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields under Sir Neville Marriner. When introducing people to his recordings, Mr. Asawa ? whose speaking voice did not betray the heights he could scale as a singer ? often found himself having to do some explaining. ?When my friends listened to the ?Vocalise? record,? he told The A.P., ?they said: ?Who?s that woman? When are you coming on??? http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/arts/music/brian-asawa-celebrated-countertenor-and-pathbreaker-at-the-met-dies-at-49.html",

Andrew Jones, from Conneticut, first became unwell in 2012 after struggling to breathe during a run. He was horrified when two years later he started to cough up blood and developed a high fever. In hospital, doctors diagnosed the 26-year-old with cardiomyopathy - a hereditary disease of the heart muscle - and soon he became so weak he couldn't stand, walk or dress himself. A few months later, medics told if he didn't have a transplant immediately he would die. As there were no organs available, he was fitted with a pacemaker and an artificial heart - which he now carries around in a bag on his back. Despite his brush with death, he is now back to the gym and said he cries after workouts as he feels so 'thankful to be alive'. Recalling suffering from heart failure, Mr Jones said: 'It's something I would never want to wish upon my worst enemy. 'You can't breathe, you can't think, you don't eat and you don't sleep. He continued: 'Living with this disease put me in a pattern with depression and physical pain. 'I had to stop working because I wouldn't be able to stand for more than 10 minutes. 'I dreaded going to the kitchen because that meant that I had to go up and down my stairs. 'I couldn't even get dressed without panting and gasping for air my life was falling apart and I just wanted relief.' But since having the artificial heart implanted he has slowly recovered and is now back to training in the gym. His artificial heart has two tubes that exit the body and are connected to a machine he carries around in a bag. The machine delivers compressed air into the ventricles to allow blood to be pumped through the body.",

Yes, you burn more calories standing than you would parking it in a chair, but that requires standing for hours on end (and researchers found most people with sit-to-stand desks fail to do so). And yes, a sedentary lifestyle can increase your risk of heart failure and shorten your lifespan, but research has yet to show that standing at work actually changes those stats. The analysis isn't out to end the sitting vs. standing debate, but Jos Verbeek, M.D., Ph.D., a researcher at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health and one of the study's authors, told NPR that there are more effective ways to create a healthier work environment, such as putting the printer farther away from your desk or going to a bathroom on another floor. And if you really love your standing desk, there's no need to abandon it, especially if it makes you productive. You just shouldn't feel high and mighty when you see coworkers chilling in their chairs. (h/t NPR)",

Narrating what happened to The Nation, the trader said her son had fallen ill last Wednesday Feb. 3rd and was taken to General hospital where some drugs were given to him. She said her son felt better after taking the medications but suddenly became ill on Saturday and was rushed to Ayodele hospital where he was immediately placed on Oxygen. She said her baby died following a power outage which resulted in the oxygen mask not working. The bereaved mother said her cry for help when the power went off was not heeded by both the nurses and doctors as the power did not come on even after 30 minutes. ""When we got to the general hospital last Wednesday, we were told he should be admitted but there was no bed space. I bought the drug prescribed by the physician and my son?s temperature returned to normal. I was so shocked on Saturday morning when his temperature became high again. As my husband and I wanted to take him back to the general hospital, there was traffic gridlock so we resorted to Ayodele Hospital since it was in our neighbourhood,? she said. Temiloluwa said when they got to the hospital, they were asked to pay N5,000 for card ?My husband paid N2,000 and excused himself to use the Automated Teller Machine (ATM). Immediately my son was attended to. He was placed on drip and oxygen. Even when the doctor asked if he was convulsing, I told him he has never convulsed. Within few minutes, my son began to sweat and I felt he was getting better. The doctors also assured me he was going to be fine. As I sat beside him on his sick bed, there was power outage and I noticed the oxygen stopped moving. I ran out of the room to call for help but nobody answered me. I even went to knock the doctor?s door but no one was there. The nurses said they were going to put on the generator but it came on after 30 minutes. I removed the hose passed through his nose to aid breathing to allow breeze blow him. Before I removed it, he had already stretched his arms, I didn?t know he was about to leave me. It was later doctors came in, one of them placed his hands on my son?s chest but he was no more. I realised the owner of the hospital was just describing where the heart was to the doctor attending to my son. Before they put on the generator, it was my phone?s light I used to see how my son was doing. I have never attended the hospital before, even when I was pregnant, my friends advised me not to go there""she said The bereaved mother said when the family went to collect her son?s remains the next day February 7th, the hospital allegedly refused and demanded N40,000 before the body could be removed. ?When we got there, I was shocked to see my son?s body beside the hospital?s dust bin. Even when my husband shouted that his son be given to him, the hospital management called police officers from Oko-Oba division to take him away. It is unfair. I have not been able to sleep. I see my son wherever I go. I want to bury him. I just got married last year and he is my first child. At three months, Murewa already had two set of tooth. He was a cute gentle boy. Whenever I took him to the market, he understood I was busy. He never disturbed me. I didn?t give him any home medication. I was even meant to use the money I had on me to stock my shop but my son is priority. Immediately I noticed his temperature, I went to the general hospital where I spent almost the whole day. I need my son?s body.?she said The management of the hospital has however faulted claims by the mother that they seized the child's corpse for no reason. According to hospital?s administration manager, George Abayomi, the family has not been able to retrieve the corpse of their child because the father of the boy destroyed some of the hospital facilities following the death of his son. He also denied claims that the hospital did not put on their generator immediately power went off ?We have two standby generators in our premises; why should it take us 30 minutes to put on the generator. His parents brought him at the last minute. He died as a result of anaemia heart failure. When the father got aware of his son?s death, he began to destroy the hospital property and he couldn?t be restrained. He promised to burn down the hospital. After he left, he returned around 12:20am with a gallon of petrol which he sprinkled in the reception, it was when we couldn?t control him that we invited police officers from Oko-Oba division. He came this morning (yesterday) around 9am to take his son?s body but we told him he had an outstanding balance to pay. He has to pay the bill of the services rendered.

Traitel Endowed Chair of Physiology, will lead a study on a regulatory protein in heart muscle using a new $1.57 million, four-year grant from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Jin is the principal investigator of the project ?Regulation of Troponin I in Cardiac Adaptation and Failure.? Contraction of the cardiac muscle is the basis of heart function, and cardiac troponin I is a key regulatory protein in cardiac muscle. The Jin lab researches the regulation and function of myofilament and cytoskeleton proteins, using heart failure, myopathy and cell motility models. ?We are excited because this added support permits us to explore an exciting new area of heart failure research with a high translational potential,? Dr. Jin said. The team recently discovered that the N-terminal extension of cardiac troponin I can be removed by restrictive proteolysis in a normal heart and up-regulated in cardiac adaptation to hemodynamic stresses and heart failure. The N-terminal truncated cardiac troponin I facilitates the filling of heart chambers to increase cardiac output, suggesting an attractive new target for the treatment of heart failure, especially diastolic heart failure -- a major health challenge with no effective treatment, Dr. Jin said. ?Our research project combines the complementary expertise of several research laboratories to study the function and production of N-terminal truncated cardiac troponin I for the ultimate goal of translating this novel molecular mechanism into the development of a new treatment for diastolic heart failure,? he said. Heart failure is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality of heart diseases. Approximately 5 million people in the United States have it, with nearly 300,000 annual deaths, Dr. Jin said. More than 500,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. ?Despite continuing improvement in the treatment of heart diseases, heart failure remains a major medical challenge and an economical burden on health care. More effective treatments are urgently needed,? he said. The grant, R01-HL127691, is one of four the National Institutes of Health has awarded to faculty in the Department of Physiology for 2016 to date. Dr. Jin also is the principal of another NIH R01 grant on troponin mutations in nemaline myopathy; principal investigator and project director of the Detroit Cardiovascular Training Program, a NIH T32 training grant; and co-principal investigator of an NIH multi-PI R21 project on novel diagnosis of C. difficile infections.",

Los Angeles, CA (PRWEB) April 22, 2016 While bariatric surgery is generally considered an effective means of long-term weight loss for people with severe obesity, an article published April 14th on Orthopedics Today explains that its impact in terms of weight loss may also improve the outcomes of patients who need knee replacement surgery. The article states that, when considering the long-term health benefits associated with bariatric surgery, it may actually be a more cost-effective solution for patients with osteoarthritis who may be in need of a knee replacement while still severely obese, but who will very likely no longer need the intervention once their body mass has been significantly decreased. Commenting on this article, the Los Angeles based bariatric surgery clinic, Dr. Feiz & Associates, says that, for a considerable amount of people struggling with severe obesity, issues such as joint pain and osteoarthritis are just a few of the comorbidities that make living with severe obesity all the more harmful. Indeed, the clinic explains that patients who undergo weight loss surgery can expect an improvement or resolution in many obesity-related co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes, heart failure, hypertension, depression, sleep apnea, and more. Dr. Feiz & Associates explains that, because all of these health concerns are linked to obesity, that a major reduction in excess body weight can bring about massive quality of life benefits for a great many patients. The clinic points to bariatric surgery as an effective means of jumpstarting the weight loss journey for many people, with procedures such as the Lap Band and the gastric sleeve becoming two of the most common. The clinic explains them in detail: The Lap Band: Gastric binding is a procedure that reduces the stomach?s overall volume and capacity, which in turn reduces a patient?s appetite and tends to make the prospect of overeating uncomfortable and undesirable. A patient who elects the Lap Band can normally expect to have a few re-adjustment procedures to ensure that they meet their weight loss goals. New Jersey governor Chris Christie is a particularly well-known example of the Lap Band?s success, Dr. Feiz & Associates explains; the former presidential candidate successfully lost as much as 100 pounds after the procedure according to many reports. The gastric sleeve: The sleeve gastrectomy procedure has a two-fold effect. Firstly, it involves removing a large portion of the stomach tissue, which also reduces its capacity, allowing the patient to feel fuller faster than previously. Secondly, this removal also curbs the release of the hormone ghrelin, which is responsible for the all-too-common hunger pangs that induce many people to eat more than they intend to. Dr. Feiz & Associates explains that bariatric procedures such as the gastric sleeve and the Lap Band continue to help many a patient lose large amounts of excess body weight.

If you snore occasionally it is not a problem. Those who snore habitually may need medical assistance. Snoring is caused by obstruction in the air passage. The obstruction may be due to infection in the nostrils, poor tongue and throat muscle which may allow them to fall back into the airway and long soft palate. People whose snoring is caused by sleep apnea have a 40% higher risk of dying early. Snoring is related to sleep apnea. But not everyone who snores has sleep apnea, and not everyone who has sleep apnea snores. But how do you tell the difference. Those with sleep apnea are likely to suffer from extreme fatigue and sleepiness during the day. This will not be the case for just snoring. In sleep apnea you have one or more pauses in breathing or you may take shallow breaths while sleeping. Breathing pauses may last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour. Normal breathing then starts again. According to U.S. Department of Health & Human Service, untreated sleep apnea can: ? Increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, obesity, and diabetes. ? Increase the risk of, or worsen, heart failure ? Cause irregular heartbeats. ? Increase the chance of having work-related or driving accidents. Those who are overweight and smokers are likely to have sleep apnea, if they snore during sleep. Some lifestyle changes can help sleep apnea - exercising regularly, quitting smoking, avoiding sleeping pills, alcohol and sedatives, avoiding caffeine and heavy meals within two hours of going to bed and maintaining regular sleep hours. Sleep on your side and not on the back. Using a pillow keep your head up four to six inches high. Elevate your body from the waist up using a foam wedge or a special cervical pillow. Continuous Positive Airflow Pressure (CPAP) is most commonly used to treat moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. The CPAP machine is of the size of a tissue box provides constant air flow that keeps your breathing passages open when you are sleeping. You put on a mask at bedtime and switch on the machine and it will do the rest. You will feel the benefits immediately. Next morning you feel very relaxed and energetic. There is no more risk of sleep apnea. This non-invasive treatment is effective but patient non-compliance is high. The device is uncomfortable. The patient will have to use it throughout the night and every night for whole life. Because of this some patients prefer surgical treatment. It is only one time treatment. The downside of surgery is pain which may last for 2 to 3 weeks, infection, bleeding and problems in swallowing etc. In the end the surgery may not correct the problem. Many surgical treatments are also available to treat obstructive sleep apnea. They include reducing the soft tissues in the mouth as well as enlarging the skeletal framework of the jaw. Insertion of implants involves minimally invasive operation and helps in mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea condition.",

Hajjar, MD, Professor of Medicine and Director of the Cardiovascular Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The study was published online this week, and will appear in the May 3 issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC). http://www.medicilon.com/pharmacology/ Pharmacology models http://www.medicilon.com/pharmacology/Cancer-Xenograft-Models.shtml Cancer Xenograft Models http://www.medicilon.com/pharmacology/Metabolic-Disease-Models.shtml Metabolic Disease Models http://www.medicilon.com/pharmacology/Inflammation-Immunological-Disease-Models.shtml Inflammation and Immunological Disease Models http://www.medicilon.com/pharmacology/Neurological-Disorders-Models.shtml Neurological Disorders Models http://www.medicilon.com/pharmacology/Other-Disease-Models.shtml Other Disease Models Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, rapidly progressing disease that occurs when blood pressure is too high in vessels leading from the heart to the lungs. There is currently no cure for PAH, and about 50 percent of people who are diagnosed will die from the disease within five years. The high pressure is caused by abnormal remodeling of the lung blood vessels that sometimes leads to failure of the right ventricle and premature death. Thickening and narrowing of pulmonary vessels is seen with all types of pulmonary hypertension and is triggered by abnormal calcium levels within the vascular cells. The sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump (SERCA2a) regulates intracellular calcium in vascular cells and prevents them from proliferating in the vessel wall. ""There is considerable need for new treatments that improve functional capacity, symptoms, and survival,"" said Dr. Hajjar. ""This treatment with gene therapy offers a novel method of treating a deadly disease that disproportionately affects young adults and women,"" he said. Female patients make up about 72 percent of the total population of patients with PAH. ""The therapeutic potential of using gene therapy to treat pulmonary hypertension by delivery of aerosolized adeno-associated virus carrying SERCA2a to directly target vascular remodeling through the overexpression of the SERCA2a protein is very significant,"" said co-senior study author Jane A. Leopold, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. ""In addition, as other novel targets are identified by deep phenotyping of patients with pulmonary hypertension in the National Institutes of Health/National, Heart, Lung, & Blood Institute-funded Pulmonary Vascular Disease Phenomics (PVDOMICS) study, they may be viable candidates for aerosolized gene transfer using adeno-associated viral vectors."" There were two primary objectives for this study, which was conducted by Mount Sinai and research teams from Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston, MA, and Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III in Madrid, Spain. First, scientists wanted to learn if it is feasible to deliver a therapeutic gene called SERCA2a in aerosol form to damaged blood vessels of the lung using an engineered adeno-associated virus as a ""vector."" Second, they wanted to see if there was a sustained beneficial impact, and if the transferred genes effectively slowed or stopped the vascular changes in the airways that are the hallmark of PAH and other forms of pulmonary hypertension. Previously, the novel aerosol inhalation technique used to deliver the SERCA2a gene in this study had proven effective in a rodent model. However, the current study is the first to explore this approach in a large animal?specifically, a Yorkshire swine model that closely resembles PH in humans. In the study, 20 pigs were divided into two groups, half of which received the aerosolized viral vector carrying the SERCA2a gene and half a saline spray. Two months after the gene delivery, scientists performed tests to see if the new therapeutic genes were present and functioning in the vessels of the animals' lungs, and whether the transfer was producing the desired effects. When they examined the animals, they found that that heart and lung function had improved and abnormal cellular changes causing PH were reduced. ""I'm excited that there is a potential new treatment for patients with this deadly disease,"" Dr. Hajjar said. ""By tailoring the gene therapy, it looks like we can halt the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the blood vessels. This should help restore function and improve survival in human patients."" Dr. Hajjar said that additional animal studies focusing on long-term efficacy and safety are warranted before advancing this approach, known as airway gene delivery, to human clinical trials. That's because the current study involved a small number of animals, and they were assessed just eight weeks after gene delivery. Nevertheless, he said, airway gene delivery appears to modify fundamental pathophysiology, and therefore might offer therapeutic benefit to humans with a variety of pulmonary vascular diseases.",

Long before medicine was invented, herbalists still existed and this was the mode of treatment back then and people were doing fine especially since there were no lifestyle diseases that are claiming the lives of many every passing day. People from different background have always been known to possess different herbal techniques that they have passed from generation to generation and below is some of the common herbs that have been used over the years. Astragalus is a popular herb that was discovered by the Chinese people but has ever since circulated all over the world treating ailments like diabetes, kidney disorders and strengthening immune systems. Additionally, this herb has been known to boost ones stamina and enhancing endurance and can be ingested through soups or stews. Green tea is another popularly known brew, an antioxidant that has various health benefits among them being its ability to boost energies. Most people believe that it can be taken to fight drossiness when they are sleepy and have something important to work on. This is obviously due to the fact that it is a stimulant and a booster that comes in handy during these situations. Ashwagandha is an Indian herbal medication that has been proven to help in reducing stress, boosting the immune system and energy levels and more so preventing heart failures. As seen in most herbs, it should be taken during the day when ones is busy; otherwise, it may bring sleep disorders whereby one struggles to sleep when they are ready to go to sleep. Eleuthero is another natural supplement that helps in reducing inflammation, lessening fatigue, relieving pain, and enhancing the immune system. Its mostly taken in a drink such as tea and has been known to work by helping the body maximize the energies stored; in other words, it enhances efficiency which is the reason it is preferred by athletes as it serves their purpose by boosting endurance and their stamina, two important aspects in sports. As its known before taking any medication, consulting a certified physician is indispensable as it is the only way one can be sure they are putting their health at risk. Even more so, there are those that have medical conditions that may not go very well with the herb they are taking and therefore should consider doing some consultation first. Also, the supplements are known to boost ones energies and are recommended to be taken when one is busy and not when going to bed as this will not maximize their potential. In summary, all these and other natural supplements are beneficial to ones health as they help heal the body without any harmful side effects; people however ought to make certain that before they prescribe themselves these supplements, they seek consultation from a medical specialist in order to have a medical checkup and make sure they are not suffering from any disease as taking them may mask the side effects a ailments and realize them when its too late to treat them, especially since drossiness is a symptom to many ailments.

But due to time or training constraints, some still continue to use old methods of making orders. Here are a few tips for nurses to make sense of the medical chart and the orders in them: Know the Medical Chart Format Some hospitals use a different method of making patient notes, but majority of doctors use the SOAP format. Knowing the sections of the chart will help you deduce what the doctor is trying to do for the patient The ?S? portion on subjective complaints refers to the symptoms that patient?s experience. The ?O? portion on objective findings refers to results of physical examination or laboratories as noted by the doctor. The ?A? portion is the assessment or the doctor?s working diagnosis for the patient. The ?P? portion on plan refers to the doctor?s orders on next steps including further diagnostic tests, medications, procedures, and other instructions for carrying out. Know the Common Abbreviations Some items in the chart cannot be understood, not because of handwriting, but because doctors abbreviate terms or use old Latin medical phrases. The Institute of Safe Medication Practices summarized a list of commonly misunderstood medical orders that should be avoided (https://www.ismp.org/tools/errorproneabbreviations.pdf). But in case they are used, here are descriptions of the most common abbreviations seen in medical charts: Frequency od - once a day bid - twice a day tid - three times a day qid - four times a day hs - at bedtime prn - as needed q - every (ex: q15m is every 15 mins, qh is every hour) d/c - discontinue Laterality AD / OD - right ear / right eye AS / OS - left ear / left eye AU / OU - both ears / both eyes Descriptions with ?-x? sx - symptoms dx - diagnostics, or diagnosis bx - biopsy tx - treatment rx - medicines px - patient Other names PED - pediatric patient AP - attending physician Body parts heent - head, eyes, ears, nose, throat (also eent, ent) csf - cerebrospinal fluid abd - abdomen GB - gallblader KUB - kidney, ureter, bladder ing ? inquinal Physical exam tests or questions BP - blood pressure HR - heart rate RR - respiratory rate EBL - estimated blood loss I&O - input and output ROM - range of motion LMP - last menstrual period Laboratory tests CBC - complete blood count PC - platelet count UA - urinary exam SE - stool exam CXR - chest xray AFB smear - acid fast bacilli smear ABG - arterial blood gas C/S - culture and sensitivity ECG ? electrocardiogram Conditions UTI - urinary tract infection A/URTI - acute/upper respiratory tract infection CAP - community acquired pneumonia CA - cancer CAD - coronary artery disease CHF - congestive heart failure FBO - foreign body obstruction R/O - rule out (means a probable diagnosis, not yet certain) Procedures AP - appendectomy BKA - below knee amputation CPR - cardiopulmonary resuscitation I&D - incision and drainage Other instructions CBR - complete bed rest NPO - nothing per orem BRP - bathroom privileges DNR - do not resuscitate PT - physical therapy isol - isolation protocol vo - verbal order Know the common orders for a specific case Sometimes you can deduce the order from context clues. If the patient is suffering from pneumonia, then most likely antibiotics are given three times a day. If a diabetic patient is admitted for surgery, then pre-operatives laboratories are commonly comprehensive. If a patient is in critical condition in the ICU, then most likely monitoring is as often as every 15 minutes. Experience can also show you a doctor?s common patterns in treating their patients. Don?t be Afraid to Ask for Help But if you really can?t really understand the doctor?s orders, always ask for help. You can approach co-nurses or the actual doctor to help you understand what they want you to carry out. Never carry out an order that you are unsure of because this can be both harmful to the patient and the careers of yourself, the doctor, and the hospital. For cases like these, it is best to be safe than sorry.",

The blood thus circulated carries food and oxygen to the cells (so that they can function properly) and carries away carbon dioxide and waste materials. A very large number of people suffer from heart disease and millions of them die each year worldwide. There are many types of heart diseases that affect your heart. The various heart diseases include diseases of your blood vessels, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems heart infections and heart problems that you may have at the time of birth. Sometimes the term ""heart disease"" is often used interchangeably with ""cardiovascular disease."" Cardiovascular disease is caused by disorders of the heart and blood vessels, and includes coronary heart disease (CHD) cerebrovascular disease (stroke), raised blood pressure, peripheral artery disease, rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease and heart failure. Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death globally and more people die annually from cardiovascular diseases than from any other cause. Some of the common causes of cardiovascular disease are tobacco and excess alcohol use, physical inactivity, stress and an unhealthy diet. Common Cardiovascular Diseases CoronaryHeart Disease (CHD): This is also known as Ischaemic Heart Disease (IHD) or Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)and is the most common type of cardiovascular disease in many countries around the world. In simple, Coronary Heart Disease refers to problems with the circulation of blood to the heart muscle. The circulation of the blood may be affected due to one or more blockages in the coronary arteries. Coronary arteries are the vessels that deliver oxygen-rich blood to heart muscle. A partial blockage in the coronary arteries may cause symptoms such as chest pain (angina) and shortness of breath. A complete blockage of an artery may causedamage to the heart muscle tissuesand may lead to a heart attack. In some people there may be multiple blockages. Cerebrovascular Disease (Stroke): Just like heart muscle, your brain also needs a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to function properly. For this you should have an interrupted circulation of blood to the brain. In some people the circulation of blood in the blood vessels of the brain might get disturbed. Because of this the cells may start dyeing due to the lack of oxygen rich blood. Such a situation may cause a stroke. A stroke is an emergency medical condition since it may cause serious brain damage and possibly death if the treatment is delayed. The sooner you get the treatment for stroke lesser the damage is likely to occur. Peripheral Vascular Disease: In Peripheral Vascular Diseasethe blood circulation is affected due to blockage in the arteries to your limbs, primarily in the legs. If you have Peripheral Vascular Disease then you may have pain in the calves, thighs or hips especially when walking, running or climbing stairs.You may feel cramps, a dull pain or a sensation of heaviness in the muscles of your legs.Peripheral vascular disease is also known as Peripheral arterial disease. Cardiomyopathy: Cardiomyopathy refers to the diseases of the heart muscle where the heart muscle becomes enlarged, thick or rigid. If the cardiomyopathy worsens then the heart becomes weaker. In such a situation, the heart may not be able to properly pump blood through the body and maintain a normal electrical rhythm. This can lead to weakening of the heart orheart failure which in turnmay causefluid to build up in the lungs, ankles, feet, legs, or abdomen and in some cases it might also cause heart valve problems.There are different causes, signs and symptoms, and treatments available. Valvular Heart Disease: Valvular Heart Diseaseis the disease of the valves of the heart. Your heart is a pump that pumps blood through the circulatory system in your body. The blood carries all the vital things that help your body function.The direction of blood flow is controlled by a set of four valves. Each valve opens and closes once per heartbeat. The valvesplay a major role in helping the blood to flow into the main arteries in one direction and preventingthe regurgitation of blood in reverse direction. In case of Valvular Heart Disease, the heart valves become less effective in controlling the flow of blood. The valves may fail to close fully or leak or the outlet of the valve may become narrowed. The problems with the valves maylead to the reduction of the blood flow and an increase in the pressure on heart wall.It may also cause back pressure in the lungs or the peripheral tissues. Valvular Heart Disease cause significant reduction of effective blood circulation causing congestion of the lungs and peripheral tissues. It may also lead poor oxygen supply to the vital organs. Rheumatic Heart Disease: Rheumatic Heart Diseases are the heart disorders that can occur as a result of rheumatic fever. Rheumatic Heart Disease may cause damage to the heart valves. This may lead to a heart valve disorder.Rheumatic Heart Disease may affect heart valves during childhood and the actual heart problems may develop or may be seen in later years. In most of the cases the affected valves have to be replaced by a valve replacement surgery. Congenital Heart Disease: Congenital Heart Disease is the disease that arises due to the defect/s in the structure of the heart that is present at birth. These defects can be as simple as a small hole in one of the inner walls of the heart or they can be very complex which may seriously affect the flow of blood in heart and lungs. Some congenital heart problems may need surgical intervention and in some cases more than one operation may be required.",

Thank you for asking on HCM! Regarding your concern, I would explain that sinus drainage is not related to CHF. It may be just a chronic sinus infection or an allergic reaction. I would recommend performing some allergy tests and a sinus discharge bacterial culture to investigate for the possible causes.

My comments reflect recent experience with those clients and their interactions with the Agency. By-and-large a helpful, well written document. Thank you. Specific comments/requests for clarification: 272: ""In cases where training would be appropriate but is not expected to routinely or consistently occur, the HF study should evaluate the user interface in the absence of training."" Please describe what is or isn't acceptable to tell study participants about a product when evaluating products in the absence of training? For example, is it acceptable to provide information on the indications for use? Or that the product comes in multiple doses? That the product is used once a week? Or that the product is intended for use with children and adults? Patients would obtain some of this information through interactions with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist, independent of training. Please provide some guidance around what researchers can convey to study participants. When the Agency requests that an untrained arm be added to a study, what are the Agency's expectations around use of the instructions for use? For example, is it appropriate to direct users to review the labeling for a product in an untrained arm? If not, why not? What does the Agency hope to learn through this use case. Study design issues relating to untrained arms, how much background information or context to provide study participants, and whether it is or isn't appropriate to direct participants to review the product labeling, are the most problematic for sponsors. Please provide additional guidance in these areas. Both what the Agency is looking for, and why. 440:450. The guidance lists two groups of products for which HF data should be submitted - (1) products used outside the health care environment or by lay persons and (2) combination products having a device constituent part for which human factors data should be submitted. Please clarify (2). Is this a reference to the list of high priority devices for human factors review covered by the recent draft guidance from CDRH? 465. The example is odd given that the referenced product is used by patients. That fact alone would make it a product for which HF data is required. Yet the example suggests that data is required because the specific user characteristics (neuromuscular disorder, visual impairment) may affect safe use."

She tweets as @Trudy_Lieberman . Associate Editor Carolina Branson, PhD contributed significantly to the analysis. There were three ways news outlets could have responded to the Justice Department?s (DOJ) February announcement and its previous one last fall that revealed 508 of the nation?s hospitals in 43 states had been fined more than $280 million for implanting a cardiac device in 10,000 patients in violation of Medicare?s national coverage determination, potentially harming them and wasting billions of taxpayer dollars. They could have: Taken a pass. Published a piece that didn?t stray beyond the borders of the DOJ press release. Dug deeply into the disturbing medical and political issues raised by the government?s investigation. Given that hospitals now are big media advertisers in their communities and revered corporate citizens that generate oodles of coverage centering on ribbon-cutting ceremonies, announcements of new technology, and special events for sick kids, we wanted to know which options the media would choose when news about the local hospital is unfavorable. The huge DOJ suit, one of the largest ever in terms of the number of hospitals involved with far-reaching ramifications for patients, gave us a chance to find out. Media markets we examined We looked at a sample of coverage of the DOJ?s announcement in 18 states plus the District of Columbia examining print media and zeroing in on state and local coverage where hospital violations would be of most interest to readers. Our sample included hospitals with some of the biggest names in the business?the Cleveland Clinic, New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City, Robert Wood Johnson Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Scripps Health based in San Diego, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, as well as the giant Tennessee-based hospital systems like HCA with 42 hospitals involved, Community Health Systems with 31, and Health Management Associates with 27. We looked at two major news databases, Proquest Newsstand and Factiva, searching the names of 77 hospitals involved in the lawsuit. We also conducted another search of the all the major daily newspapers in the largest cities in states where a sample of hospitals we examined were located. These locations included New York City, New Jersey, San Diego, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Nashville, Memphis, Columbus, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Akron, and Atlanta. Our searches revealed scant coverage or none. In some locales like the San Diego area, home to Scripps Green Hospital and Scripps Memorial Hospital, teaching facilities based in LaJolla, we found no print coverage. Ditto for Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas or the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. Our New York search turned up no mention of New York-Presbyterian, a large TV advertiser . And the only coverage we saw for the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, which includes Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, was a brief, he said/she said story in Newsday that downplayed the significance of the settlement . In Tennessee with its mega, politically-connected hospital systems, our search of the largest newspapers turned up nothing about the settlement. Short, shallow stories The hospitals? reputations would hardly have been tarnished by the news coverage we did find. Mostly it regurgitated the Justice Department news release. For the most part stories were short, shallow, and failed to discuss the important implications of the government?s prosecution and why it deserved more probing treatment from the media. ?I?m not sure the significance of this investigation has been understood,? says Bryan Vroon, who represented the two whistleblowers?a registered cardiovascular nurse and a Medicare reimbursement consultant?in the false claims suit, the first national enforcement of a Medicare national coverage determination, which governs whether Medicare pays for services and procedures considered reasonable and necessary. ?This is a huge important issue for anyone of us,? Vroon told me. ?This number of hospitals don?t readily settle cases alleging violations of the False Claims Act unless there?s strong basis for the case.? (The False Claims Act, which dates back to the time of Abraham Lincoln, is the primary litigation tool the government uses to fight fraud.) The Department?s investigation, which looked at surgeries from 2003 through 2010, involved a device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, or ICD, which is implanted in patients who?ve had heart attacks or coronary bypass surgery. It?s designed to detect and treat life-threatening heart rhythms or fibrillations. The devices deliver a shock to the heart and help restore normal heart rhythm. Medicare?s national coverage determination says, however, that ICDs should not be used for heart attack patients until after a 40-day waiting period or after a 90-day period for patients who?ve had bypass surgery or angioplasty. During the waiting period patients must be given appropriate heart failure medications, which sometimes help improve heart function. Because that happens, patients may not need the ICD implant. Costs and harms from unnecessary surgeries ?Hospitals put ICDs in people outside the coverage guidelines who would not get a benefit and likely suffer,? says Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California San Francisco and editor of JAMA Internal Medicine , who reviewed cases for the Justice Department. ?It?s a big invasive procedure, and the guidelines are there to make sure that for people who are getting the procedure the benefits outweigh the harm.? Sanket Dhruva, a Yale Clinical Scholar in cardiology, told me not only are there are the usual risks associated with surgery, but the device is implanted for life and that always raises the possibility of infections. He says the device can also deliver painful shocks to the heart when the patient doesn?t need them. The cost of unnecessary surgery is also significant. Medicare?s payment is about $25,000. Redberg says she has seen bills that double that. Although some of the stories we examined (for example, this piece in The Ledger in Lakeland, FL) noted the waiting periods, they rarely mentioned the harms and risks of unnecessary implants. They did make clear that the hospitals accepted no liability for their actions, which is standard practice in false claims cases . And the stories did include statements from hospital PR officials who spun the DOJ?s action as a billing problem, a difficult interpretation of a complex regulation, or offered assurances to patients they were delivering good care no matter what the Justice Department said. It?s a shame the stories were not more thorough. Patients who read them could easily come away thinking this is no big deal. It?s just the government picking on our hospitals. Said Vroon, ?what bothers me about the spin is that the DOJ went to extreme effort to apply the science to determine if these surgeries were indicated. Medical science led this case.? ?Billing problems? and ?bad apples? Instead the public got these kinds of responses from the hospital spinmeisters: Emory Healthcare said the government ?focused on whether hospitals properly billed the ICDs, not on the quality of the patient care provided.? Mon General Hospital in Morgantown, WVA, claimed, ?this is a billing issue. This isn?t a medical mistake issue. We misinterpreted the guidelines and inappropriately billed.? Commenting on the fine paid by one of its hospitals in Pennsylvania, Community Health Systems framed the problem as ?a highly technical interpretation of a Medicare national coverage determination that was the subject of strong disagreement in the medical community.? The Cleveland Clinic defended the treatments it gave patients as ?life-saving and life extending,? adding it ? would provide the same treatment again if presented with the same illness. The only question was whether Medicare would reimburse part of the cost of the treatments. ? MedStar based in Columbia, MD, which had eight facilities involved in the DOJ settlement including the MedStar-Georgetown Medical Center and the Washington Hospital Center, said it stood by its ?solid record and long history of providing the highest quality heart care to residents of Maryland and Washington D.C. ? The Arkansas Heart Hospital claimed it had followed ?best clinical practices? but those practices had not been incorporated into Medicare?s payment guidelines at the time the procedures were performed.? In our sample, I saw only one statement that told patients they should talk to their doctors if they had concerns about the implants. That was California-based St. Joseph Health System. A Baltimore Sun piece was longer than most, but fell short when it seemed to side with the hospitals and didn?t discuss the harms and risks of the ICD procedure. It introduced the ?bad apple? defense for bad market behavior into the hospitals? narrative. The reporter reached out to a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins, which was not named in the lawsuit, who told her, ?No question there are some bad apples out there. But I don?t think these are all cases of health care fraud as the Department of Justice seems to imply.? He said there are a lot of ?gray zone? cases?times when it doesn?t make sense to wait and doctors want to implant both a pacemaker and a defibrillator immediately. What about the bad apples and the gray zones, I asked Redberg? ?This definitely was not one bad apple,? she said. As for the gray zones, ?I can tell you none of the cases the DOJ litigated were gray areas.? Four steps to securing Medicare reimbursement A few years ago health policy expert Murray Ross, a vice president for Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, spoke to journalism students in New York City and explained the politics of getting Medicare to cover new services and procedures. He laid out four steps sellers and providers use to stymie attempts to control the use of new machines, drugs, or procedures and to achieve their goal of getting Medicare to pay for them. First they persuade an insurer to pay for it. Once one does, others usually follow. If that fails, they try to get a national coverage determination from Medicare, which ensures payment although there may be restrictions as there are for ICDs. If a coverage determination is not forthcoming, they appeal to friendly members of Congress to send letters and make calls to Medicare officials. That usually does the trick. If it doesn?t, the lobbyists go to work ? perhaps adding an amendment to some ?must-have? legislation like a budget reconciliation bill that authorizes payment for the service. But what if the coverage determination that?s adopted isn?t to the liking of providers and sellers? The aftermath of the DOJ settlement shows there may be an additional route to take when things that appear to be settled aren?t working out for the industry. Vroon says the most revealing number of all is that since the beginning of the DOJ investigation in 2008, the number of surgeries to implant the device has dropped by about 28 percent, reaping a savings for Medicare of some $2 billion over the five years that followed. If Medicare saves more, doctors and hospitals get less. Blowing up the rules No wonder a nuclear option is emerging. Some medical specialty societies propose blowing up the national coverage determination and changing the rules ? arguing that the determination may be too restrictive when it comes to gray areas. In the last few years Viewpoint commentaries (see here and here ) appearing in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology have suggested the national coverage determination conflicts with practice guidelines that may be more ?flexible? and ?nimble.? In a Dear Colleague letter, Dr. John Day, president of the Heart Rhythm Society, a group representing professionals specializing in cardiac rhythm disorders, advised that his group and other specialty societies were working with Medicare ?to identify the appropriate time to reopen the existing national coverage policy,? and that they will work to ?update the clinical indications for reimbursement.? Redberg told me, ?Many of us who reviewed the cases for the DOJ felt this statement misrepresents the verdict.? She said it implied the problem was one of outdated guidelines, adding ?many, if not most of the cases we looked at not only violated the CMS guidelines, but were also unjustified by any clinical data other than the MD?s opinion, and were clearly outside any boundaries of good or appropriate care.? In the end it all comes down to money versus the scientific evidence with patients caught in the middle of the ongoing tug-of-war. If ever there were a story that needs more attention from the news media, this is it. If patients can?t trust their doctors or their hospitals to follow evidence-based guidelines and give them the best care that science and the evidence suggest, who can they rely on?",

The challenge lies in killing only a specific set of cells in a living organism, and without greatly harming the organism in the process. Obviously something more discriminating than bleach is called for. The mainstay of the last generation of cancer therapies, chemotherapy, is a fine balance between harming cancer cells as much as possible while harming the patient as little as possible. It isn't a pleasant experience, and it does have significant and lasting negative impact. The best that can be said of it is that it is much better than the alternative. The promise of new technologies allowing delivery of therapeutics to individual cells based on their specific differences in surface or internal chemistry is that existing chemotherapy drugs can be used with minimal doses and near-absent side effects, and yet still be more efficient when it comes to removing cancerous cells. This is one example of many targeted delivery mechanisms under development or in trials: At the heart of the new therapy is a chemotherapeutic agent called doxorubicin (dox). The drug has been a mainstay of cancer treatment for years, as it jams up DNA in the cell nucleus and prevents tumor cells from dividing. But when it's injected into the bloodstream, the drug can also kill heart muscle cells and cause heart failure. Delivering dox only to tumor cells is therefore highly desirable, but it has been a major challenge. Thus researchers have spent years developing porous silicon particles as drug carriers. The particles' micrometer-scale size and disk-like shape allows them travel unimpeded through normal blood vessels. But when they hit blood vessels around tumors, which are typically malformed and leaky, the particles fall out of the circulation and pool near the tumor. That was step one in delivering chemotherapeutic drugs to their target. But just filling such particles with dox doesn't do much good. Even if a small amount of the drug finds its way inside tumor cells, those cells often have membrane proteins that act as tiny pumps to push the drug back outside the cell before it can do any damage. To get large amounts of dox inside the metastatic tumor cells and then past the protein pumps, researchers linked numerous dox molecules to stringlike molecules called polymers. They then infused the dox-carrying polymers into their silicon microparticles and injected them into mice that had been implanted with human metastatic liver and lung tumors. The silicon particles congregated in and around tumor sites, and once there the particles slowly degraded over 2 to 4 weeks. As they did so, the silicon particles released the dox-carrying polymer strands. In the watery environment around tumor cells, the strands coiled up into tiny balls, each just 20-80 nanometers across. That size is ideal, because it's the same size as tiny vesicles that are commonly exchanged between neighboring cells as part of their normal chemical communication. In this case, the dox-polymer balls were readily taken up by tumor cells. Once there, a large fraction was carried internally away from the dox-exporting pumps at cell membrane and toward the nucleus. Not only is the region around the nucleus devoid of dox-removing pumps, but it typically has a more acidic environment than near the cell membrane. The researchers designed the chemical links between dox molecules and the polymer to dissolve under acidic conditions. This releases the dox at the site where its cell killing potency is highest. Up to 50% of cancer-bearing mice given the treatment showed no signs of metastatic tumors 8 months later. The results are promising enough that the researchers are planning to launch clinical trials in cancer patients within a year. The new work holds out hope for improving the effectiveness of other chemotherapy drugs as well.

The report suffers from several notable flaws. Most glaringly, AARP underplays the value of the Medicare Part D program and ignores the stability in the program brought about by market competition: Average annual out of pocket spending on drugs for Medicare Part D beneficiaries has fallen in recent years, declining 16 percent between 2007 and 2012, from $468 per beneficiary to $392. Monthly premiums for Medicare Part D have been remained at about the same level for the past decade. In 2006, the average monthly premium was $32.20, compared to $34.10 today. In reviewing AARP?s report, other facts to bear in mind include the following: First, the report relies upon prices reported by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to insurers, prices that do not necessarily include the often substantial rebates paid by drug manufacturers to PBMs. Second, the report fails to consider the large cost savings medicines generate in other areas of the healthcare system by, for example, reducing hospital stays and physician office visits. Consider the following: In 2011, a study published in Health Affairs found that for patients with congestive heart failure who took their medicines as directed by their physicians, the benefit-to-cost ratio was 8 to 1. In other words, for every $1 they spent on medicine, they SAVED eight times that much in reduced costs in other parts of the healthcare system. Similarly, for diabetes patients, the benefit-cost ratio was 6:1 ? spend a dollar, save six. A similar trend was seen for patients with other chronic conditions like hypertension and dyslipidemia. A paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that overall, a $1 increase in prescription drug spending is associated with a $2.06 reduction in Medicare spending. Third, it?s important to note that AARP is far from the disinterested and pure advocate for seniors it pretends to be when the organization talks about drug prices. AARP earns hundreds of millions of dollars annually from UnitedHealthcare, which offers AARP-endorsed insurance products in the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Prescription Drug Plans and Medigap programs. These close financial ties to the insurance industry raise serious questions about whether AARP is focused on serving their own financial interests at the expense of their members. Seniors deserve access to the innovative medicines that are available today and baby boomers will be well served indeed by the ability of biopharmaceutical companies to develop the next generation of medicines to prevent, treat, or cure the chronic diseases they face. It is unfortunate that AARP seems to be more concerned with its own bottom line than the health and well-being of current and future seniors.",

Just released two-year follow up data comparing coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) with combined CABG and mitral-valve repair in patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) found no significant differences in benefit. The patients with CABG and mitral-valve repair had an early hazard of longer hospital stay post-surgery, a higher incidence of postoperative supraventricular arrhythmias and higher rate of serious neurological events than those with CABG alone. There was a three-fold higher incidence of persistent mitral regurgitation in this same group without evidence of higher mortality or adverse clinical events. The study authors conclude that physicians must weigh risks of adverse events ?against the uncertain benefits? of combing mitral-valve repair during CABG. These highly anticipated study findings, Two-Year Outcomes of Surgical Treatment of Moderate Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation, were presented today by Robert Michler, M.D. at the American College of Cardiology Scientific Session 2016 and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine by the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN). This is the first study of its kind to provide evidence-based data on how best to treat patients needing CABG who also present with IMR. It is expected that this two-year data will impact how the medical community of physicians, surgeons and institutions will manage this patient population going forward. ?The results of this study suggest there is no significant benefit to what is often considered a routine addition to the open-heart procedure of CABG for patients with moderate IMR,? said first study author Robert Michler, M.D., professor and chairman, Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, and the Department of Surgery at Montefiore Health System and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and co-director of The Montefiore Einstein Center for Heart and Vascular Care. ?However, after two years, we did find that the addition of mitral-valve repair provided a more durable correction of mitral regurgitation.? IMR occurs when blood backflows into the left atrium from the left ventricle of the heart due to improper closure of the MV. The condition often develops as a complication of a heart attack and subsequent enlargement of the left ventricle, the heart?s main pumping chamber. Functional IMR affects 1.6 million to 2.8 million patients in the U.S. and is associated with a doubling in mortality among patients with mild or greater degrees of mitral regurgitation after a heart attack. ?The approach to managing patients with moderate ischemic MR at the time of coronary artery bypass grafting remains controversial. The results of this trial study should inform surgical decision making when caring for these complex patients,? said Annetine C. Gelijns, Ph.D., the Edmond A. Guggenheim Professor of Health Policy and chair of the Department of Health Evidence and Policy at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the principal investigator for the Data Coordinating Center based at Mount Sinai. Ischemic mitral regurgitation of moderate severity develops in approximately 10 percent of patients after myocardial infarction. Mitral regurgitation is caused by the dISPlacement of papillary muscle, leaflet tethering, reduced closing forces, and annular dilatation. Over time, the condition has an adverse effect on the rate of survival free of heart failure. Because most patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation have multivessel coronary artery disease requiring revascularization, surgeons have to consider whether to add mitral-valve repair to coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG). The prospective, multi-center, controlled clinical trial randomly assigned 301 patients with moderate IMR to CABG alone or CABG with MV repair. The primary endpoint was left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESVI) at one-year, assessed using a Wilcoxon rank sum test categorizing deaths as the lowest LVESVI rank. Two-year mortality was 10 percent in CABG/MV repair patients versus 10.6 percent in CABG patients. There were no observed differences in MACCE, death, readmissions, functional status or quality-of-life at two years. Overall rates of hospital readmission and serious adverse events were similar in the two groups, but neurologic events and supraventricular arrhythmias remained more frequent in the combined-procedure group. The CTSN DCC is based at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, which has eight core clinical centers in the U.S. and Canada, including Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Columbia University, Duke University, Emory University, Montefiore Einstein Heart Center, Montreal Heart Institute, University of Virginia, University of Pennsylvania and 19 Consortium sites. This study was presented at the Featured Clinical Research Session I: Two-year Outcomes of Surgical Treatment of Moderate Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation: A Randomized Clinical Trial from The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network The Moderate Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation trial was supported by a cooperative agreement (U01 HL088942) funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

If the Government had wanted to eradicate racism, well, they just shifted the racism pressure onto different races. White people are second class citizens in america. There ARE NO ASIANS. i haven't seen a chinese person or asain since i ate at a chinese restaraunt, and that not for over five years. If asians are cooking, they are making it. if they are not cooking in America, they do not exist. The Mexican Population has been enslaved whereas they once enslaved africans. Candidates want to build ""Walls on the mexican Border To Keep The Illegal Aliens From Coming Into Our Country."" Heh, brilliant, a Wall. like the Great wall of China. What, are the mexicans going to climb trees next? They are not monkeys they are hispanics. It troubles me. And Blacks, well, i'm not really qualified to look them in the eyes because i am a white woman....so, i don't look at them or speak to them. If I See A Black Person I LEave Or Avert My Eyes. This is not by personal choice! instead, this is the unspoken social class laws that our society has invented since Obama. I see them and I Just Look Down. In JEsus' Name,Amen.////",

If you aren?t experiencing high blood pressure, then you most likely know someone who is. According to the American Heart Association, more than 40 percent of Blacks are living with high blood pressure. Blacks have the highest prevalence of the disease than any other race. Some experts believe, however, that one vegetable is the key to preventing heart diseases such as high blood pressure. The beet! Researchers found the link between a stiffening heart and high blood pressure, which makes the heart muscle thicken. In the 2010 study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology, experts learned that a half a liter of beet juice can do wonders for a young man?s diet. It improved their exercise and performance each day. Another study, in 2011, found that people ages 54 to 80 also improved their peripheral vascular disease with beet juice. Here are some additional drinks that can help people with hypertension: Water This is the healthiest way to manage hypertension, of course. But you already knew that. With dehydration, blood vessels can constrict and the body goes into water saving mode. Therefore, the body reduces the amount of water loss through sweat, urination and breathing. Your heart works harder, and your blood pressure goes up. Water will help prevent chronic dehydrations and your blood vessels from tightening. Hibiscus tea Hibiscus is packed with bioactive phytochemicals, which are natural ACE inhibitors. Studies show that this tea can be used to lower blood pressure. Pomegranate juice &lt;img class=?alignright size-medium wp-image-444638? src=?https://ioneblackdoctor.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/cranberry-juice.jpg?w=300&amp;#038;h=200? alt=?Fresh Cranberry Juice? width=?300? height=?200? title=?Lower High Blood Pressure With These 6 Drinks? /&gt;Not only is it tasty, but it?s healthy for those with hypertension. Those ACE inhibitors can also be found in pomegranates. In one study, this juice reduced ACE ? an enzyme which can raise blood pressure ? by 36 percent. Low-fat milk Studies have long found calcium to be beneficial to lower blood pressure levels. Don?t go for the full-fat and whole milks, though. Low-fat milk has more calcium and doesn?t contain the added fat found in whole milk. Cranberry juice This juice is good for more than just UTIs. Filled with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, cranberry juice can prevent any spikes in blood pressure. It can also dilate blood vessels, which increases blood flow. Be sure to get the unsweetened version of cranberry juice, as the added sugar is no good for your heart.

""North Korea informed the IMO today that it will amend the date of its planned missile launch to between Feb. 7 and 14,"" said a South Korean government official on the condition of anonymity.Seoul says the trajectory of the missile and other details are the same - just the launch window has been adjusted.The Seoul government held an emergency meeting presided over by Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se to counter the possible launch.""(The military) stays on readiness posture to respond whenever North Korea fires a missile,"" said a defense ministry official on the condition of the anonymity.Experts earlier expected that the North would likely launch the rocket around Feb. 16, the birthday of the former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, who died due to heart failure in 2011""Weather in the North Korea Dongchang-ri launch site area is expected to be good between Feb. 7 and Feb. 10,"" said the official, forecasting the launch could take place as early as on Sunday.The Seoul government forecasts that Pyongyang has completed preparation, including the fueling of the rocket at the launch pad on its rocket site.""The Seoul government believes that (North Korea) completed its launch preparation, such as fueling the rocket after erecting it on a launch pad after considering various circumstances,"" said another defense ministry official.The Korea Meteorological Administration, Seoul's weather agency, said that rain or snow was forecast in the launch site region on Monday afternoon.Meanwhile, it is expected to be sunny on Sunday, prompting experts to speculate that the North may pull off the launch earlier.""It is safer to pull off the launch as soon as possible considering the instability of the liquid fuel,"" said a missile expert, citing that North already loaded fuel into a rocket.Pyongyang notified the IMO of its change of launch window Saturday morning but did not send similar notices to other U.N agencies such as the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Telecommunication Union.Earlier in the day, the Japanese government confirmed Pyongyang's plan to move forward the launch period, according to Japan's Kyodo News Agency. ""We are in the process of confirming since there is so much information,"" Gen Nakatani, Japan's defense minister, was quoted by Kyodo News as saying.Ahead of the notification, the U.S. Pacific Command called on North Korea to refrain from ""irresponsible provocations,"" responding to its move to fire a long-range rocket.""No one should doubt that U.S. Pacific Command forces, including U.S. forces in Korea, are prepared to protect the American homeland and defend our allies in South Korea and Japan,""Hawaii-based command spokesman U.S. Navy Capt. Cody Chiles told Yonhap News Agency.The North looks set to launch what the outside world views as an intercontinental ballistic missile.""We are aware of North Korea's announcement of their rocket launch and are closely monitoring the situation. We continue to call on North Korea to refrain from irresponsible provocations,"" Chiles said.He added that the U.S. operates many platforms in the Pacific including Aegis ships, the THAAD advanced missile defense system, sea-based X-band radar, and other assets.Earlier in the day, Defense Minister Han Min-koo visited an Aegis-equipped destroyer tasked with immediately detecting North Korea's long-range rocket in case of a launch, his ministry said. Aboard the 7600-ton KDX-III destroyer Seoae Ryu Seong-ryong, Han instructed the troops to maintain full combat posture with North Korea poised to launch what it claims to be a space vehicle.Also, top military officers of both South Korea and the U.S made a joint tour of the Joint Security Area inside the truce village of Panmunjom.Gen. Lee Sun-jin, chairman of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), and U.S. Forces Korea commander Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti called for full combined combat readiness, according to the JCS.North Korea argues the launch is a space vehicle, a claim refuted by South Korea which contends that long-range rockets and intercontinental ballistic missiles are basically the same.The North has repeatedly pledged to boost its nuclear capabilities, viewing its nuclear program as a powerful deterrent against what it claims is Washington's hostile policy toward it.U.N. sanctions prohibit North Korea from any launch using ballistic missile technology.

Luckily I managed to rescue it before Jasper, the enthusiastic cocker spaniel, chewed it up. Apparently a wide-ranging study has shown that loneliness increases the chance of heart failure and stroke. Loneliness has never been regarded as a disease ? or even as a cause of disease ? but researchers at the University of York have examined no fewer than 35 different studies covering some 30 000 people and come to the conclusion that loneliness increases the risk of heart failure and strokes by as much as 30 percent. Loneliness has also been linked to damaged immune systems and high blood pressure. I?ve written before that I believe loneliness to be one of the big problems of the modern world. We live in an age of communication but the reality is we are increasingly isolated. Children ?chat? remotely with their parents in a weekly Skype message. So-called ?friends? meet each other on Facebook or Twitter. We are in constant touch with the world electronically. But that doesn?t mean we have real human contacts. In the ?old? days parents, children and grandparents grew up together in the family home. There was always somebody around to share a story or listen to a complaint. Today fathers work long hours. Mothers have full-time jobs and young adults are on the first rungs of the Ladder of Success. There?s very little time for warm, personal contact. Old people are sent to retirement villages, students live in residences. Successful businessmen are seldom at home. Many people in densely populated cities live lives of sad loneliness. We do not know our neighbours and we?re afraid of strangers. No wonder the statistics for heart attacks and strokes are so appalling if the York study is true. Maybe what we need is more community activities, rather than improved public health care and medical aid schemes. If you?re a member of a book club or craft centre or hiking group, perhaps you should be trying to draw your neighbours into your circle. If you know of somebody who leads a quiet, solitary life, you might invite them along to your club or organisation to meet new people. The trouble with loneliness is that very few people will admit they?re lonely. It seems like an admission of failure. We realise there are bad people around ? muggers, pickpockets, fraudsters and swindlers. But the reality is there are more good people than bad. We have a choice: we can cower behind closed doors and risk dying a lonely death by heart failure, or we can take a chance on life and get out there to meet new people, possibly be mugged or have our pockets picked, but at least be part of the big, real world. It?s actually quite an exciting place. Last Laugh Two young women were having coffee together when one noticed her friend flashing a big diamond ring. ?Wow, that?s an impressive stone!? She said, ?Tell me about it.? ?This is the famous Goldberg diamond,? she said. ?It is worth millions, but it comes with a terrible curse.? ?Oh really? What?s the curse?? ?Goldberg.?",

Normally, if moderate leakage is found, the patient is monitored yearly to see if there is progression of the condition. If there is, they try to find the optimal timing to do repairs to avoid the heart adapting too much to the new, leaky situation If the heart can not handle the amount of leakage, it starts to compensate which results in abnormal sizes of left ventricle and atrium. This should preferably be prevented or kept limited as it will eventually end in heart failure. I am no doctor but it seems to me that you are in this compensation phase. Your EF (ejection fraction) is still good (normal range is 55-70%), but your left atrium is enlarged from the amount of blood that flows back from the ventricle and your left ventricle is enlarged and stiffened while trying to pump enough blood through your body . It is a bit premature perhaps to say, but if it is the mitral valve that is causing the trouble, there is a good chance that they can repair it, often with minimal invasive surgery. Once the leakage is reduced, your heart may (at least partially) regain is normal size. Hope this helps you a little. God bless, Ger",

And if there ever was a single marker for lifespan, insulin would be it. That's the general consensus, anyway. That's what scientists gather so far researching people who live passed the age of 100. More importantly, they're finding that what all these people have in common is insulin sensitivity (the opposite of insulin resistance). Generally speaking, when you eat a healthful diet and live a natural lifestyle, your cells are sensitive to insulin and absorb it readily; however, more than 29 million people in the US suffer from some form of diabetes and another 86 million have prediabetes; and almost all of them have insulin resistance. Those are some pretty staggering numbers! How many of those 115 million insulin resistant individuals do you suppose will live to be 100+ years old? And at the base of all chronic conditions of aging lies insulin resistance. When your cells are resistant to insulin, it not only speeds up the aging process, it also speeds up the progression of the disease, itself. Insulin is a double whammy! So now that we know that aging is a disease, what are the symptoms of that disease (that doctors often misdiagnose as diseases themselves)? Well, here's a bunch: cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, cancer and every other chronic and autoimmune disease known to man. Speaking of symptoms, let's switch gears for a minute. What happens when you have a cold, your nose is running and you go see a doctor? What's the first thing he prescribes? A decongestant, right? Do you know what happens to most patients who get prescribed a decongestant for a runny nose? They end up with a sinus infection. Have you ever wondered why that is? According to Dr. Rosedale: ""What happens when you treat the symptom of a runny nose from a cold and you take a decongestant? Well, it certainly decongests you by shutting off the mucus, but why do you have the mucus? It's because your body is trying to clean and wash out the membranes. What else is in mucus? Secretory IgA, a very strong antibody to kill the virus. If there is no mucus, there is no secretory IgA. ""Decongestants also constrict blood vessels, the little capillaries, or arterioles, that go to those capillaries, and the cilia, the little hair-like projections that beat to push mucus along to create a stream. They get paralyzed because they don't have blood flow, so there is no more ciliary movement. ""What happens if you dam a stream and create a pond? ""In days you've got larvae growing, but if the stream is moving, you are fine. You need a constant stream of mucus to get rid of and prevent an infection. I am going into this in some detail because in almost all cases, if you treat a symptom you are going to make the disease worse. The symptom is there as your body's attempt to heal itself."" Have you noticed how these days, there's always a bunch of new diseases popping up? Why do you suppose that is? Doctors have taken it upon themselves to divide various symptoms of one disease into a bunch of new diseases. I suppose you'd call it ""branching out."" (It's a business, after all!) Building on our ""cold"" model, these days, when you come see a doctor for a runny nose from a cold, he sees no problem at all diagnosing you with rhinitis (a stuffy nose); but he doesn't bother asking why you have a stuffy nose! Is the stuffy nose by itself a disease? No, it's the symptom of a disease, but unless you go to the root of the problem, you'll never actually cure the disease. You'll be stuck treating symptoms for the rest of your life! Switching gears again, what happens when your doctor diagnoses you with high cholesterol? Could you even call high cholesterol a disease all by itself? Seems to me there's an underlying cause of your high cholesterol, but your doctor won't bother looking for it; instead he'll write you a prescription for high cholesterol medication and what do you suppose that high cholesterol medication will end up doing to your heart? It'll totally mess it up! Your doctor could have spared you a heart attack had he dug a little deeper and found what was actually causing your high cholesterol, rather than treating it as a disease. Then again, that's not profitable; he couldn't charge you for by-pass surgery if he cures you before he gets your money! Building further on that cold example, along with a decongestant, your doctor might also give you an antibiotic. But why? You suppose doctors don't ""know"" that almost all upper respiratory infections are caused by a virus? They know it; but that doesn't stop them from prescribing an antibiotic, which can do more harm than good. What kind of harm, you ask? Antibiotics mess with your gut flora and kill good gut bacteria, leaving your immune system vulnerable and weak. Now how can THAT help your cold? If you're lucky, your doctor will be honest with you and send you home. The best medicine for a cold (or any virus) is rest. Often times, a virus will run its course and disappear; and your immune system will get stronger fighting it than if it were to get suppressed, instead. Then again, your doctor might question why you caught a cold in the first place and prescribe vitamin C for a weak immune system. So, you go home and take your vitamin C and several days later, you're still sick. What happened; why didn't the vitamin C work? Almost all living organisms make vitamin C except for humans, so humans need to get theirs from an outside source. But, what's vitamin C made from? You'd be surprised to know that vitamin C is actually made directly from glucose and has a similar structure. In fact, they compete with one another. Given that, why won't your body take up vitamin C? Well, according to Dr. Rosedale: ""It has been known for many decades that sugar depresses the immune system. It was only in the '70s that they found out that vitamin C was needed by white blood cells so that they could phagocytize bacteria and viruses. White blood cells require a fifty times higher concentration, at least inside the cell as outside, so they have to accumulate vitamin C. ""There is something called a phagocytic index, which tells you how rapidly a particular macrophage or lymphocyte can gobble up a virus, bacteria, or cancer cell. In the '70s, Linus Pauling knew that white blood cells needed a high dose of vitamin C and that is when he came up with his theory that you need high doses of vitamin C to combat the common cold. ""But if we know that vitamin C and glucose have similar chemical structure, what happens when sugar levels go up? They compete for one another upon entering the cells. And the thing that mediates the entry of vitamin C into the cells is the same thing that mediates the entry of glucose into the cells. If there is more glucose around then less vitamin C will be allowed into the cell, and it doesn't take much glucose to have this effect. A blood sugar value of 120 reduces the phagocytic index 75 percent."" Now we're getting somewhere! The fact is, before you can cure a disease, you need to actually segregate that disease; that's what I like to call ""getting to the root of the problem."" And it doesn't matter what disease you're dealing with, the root will always be at the cellular level and insulin will always play a major part of it. So, what IS the purpose of insulin, anyway? In some more primitive organisms, it's to control lifespan. But in humans? Well, ask your doctor what HE thinks insulin is for. I wouldn't be surprised if he said it's to lower blood sugar; but that'd only be half of the story! Why did organisms even develop insulin? What was its evolutionary purpose? You can't get too far if you don't first understand some basic things about insulin. And as it were, insulin's main purpose is to store excess nutrients. You know that caveman diet you've hard so much of lately? Where does it get its basis from? Have you heard of something called ""feast or famine?"" That's what our ancestors lived with on a regular basis. They didn't always have a steady stream or supply of food; they couldn't make a coffee run in the middle of the night! If they were lucky, they caught a saber-toothed tiger and ate for several days; if not, they were faced with hunger (or, famine) and who knew how long it'd be before they would eat again. Their organisms adjusted to it; but that's not the case anymore. In some of the major cities in the US, there are more than enough grocery and convenience stores, not to mention fast food joints and restaurants and diners and all kinds of eateries around; no one ever went hungry from a lack of food in the US (only from a lack of funds)! But none of us would be here today if our ancestors weren't able to store nutrients feasting for later use, during times of famine. And insulin was what allowed them to do just that! When you eat a high carb meal, it raises your blood sugar. When your blood sugar is elevated, it signals to your pancreas to release insulin, because you got more than you need to burn at the time; so your insulin kicks in and transports the glucose out of your blood and into your liver for later use. How does it get stored? In the form of glycogen. But your glycogen stores get filled up pretty fast, and when your liver can't store anymore glucose as glycogen, it begins storing it as saturated fat mostly in the form of palmitic acid -- which is a solid fat that's very hard to burn. That's why it's odd the ADA (still) recommends diabetics eat a diet high in carbs and low in fat because essentially what that means is, eating sugar all day long! Your body won't actually use it to burn because passed a certain point, it just gets stored as bad fat in your body. And there's NO energy in THAT! But, what are insulin's other roles? Well, it being an anabolic hormone, it also builds muscle and stores protein. Another thing it stores is magnesium; but when your cells become insulin resistant, guess what? You can't store it anymore and you end up peeing it all out! You need magnesium to relax your muscles, so when you're not storing enough because you're insulin resistant, you lose magnesium and your blood vessels contract. That's when your blood pressure shoots up and you begin to lose energy seeing as magnesium is needed for all energy producing reactions that take place within the cell. Moreover, for your body to produce insulin and for that insulin to function properly, your cells need magnesium. So, when insulin levels go up, magnesium levels go down and your cells become more and more resistant to insulin. And then blood vessels tighten up making it impossible for glucose and insulin to penetrate them, which makes them even more insulin resistant, causing you to lose more magnesium. It's a vicious cycle, to say the least; and it gets its start even before you're born. Did you know that your own insulin sensitivity is determined the moment the sperm meets the egg? What's more, the worse a pregnant woman's diet (the higher it is in processed carbs) the more likely the fetus will become insulin resistant, as well. So much for insulin resistant diabetic women getting pregnant -- you're just setting your baby up for a slew of health problems even before he's born! Let's talk congestive heart failure, shall we? When you lose magnesium and your blood vessels contract, you get high blood pressure. But not only do you lose magnesium with high levels of insulin, you also retain too much sodium. And when you retain too much sodium, you retain too much fluid; and when you have high blood pressure and retain too much water, what happens to you? If you said you develop congestive heart failure, you're right! Too much insulin stimulates the sympathetic nervous system (I'm sure you've heard of the the fight or flight response?) and as a result, your body produces too much cortisol and you don't want to know what too much cortisol can do to your heart! Some years back, a study proved that a majority of heart attacks happen after a high-carb meal; and yet, it's very unlikely to have a heart attack after a high fat meal. Interesting, indeed. Goes against everything we've ever been taught by the USDA! How does a high-carb meal cause a heart attack? Well, let's just assume you're prone to having one, it goes something like this: Your insulin goes way up after a high-carb meal, which triggers the sympathetic nervous system, which causes your arteries to spasm and tighten up; so if you're prone to having a heart attack, this would be a good a time as any! If not, it may just surprise you! There's also a direct correlation between triglyceride levels and insulin levels (in some people more than others) so when doctors claim that food alone cannot lower cholesterol, they're basically lying to get you to pay for medication so they can keep you on their roster; seeing as insulin moderates blood lipids. All it takes to lowering bad cholesterol is getting insulin levels back to normal and voila -- you can easily control blood lipids by controlling insulin! But, why do cells become insulin resistant, anyway? Basically, they're trying to protect themselves from the harmful effects of too much insulin, so they shut it out by adjusting their receptor activity and number of receptors -- that way they're not constantly bombarded by so much poison. In a way, they're trying to turn the volume down on all that ""noise."" And in time, they become desensitized to it, which in a small way, is a good thing. Some people have insulin resistance but you can't really label them diabetic, either; these people have a normal fasting blood sugar, but a very high level of insulin in their system. They also have a super pancreas, that keeps cranking out more and more insulin as the body demands more of it at every high-carb meal. But, eventually, your pancreas will, too, give up, and where will that leave you? An insulin dependent type 2 diabetic! This kind of insulin resistance is part of the hyperinsulinemia that's responsible for all the so-called diseases that come with aging; it's the number one main cause of aging in practically all life forms. That's how important insulin is! And that's why it's crucial to control and maintain your insulin sensitivity. Insulin, being the mitogenic hormone that it is, stimulates cell proliferation and cell division. And if all the cells in our body were to become resistant to insulin at the same time, there wouldn't be so much of a problem; but they all become resistant in their own time; while some never become resistant to insulin at all. But of the cells that do become resistant to insulin, it goes something like this: First, the liver shuts it out, then muscle tissue and then the fat. Just as the liver become resistant to insulin, it slow the making of sugar way down. That's why some people have low blood sugar before they get diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. So where does all that sugar in your body come from? According to Dr. Rosedale: ""The sugar floating around in your body at any one time is the result of two things, the sugar that you have eaten and how much sugar your liver has made. When you wake up in the morning it is more of a reflection of how much sugar your liver has made. If your liver is listening to insulin properly it won't make much sugar in the middle of the night. If your liver is resistant, those brakes are lifted and your liver starts making a bunch of sugar, so you wake up with a bunch of sugar."" Next, what happens when your muscles become insulin resistant? What does insulin even do to muscles? For the most part, it lets them burn sugar for energy; and when they're resistant to insulin, they can't burn all the sugar in your body and use it, so it builds up in your blood. When the liver produces too much sugar that the muscles can't use, your blood sugar begins to rise. And lastly, fat cells -- it takes them quite a bit longer to get desensitized to insulin. But, when they do be...",

Her killer swerved in front of the couple?s car, approached with a .38 revolver, and shot Harold in the side of the face, while her boyfriend managed to escape. Investigating police found an abandoned building nearby, filled with pornographic pictures, but its full significance would not be revealed until nearly two years later. Early in 1959, the Jackson family was driving along a dirt road in Virginia, returning home, when they were forced to stop and abducted at gunpoint. Two months later, two men came across the bodies of Carroll Jackson and his one year-old daughter Janet, dumped in a remote area of Fredericksburg, Virginia. A short time later, Mildred Jackson and her five-year-old daughter Susan were found buried in a shallow grave, just outside the abandoned building that police had discovered when investigating Harold?s murder. Mildred had been brutally raped in the same room where the pornographic pictures had been found two years earlier. Since investigators were reasonably certain that the same killer had committed the murders, the media jumped on the story. Tips began to pour in, and although most of them were worthless, one pointed authorities towards Melvin Rees. Rees was eventually found in West Memphis, working as a piano salesman. Margaret Harold?s boyfriend picked him out of a lineup and a search of his home turned up a .38 pistol. The most damning evidence, however, was a note paper clipped to a newspaper article about Mildred Jackson in which Rees described his horrific crimes in detail. Detectives found evidence that linked Rees to the slayings of four other young women in the Maryland area as well. Rees was tried in February 1961 for the murder of Margaret Harold and in September 1961 for the murders of the Jackson family. He was convicted of both and sentenced to death. His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1972, and he died in prison from heart failure in 1995. Check back every Monday for a new installment of ?This Week in Crime History.?

Ejection fraction rate changes very slowly if at all. In my opinion, the best ejection fraction rate test for the patient is simply to monitor the swelling in lower legs or where ever it is present. The swelling is an indicator of how well the heart is able to pump fluid including blood throughout the body. Also, watch the amount of La-six that is needed to keep the swelling under control. If more is needed, it is an indication that the ejection fraction may be getting worse over a long period of time. I can eat salmon for meat for a week and have a good EF test or eat lean beef for a week and have a worsening EF test! Also eat at least 3 meals a day at the same time and keep to moderate/small portion sizes of all foods! Avoid beef (even lean beef) with rare exception. As well as other high saturated fats which are known to have a severe effect on the fatty deposits and calcium buildup in the veins. The fastest relief I have found is to have a portion of salmon (canned is fine) for several meals in a row. Also be sure to have a small portion size of beef or fatty food when eating it. I have learned to be very careful about is to avoid at all cost all oils that contain hydrogen. Hydrogenated oils last a long time in the storage and help foods to rise and be fluffy. The bad news is that they cause a build up in the arteries of gunk and have been shown in any amount taken in to cause hardening of the arteries, high blood pressure, and leads to worse including artery disease which may make you not able to have a successful bypass surgery if needed! If a food says in the ingredient list hydrogenated, partially hydrogenated or hydro-anything I simply avoid it. The other ingredient is exercise. Walking in any amount is exercise! Walk for a heart rate that is appropriate for the patient! I am 58 with congestive heart failure and my exercise heart rate should be anywhere between 103 and 135 as determined by a professional nursing staff in a cardiac rehab facility. If my heart rate is over 135, I can't walk and talk without beginning to be out of breath. If walking across the room makes the patient out of breath, that is beyond their current limit of heart rate combined with the heart's ability to pump blood (EF) and too much stress on the heart. Start a half of what their limit is and build up to being able to do that twice daily which may take several weeks! If possible over time , increase the walk time to 20 minutes and then up to 20 minutes twice daily. When ever putting the body under stress of exercise take enough magnesium! Get some magnesium phosphate 30x strength! At the first hint of a muscle cramp, put 4 of these pills under your tongue and let them dissolve! And keep hydrated! That means drink water and avoid caffeine! First sign of possible heart problems:2005 sleep apnea (waking up more than 200 times per hour!) that doesn't let your heart rest as it should, easily out of breath when exercising, moderate blood pressure (occasionally in the high range), 2010 heart attack, congestive heart failure (low ejection fraction) and enlarged heart, triple by-pass surgery, and 2011 ICD just in case my heart goes racing or stops. 50% of congestive heart failure patients do not live 5 years beyond diagnosis! Now I have lost 25 lbs, no sleep apnea, no high blood pressure, normal ejection fraction (which means that my heart has been able to rest as it should instead of going too fast and is more able to pump as it should) Changed my diet and exercise habits and going strong!",

Although getting lost in a book had always previously been one of my favourite things to do in my spare time, I found that with the increasing number of hours my head was in a textbook, I slowly started to lose interest in reading for fun anymore. This year I reignited my interest, and with it I found that the act of reading personal stories?someone?s narrative?could offer doctors more than just the pleasure of a good book. I recently read Inside the O?Briens, a story where Joe, a family man, is diagnosed with Huntington?s disease. The book portrays the difficulties Joe experiences, going from the dependable father and rock of the family, to someone he doesn?t recognise anymore. That sense of loss of who you once were, and the inability to have control over the person you are, is captured powerfully and movingly, and it opened my eyes to how patients with a neurodegenerative condition, such as Huntington?s, can experience its effects. Some time after reading the book, I encountered a patient with Parkinson?s disease. Seeing how this patient couldn?t control their tremors or their speech, the memories of Joe?s frustration came back to me and the empathy I felt was magnified. When learning about Huntington?s I had memorised the ?dancing propensities? of the characteristic chorea, the fluctuating emotions, and the genetically imprisoned fate of patients. However, after reading this book I saw how it affected Joe as a person: his view of himself, his family coming to terms with it, the reactions of people who knew about his diagnosis and those who didn?t. As medical students, we often need a first person insight to even partially understand how much a condition can affect an individual. This is most commonly (and preferably) acquired by way of seeing a patient and speaking with them. But with the vast number of diseases present, we should also find other means to acquire this insight; especially in neurological conditions where the patient may not be able to tell us themselves. It was in this way that I came across Still Alice, a book that is unflinching in how it depicts the debilitating way that loss of memory can impact someone?s life and their functions. However, whereas Alice was aware of her diagnosis before being greatly affected by it, it had crept up on Maud, the main character in Elizabeth is Missing, as it so commonly does for many patients. Maud?s confusion, her attempts to try to remember, her forgetfulness during everyday tasks, and her disposition were all laid out for the reader to experience. Before reading this book I had seen many patients with Alzheimer?s in geriatric wards?I?d looked at their blood results and x-rays when they came in with pneumonia, worsening heart failure, or a stroke, and these physical problems seemed the biggest priority. Now, while I agree that these problems are more immediate, I can?t see that they are more important. I commend our NHS and its attempt to see the person behind the disease with the This Is Me tool. Since reading this book, I have actively looked for this document in the notes and tried to use it when speaking to the patient, which has led to some astonishingly positive results. As a result of my reading I have asked better questions, become more empathetic, and these diseases have become more than just a list of signs and symptoms to remember. But, as much as I have enjoyed these medical fictional reads, I have also enjoyed my other fiction too. So next time you want to relax, pick up a book. You may be surprised by what you learn from it. The renowned neurologist Oliver Sacks famously said ?In examining disease, we gain wisdom about anatomy and physiology and biology. In examining the person with disease, we gain wisdom about life.? Reading has the ability to do just this. Read into the mechanics of disease, yes, but do not forget to explore the person behind the syndromic shadow.

Friday, April 15, 2016. (Delayna Earley/The Island Packet via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT Share Photo ? OAKMONT, Pa. It was an ugly debut in the U.S. Open. Three years removed from winning the NCAA individual and team championships at UCLA, Kevin Chappell earned a spot in the 2011 Open at Congressional Country Club and was staggered by opening with a 76. In a single round, Chappell fell 11 shots behind the eventual runaway winner, Rory McIlroy. ?You?re out of the tournament ? that?s what it feels like,? Chappell recalled. ?I really had to gather myself.? It has been a theme for Chappell at junctures in his life ? the harder things become, the better he responds, even in the face of terrible tragedy. The death of Chappell?s older brother in his senior year at UCLA inspired him to all but carry the Bruins team on his back to the national title in ?08. And the 29-year-old Fresno native?s playing career has been one of starts and stops, modest hits and achingly close misses. This season, Chappell has thrice finished second ? twice to world No. 1 Jason Day, in the Arnold Palmer Invitational and The Players Championship. Yet he?s never been in a better position for a breakthrough than now, ranked 37th in the world on the eve of the 116th U.S. Open that begins Thursday at Oakmont Country Club. And while many players bemoan the difficult test the course will produce, Chappell said Tuesday, ?It?s going to be fun ? all the different strategies you have to use.? This is how Chappell handles adversity: After that terrible first effort at Congressional, he shot 67 in the second round. Then a 69. And on Sunday, while McIlroy cruised to his eight-stroke win, Chappell stormed home with a 66 that pushed him into a tie for third. Not so ugly after all. A year later in the U.S. Open at Olympic Club, Chappell hit more greens in regulation than all but three players and tied for 10th. More evidence of his tough-mindedness. ?I think he loves it when it?s tough,? UCLA golf coach Derek Freeman said. ?He knows that there are players that are not going to be able to physically handle it and mentally handle it. He knows that right off the bat he can have success with that.? Freeman saw it first-hand in the 2008 NCAA Championships. They were contested at Purdue?s home course, which was the longest in tournament history and possibly the nastiest. It was basically the U.S. Open of college golf, Freeman said. ?Kevin is such an incredible ball-striker, he just beat everybody up with his long and mid-irons,? the coach said. Chappell seized the individual title as the only player with a red number at 2 under. Rickie Fowler shot 6 over. Billy Horschel finished at plus 7. Chappell also made the putt that clinched UCLA?s second ever team championship ? by one shot over Stanford and two over rival USC. ?I still don?t think I?ve had as great a team leader as I had in him,? Freeman said. ?He?s one of those guys who could say things other guys didn?t want to hear, but once he said it, they knew he was right.? It was the support of his UCLA team ?brothers? that got Chappell through a dark time after his own brother, Steven Casey Chappell, died in his sleep from heart failure in October 2007 at the age of 24. ?We had a good group of guys, and they became family,? Chappell explained here Tuesday. ?I relied on them. I knew I owed it to them to be the leader. My focus really turned to golf in that situation. That?s how I coped with the loss.? Page:",

Adolescents with a body mass index of 20 ? 18.5 to 25 is considered to be normal ? and over, face a heightened risk. Though researchers were taken aback, a less surprising finding was that that risk rises steeply to a nearly 10-fold higher risk in those who were very obese ? a BMI of 35 or over. Researchers found that in men with a BMI of 20 and over, the risk of heart failure increased by 16 per cent with every BMI unit. A surprising new study has revealed teenagers who are classified as being of normal weight are at increased risk of suffering heart failure in middle age That was after adjustments for factors that could affect the results, such as age, year of enlistment to the Swedish armed forces, other diseases, parental education, blood pressure, IQ, muscle strength and fitness. Dr Annika Rosengren, professor of medicine at the Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, who led the research, said: ?Although most studies define a normal weight as having a BMI between 18.5 and 25, this is probably not an appropriate definition in the young, most of whom are naturally thin. ?This may be why we see an increase in the risk of heart failure starting at a fairly low BMI level. ?However, it was surprising to see the very steep increase in risk with increasing body weight above a BMI of 20. ?Given the global trend for growing numbers of teenagers to be overweight and obese, our findings suggest that heart failure, which in this study occurred at the relatively early average age of about 47 may well become a major threat to health worldwide. ?This serves to underline the urgent need for action worldwide to curb the obesity epidemic. ?Action needs to be taken by governments as well as by individuals, for instance by creating an environment that does not promote overweight and obesity, and that encourages people not to be sedentary and not to eat more than they need. ?This is more important than hassling people into dieting whatever shape they are. ?Once established, overweight and obesity is much harder to tackle.? A less surprising finding was that that risk rises steeply to a nearly 10-fold higher risk in those who were very obese ? a BMI of 35 or over. Researchers found that in men with a BMI of 20 and over, the risk of heart failure increased by 16 per cent with every BMI unit Until recently, Swedish law required all 18-year-old men to enlist in the armed forces, and between 1968 and 2005, a total of 1,810,348 men were enlisted and underwent set physical and cognitive examinations. For this study, Professor Rosengren and her colleagues analysed data on 1,610,437 men from the conscript registry. Action needs to be taken by governments as well as by individuals, for instance by creating an environment that does not promote overweight and obesity, and that encourages people not to be sedentary and not to eat more than they need Professor Annika Rosengren, University of Gothenburg They followed the men from the time they were conscripted at 18, for between five to 42 years ? the average follow up time was 23 years. During that time, 5,482 men were admitted to hospital for heart failure, with an average age at diagnosis of nearly 47. Men with a BMI of 20 to 22.5 at the time of conscription had a 22 per cent increased risk of suffering heart failure ? compared with those with a BMI of 18.5 to 20, once adjusting factors had been taken into account. That risk nearly doubled for those with a BMI of 22.5 to 25, and more than tripled for those with a BMI between 25 and 27.5. The risk increased more than six-fold for those classified as obese ? with a BMI of 30 to 35 ? and was almost 10-fold for the very obese ? a BMI of 35 or more. Researchers said their findings suggest that preventative action must be taken earlier in life. Professor Rosengren said: ?Current prevention guidelines are meant to guide doctors treating patients with factors that may put them at increased risk of heart and blood vessel problems within the next decade or so. ?The overwhelming majority of young people have an extremely low risk of any such problems and so are not in need of preventative measures on an individual basis, except for firm anti-smoking advise. The risk increased more than six-fold for those classified as obese ? with a BMI of 30 to 35 ? and was almost 10-fold for the very obese ? a BMI of 35 or more ?However, our findings show the importance of body weight in adolescence and suggest that more emphasis should be placed on the maintenance of a healthy body weight from an early age as a preventative measure.? The researchers do note there were some limitations with their study. They include the fact that their findings are only applicable to men and that overall women have a lower risk of heart failure than men. Furthermore the researchers did not have any information on weight gain after the men were conscripted at 18, so that a slightly greater weight at 18, might be an indicator of an increased risk of subsequently becoming overweight or obese, which in itself, would be a risk factor for heart failure. However, the strength of the study is its large size, encompassing more than 1.6 million participants. The study is published in the European Heart Journal.

Boston Scientific Corporation Boston Scientific Corporation and Mayo Clinic today announced a continuing collaboration where the two organizations share intellectual property and stimulate the rapid development of medical devices to address unmet clinical needs. MARLBOROUGH, Mass. and ROCHESTER, Minn. , March 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX ) and Mayo Clinic today announced a continuing collaboration where the two organizations share intellectual property and stimulate the rapid development of medical devices to address unmet clinical needs. Small and nimble teams of Boston Scientific engineers and Mayo Clinic physicians have been working together to develop new medical technologies in areas that include interventional cardiology, heart rhythm management, endoscopy, neuromodulation, urology and pelvic health. The collaboration enables both parties to contribute ideas and intellectual property to solve pressing medical problems and builds upon the strengths of both parties. Mayo Clinic, which cared for 1.3 million patients in 2015, offers cutting-edge medical and surgical expertise in all disciplines, and has a long history of innovative clinical research and technology development. ""Open approaches to innovation, such as our collaboration with Mayo Clinic, can more quickly put better tools and devices in the hands of physicians to improve the health and well-being of patients,"" says Michael F. Mahoney , president and CEO, Boston Scientific. ""Our continued investment in this collaboration is an example of our commitment to further investing in jobs and innovation as a result of the recent suspension of the Medical Device Tax."" Several programs are underway, including two Mayo Clinic studies evaluating: A guide catheter designed to enable a physician to pass a guidewire across a narrowed aortic valve as part of the procedure for catheter-based aortic valve replacement. In the current procedure, physicians may struggle to feed the wire across the stenotic valve's strong current of blood. Doing so can increase procedure time, a patient's exposure to X-rays and even cause damage to the valve and arteries. It may also dislodge plaque that could result in a stroke. The catheter design shows promise in positioning the guidewire more easily during the procedure. Use of the Boston Scientific Precision Spectra Spinal Cord Stimulator System to block the neural signals that trigger shortness of breath and muscle fatigue during exercise among patients with heart failure. This study will evaluate if blocking signals from organs to the brain can moderate control of the heart and vasculature for these patients. In the U.S., the Precision Spectra System is indicated as an aid in the management of chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs, including unilateral or bilateral pain associated with failed back surgery syndrome, intractable low back pain and leg pain. ""We are grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with Boston Scientific,"" says John Noseworthy, M.D. , president and CEO, Mayo Clinic . ""Working together can allow us to swiftly bring our discovery and innovation to the direct benefit of patients."" The collaboration is being managed through Mayo Clinic Ventures , which serves Mayo Clinic by finding partners that can bring Mayo's inventions to the marketplace to improve medicine everywhere. Mayo Clinic Ventures' mission is straightforward: Commercialize Mayo Clinic technologies for the benefit of patients worldwide while generating revenue to support clinical practice, research and education at Mayo Clinic.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has strengthened the existing warning about the risk of acute kidney injury for the type 2 diabetes medicines canagliflozin (Invokana, Invokamet) and dapagliflozin (Farxiga, Xigduo XR). Based on recent reports, we have revised the warnings in the drug labels to include information about acute kidney injury and added recommendations to minimize this risk. Patients should seek medical attention immediately if they experience signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury. This is a serious condition in which the kidneys suddenly stop working, causing dangerous levels of wastes to build up in the body. Signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury may include decreased urine or swelling in the legs or feet. Patients should not stop taking their medicine without first talking to their health care professionals. Doing so can lead to uncontrolled blood sugar levels that can be harmful. Health care professionals should consider factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury prior to starting them on canagliflozin or dapagliflozin. These include decreased blood volume; chronic kidney insufficiency; congestive heart failure; and taking other medications such as diuretics, blood pressure medicines called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Assess kidney function prior to starting canagliflozin or dapagliflozin and monitor periodically thereafter. If acute kidney injury occurs, promptly discontinue the drug and treat the kidney impairment. For more information, please visit: canagliflozin and dapagliflozin.

After only 6 days, you likely don't have to taper it, you should be able to just cleanly switch from one to the other. The spikes usually occur, when you abruptly stop such a medication, without being on others or switching to a different one, unless your doctor tells you otherwise, if you're unsure, don't be afraid to call her and double check. When I first started taking blood pressure and cardiac medications, I had to switch quite a few times, due to the fact that I am very sensitive to side effects and my cardiologist just always had me do a clean switch. The FDA lists the typical side effects of Amlodipine as possibly including nausea , dizziness, headache, increased urination and hypotension . As to the elevation you experienced, sometimes there doesn't have to be any stressing factors, it just happens, some of us develop high blood pressure . It may be genetic, due to other medical conditions, or idiopathic. Mine soared so high that I developed severe edema and experienced congestive heart failure at only 38 years old.

[/quote] I'm sorry I didn't make it more clear. BMY had two trials; one in second line and one in first line melanoma. While reviewing the results of the second line trial (which was completed with a marginal p value after numerous protocol modifications) for the second line NDA the FDA peaked at the interim results of ongoing first line trial in melanoma. Once approved (based, in part, on that peek of the first line trial) it was only approved for second line. The patients in the ongoing first line trial did not have access to it (as the approval wasn't for first line). It's further complicated by the fact that the first line trial didnt have an HLA restriction while the second line trial did. Even though the second line trial only enrolled a specific HLA subtype, the FDA approved the second line treatment in all HLA subtypes (a highly unusual move because the approved indication population was different than the tested population). ..................... A rough analogy would be if Vascepa had a trial in both Heart Failure (HF) patients as well as REDUCE-IT (patients with HF are """"sicker"""" than RI patients; they would be the analogy of """"second line"""" here). If the HF trial came back marginal and the FDA requested a peek at the upcoming RI interim and then approved V for HF (not RI population) that would be a roughly analogous situation.",

Researchers studied almost 430,000 people with a condition known as atrial fibrillation, an irregular rapid heartbeat that can lead to stoke, heart failure and chronic fatigue. More than half of the atrial fibrillation patients at the highest risk of stroke didn?t get prescriptions for blood thinners ? also called anticoagulants ? the study found. Most strokes occur when a clot blocks a blood vessel supplying the brain; blood thinners can prevent clots from forming or stop existing clots from getting bigger. ?We have identified a continued treatment gap in patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke,? said lead study author Dr. Jonathan Hsu, a heart specialist at the University of California, San Diego. ?Our study should act as a wake-up call ? we as practitioners and patients need to be aware of the stroke risk that exists with atrial fibrillation and find ways to do better in treating at-risk patients with potentially life-saving oral anticoagulants,? Hsu added by email. In atrial fibrillation, electrical impulses in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic, and the atrial walls quiver rather than contract normally in moving blood to the lower chambers. This can lead to the formation of clots, and atrial fibrillation patients have up to seven times the stroke risk of people without the disorder. To see how many atrial fibrillation patients receive needed pills to avert clots, Hsu and colleagues reviewed medical and prescription data collected from 2008 to 2012 in a national registry of people with cardiovascular disease. The patients were 71 years old on average and about 56 percent were men. Overall, 45 percent of them received blood thinners, researchers report in JAMA Cardiology. Another 31 percent of the patients took aspirin, which can reduce the risk of strokes by preventing platelets in the blood from attaching to debris on blood vessel walls and can also lead to clots. Some of the people on aspirin paired it with anti-platelet medications known as thienopyrdine. Roughly one in four patients took no medication at all to avoid clots or strokes. Side effects may partly explain the limited use of blood thinners. Long-term use of the blood thinner warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) can increase the risk of severe bleeding, and it?s inconvenient because it requires frequent lab tests and check-ups to ensure that patients have the right dose. One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on whether patients had medical reasons that would prevent their use of blood thinners, the authors note. People with conditions that can increase the risk of bleeding problems ? like high blood pressure, cancer, kidney problems or alcoholism ? might not be able to take warfarin. Another shortcoming is that they assessed blood thinner prescriptions at initial doctor visits, and didn?t see whether people stopped or started medication based on follow-up exams, the researchers also point out. ?It takes time and effort to have the appropriate discussion with patients and their families and to prescribe and monitor these therapies,? said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, co-director of the University of California, Los Angeles Preventive Cardiology Program and researcher at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Anticoagulants can reduce the risk of stroke for atrial fibrillation patients by 80 percent, Fonarow, author of an accompanying editorial, said by email. ?Patients with any history of atrial fibrillation who are not receiving an oral anticoagulant should discuss with their physicians the specific benefits and potential risks of treatment,? Fonarow added. SOURCE: http://bit.ly/1R3OPR9 and http://bit.ly/1ZwNjdw JAMA Cardiology, online March 16, 2016.",

491,BLOG,http://everything-beautiful.com,http://www.everything-beautiful.com/how-to-tell-if-youre-iron-deficient/,4/19/2016,20:52:43,4/20/2016 6:22,How to Tell if You?re Iron Deficient,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficit in the WORLD as well as the leading cause of anemia. It effects approximately 20% of women (up to 50% of woman during pregnancy), and 3% of men as recorded by Statistics Canada in 2012. Since iron is critical for producing hemoglobin (the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout your entire body), it?s pretty essential to your total well-being! That being said, you?re going to suffer from a multitude of health consequences if your iron stores are low. Here are several things to look out for: Signs You May Be Iron Deficient Fatigue/tiredness ? the most common symptom of iron deficiency, and yet because many of us hold busy lives, it may be difficult to detect. Since less oxygen is being received by the tissues due to lack of iron, your body becomes deprived of energy ? and the result is chronic fatigue! Headaches ? with less oxygen being delivered to the brain, this can lead to a swelling of the arteries and frequent ensuing headaches. At the same time, this will result in impaired focus and concentration! Breathlessness ? due to lowered oxygen levels, it will be more difficult to ?catch your breath? when doing any type of physical activity, as simple as climbing the stairs. This can also contribute to an overworked heart which may cause irregular beats, murmurs, enlargement, and in very severe cases, heart failure. Pale Skin ? if you notice that your skin is paler than usual or you have a noticeably white complexion, you may want to consider iron deficiency. You can also check the inside of your lips, gums, and the inside of your lower eyelids, which will not be as red as usual if there is iron deficiency present. Hemoglobin is what gives your skin its bright, rosy hue ? therefore, in decreased levels, it will effect your skin tone and mucus membranes. Hair Loss ? your hair follicles are dependent on oxygen and proper blood flow for their vitality and the strength! Absence of iron and thus, depleted oxygen, will cause hair fallout and thinning. Anxiety ? lack of iron can actually heighten the sympathetic nervous system, tricking the body in believing its in a ?fight or flight? response mode, due to impaired hormone function and a lack of oxygen. Cravings for Ice, Dirt, or Clay ? although ice may be a common craving, oddly enough, so can dirt or clay! This however, is indicative of an iron deficiency given that our bodies are screaming out for minerals in the form of these unusual items. Low thyroid function ? iron deficiency can also slow your body?s thyroid function and create this co-morbid health issue. You may also notice weight gain, dry skin, and decreased body temperature. Causes of Iron Deficiency Heavy Periods ? if you are a woman and experience heavy menstruation, you are susceptible to iron deficiency due to excessive blood loss. Check with your doctor if you are experiencing heavier than normal periods or menstruating for extended periods of time. Injury/Blood loss ? in cases of injury or trauma where there is a measurable amount of blood loss, this may lead to an iron deficiency (albeit temporary). Insufficient Dietary Iron ? if you are consuming a diet with insufficient iron, this will no doubt cause a deficiency! If you are vegan or vegetarian, you may want to pay closer attention to the amount and sources of iron you are receiving from your diet. Pregnancy ? during pregnancy, the fetus actually predominates the mom?s iron stores as it?s survival becomes the body?s priority! For many women, this can exacerbate an existing iron deficiency or cause one during the length of her term. During pregnancy, iron should be tested on a regular basis. Celiac/Infammatory Bowel Disease ? gastrointestinal issues like Crohn?s disease or ulcerative colitis not only cause inflammation and damage to the digestive tract and cause chronic blood loss, but will also result in the impaired absorption of nutrients ? i.e. iron! How Iron Deficiency is Diagnosed Your doctor will diagnose an iron deficiency based on your medical history, physical exam, as well as lab work. Often, a Complete Blood Count (CBC) is done, followed by serum iron, serum ferritin, and serum transferrin levels {aka total iron binding capacity}. If it is suspected that internal bleeding is contributing to an iron deficiency, a fecal occult blood test may also be undertaken to assess for blood in the stools. Food Sources High in Iron The amount of iron you need depends on your age, gender, pregnancy, and overall health (i.e. disease, inflammation, and absorptive capacity). Women ages 19-50 need approximately 18mg of iron/day, while women after age 50 and adult men need about 8mg/day. Black Strap Molasses ? 15mg (1 tbsp) = 3.6 mg; not only high in iron, but a deliciously natural sweetener! Spinach ? 125 ml (1/2 cup) cooked = 3.4 mg; makes for a yummy iron-rich stir-fry! Nettle ? 1 cup ? 1.46 mg; nettle is also an amazing nutritive for the body and contains detoxifying qualities! Yellow Dock ? 1 ounce of root = 22 mg iron; yellow dock is known as the STOREHOUSE for organic and easily assimilated plant-based iron! Red Meat ? a well-absorbed heme source of iron, however, there are many more health benefits to consuming a predominantly plant-based diet than would be received from regular red meat consumption. TIPS: Always consume non-heme iron (i.e. plant-based) with a source of vitamin C (i.e. citrus fruits) for optimal absorption. Dairy products inhibit iron absorption (and are overall congestive, constipating, and bad for the body ? best to avoid them wherever possible!) Caffeine and phosphates from soda interfere with iron absorption ? limit and/or avoid! Cooking in cast iron pans increase the iron content of foods ? use them! Regular exercise increase the body?s demand for oxygen and actually increases the absorption of iron in the body. Another reason to stay fit Iron Supplementation If you are very low in iron, you may require higher therapeutic doses that may be difficult to obtain from diet alone at first. Land Art?s PURE IRON is a concentrated and bio-available source of iron that is easily assimilated by the body. AND it doesn?t cause constipation!

Councillor Grady?s son, also called Edward, expressed the family?s appreciation at the funeral service for his father which was held at Woodside Crematorium in Paisley. Councillor Grady died of heart failure at the age of 66. ?It has been a particularly hard time for the family as my father?s passing was so sudden and we are all still coming to terms with that,? said Edward. ?But we have taken great comfort from the regard and affection in which my father was clearly held by so many people. ?Whether in his trades union involvement, or his service as a councillor where he was proud to represent the Labour Party and his local community, he showed the same values in public that we saw at home. ?When he did something, he did it right. When he saw an injustice he stood up against it. And when people in the community needed help, he was there for them, working away without show or fuss. ?We will all miss him very much.? The large crowd at the funeral service brought back memories of Councillor Grady?s varied life. He served his apprenticeship as a welder and worked in the Fairfield shipyard as well as at Babcock and Wilcox, and Rolls Royce. Councillor Grady was also an officer in the Army cadet Corps from 1976-88, and was a Past Master in the Lodge Prince of Wales Masonic.

He went to the gym, he told me; not since Bush was president, she countered. They?d been going on like this since they entered the exam room. Today was my first time seeing them?and one of my first times seeing two patients at once, a growing trend in medicine. As I was wrapping up, Francine stopped me: ?Can we talk about his vision?? Leo?s eyesight was getting worse, particularly at night. He denied it?but when I probed further, he admitted that his vision wasn?t what it used to be. Several times, Francine added, he?d been in near accidents while driving at night. The three of us worked out a plan where Leo could drive during the day for short distances and Francine would drive him at night. While Leo had some objections, Francine promised that he would follow it. After both of them left that day, I couldn?t help thinking that Francine may have saved her husband?s life. The American Academy of Family Physicians estimates that around 10 percent of family doctors now give patients the option to share their appointments with people who have similar health issues. For doctors, the benefits are obvious: Shared visits are efficient, allowing us to see more patients in a day. And they can help patients adopt healthy behaviors in a way that one-on-one visits don?t. A person?s smoking, diet, and exercise habits can depend in large part on the behavior of his or her friends, family, or coworkers. In a landmark study in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2008, Yale sociologist Nicholas Christakis found that when a spouse, friend, or sibling quit smoking, a person?s chances of smoking decreased 67 percent, 36 percent, and 25 percent, respectively. Other research has found similar positive social-network effects for things like medication adherence. Shared visits can help patients adopt healthy behaviors in a way that one-on-one visits don?t. Much of health, in other words, is shared. For some conditions, like a cold or a sprained ankle, medical advice is simple; social support won?t make much of a difference. But managing conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure can be overwhelming, and stress makes patients less likely to carry out doctors? instructions. Being around others may help. Group doctor visits may improve the ability of patients with heart failure or diabetes to retain medical information by 10 to 30 percent, research has shown. A study presented at the 2014 American College of Cardiology annual meeting found that being married dramatically lowered one?s chance of heart disease, possibly because a spouse helped reinforce medication adherence and exercise habits. Despite these outcomes, it?s easy to see why shared medical appointments aren?t more popular. They go against two principles that have defined medicine: the patient-doctor relationship and confidentiality. Sometimes, though, that relationship isn?t enough. One of my patients has been seeing me for months in an effort to quit smoking. Her previous doctor prescribed nicotine patches, gum, pills; nothing worked. The reason: Her brother had moved in, and smoking was the one thing they did together. Unless she could get her brother to stop, she told me, it would be impossible for her to quit. I told her to bring her brother to her next visit?and I hope to persuade them to find a new shared activity. As Leo and Francine have taught me, having someone else in the room can make all the difference. The Atlantic (October 2, 2015), Copyright ? 2015 by The Atlantic Monthly Group, theatlantic.com.

The therapy overexpresses SERCA2a, an approach already under development for the treatment of heart failure. When targeted to blood vessels it can produce remodeling, compensating in part for the narrowing that is the proximate cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension - though without addressing any of the root causes, as is unfortunately still the case in the majority of medical research. Scientists have used a novel gene therapy to halt the progression of pulmonary hypertension, a form of high blood pressure in the lung blood vessels that is linked to heart failure. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, rapidly progressing disease that occurs when blood pressure is too high in vessels leading from the heart to the lungs. There is currently no cure for PAH, and about 50 percent of people who are diagnosed will die from the disease within five years. The high pressure is caused by abnormal remodeling of the lung blood vessels that sometimes leads to failure of the right ventricle and premature death. Thickening and narrowing of pulmonary vessels is seen with all types of pulmonary hypertension and is triggered by abnormal calcium levels within the vascular cells. The sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump (SERCA2a) regulates intracellular calcium in vascular cells and prevents them from proliferating in the vessel wall. There were two primary objectives for this study. First, scientists wanted to learn if it is feasible to deliver a therapeutic gene called SERCA2a in aerosol form to damaged blood vessels of the lung using an engineered adeno-associated virus as a ""vector."" Second, they wanted to see if there was a sustained beneficial impact, and if the transferred genes effectively slowed or stopped the vascular changes in the airways that are the hallmark of PAH and other forms of pulmonary hypertension. The current study is the first to explore this approach in a large animal - specifically, a Yorkshire swine model that closely resembles PAH in humans. In the study, 20 pigs were divided into two groups, half of which received the aerosolized viral vector carrying the SERCA2a gene and half a saline spray. Two months after the gene delivery, scientists performed tests to see if the new therapeutic genes were present and functioning in the vessels of the animals' lungs, and whether the transfer was producing the desired effects. When they examined the animals, they found that that heart and lung function had improved and abnormal cellular changes causing PH were reduced. Additional animal studies focusing on long-term efficacy and safety are warranted before advancing this approach, known as airway gene delivery, to human clinical trials. That's because the current study involved a small number of animals, and they were assessed just eight weeks after gene delivery. Nevertheless, airway gene delivery appears to modify fundamental pathophysiology, and therefore might offer therapeutic benefit to humans with a variety of pulmonary vascular diseases.

In the early step, the weight of the blood causes to fill the left ventricle from the left atrium. In the second step, the left atrium squeezes out the last bit of blood into the left ventricle. The speed at which this happens is called ""E""in the first step and ""A"" in the second step. In a healthy heart E is bigger than A so the ratio E/A is >1. When E/A is below 0.75, this is often accepted as a marker of diastolic dysfunction. There are however other parameters that have to be taken into account to conclude that there is diastolic dysfunction. Sometimes doppler images are not so good and that can result in less reliable results. Your cardiologist takes all his observations and all (not just a single isolated) parameters that are measured with the echo into account, and draws his conclusion then. I also have had some weird doppler measurements that got me alarmed and that did not alarm my cardiologist very much. One year later everything was back to normal again.

Quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary policy used by some central banks to increase the supply of money by increasing the excess reserves of the banking system, generally through buying of the central government's own bonds to stabilize or raise their prices and thereby lower long-term interest rates. This policy is usually invoked when the normal methods to control the money supply have failed, ie the bank interest rate, discount rate and / or interbank interest rate are either at, or close to, zero. It has been termed the electronic equivalent of simply printing legal tender. [1] A central bank implements quantitative easing by first crediting its own account with money it creates ex nihilo ( ""out of nothing""). [2] It then purchases financial assets, including government bonds, agency debt, mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds, from banks and other financial institutions in a process referred to as open market operations. The purchases, by way of account deposits, give banks the excess reserves required for them to create new money, and thus hopefully induce a stimulation of the economy, by the process of deposit multiplication from increased lending in the fractional reserve banking system. Risks include the policy being more effective than intended, spurring hyperinflation, or the risk of not being effective enough , if banks opt simply to sit on the additional cash in order to increase their capital reserves in a climate of increasing defaults in their present loan portfolio [2] ""Quantitative"" refers to the fact that a specific quantity of money is being created.; ""easing"" refers to reducing the pressure on banks. [3] However, another explanation is that the name comes from the Japanese-language expression for ""stimulatory monetary policy"", which uses the term ""easing"". [4] Quantitative easing is sometimes colloquially described as ""printing money"" although in reality the money is simply shifted from member bank dollar deposits to financial instruments. [5] Examples of economies where this policy has been used include Japan during the early 2000s, and the United States, the United Kingdom and the Eurozone during the global financial crisis of 2008-the present, since the programme is suitable for economies where the bank interest rate, discount rate and / or interbank interest rate are either at, or close to, zero. QE is a monetary policy by the central bank through open market operations to increase the money supply, can be regarded as ""out of nothing"" to create a specified amount of money [1], has also been described as a simplified indirectly by printing money. Its operation is the central bank to buy securities through open market operations, banks increase capital within the central bank clearing accounts of the banking system to inject new liquidity. ""Quantitative easing"" of the ""quantification"" means a specified amount of money will create, and ""liberal"" refers to reducing the financial pressure banks. [2] central bank to use money created out of thin air to purchase government bonds in the open market, deposit-taking institutions to lend money to buy assets from banks. These have helped reduce yields on government bonds and lower the overnight interbank interest rate, the bank can only earn so awash in low interest assets, the central bank expects the bank will therefore be more willing to provide loans to earn a return, [3] relieve the financial pressure the market. When the money has been loose, or purchased as inflation and depreciation of the assets (such as treasury bonds), the tendency to devalue the currency quantitative easing will. Since quantitative easing may increase the risk of currency devaluation, the government usually introduced quantitative easing measures when experiencing deflation. And sustained quantitative easing will increase the risk of inflation. [Edit] stimulate lending in the fractional reserve system, banks to maintain a certain percentage of the reserve, the remaining funds can be used for loans. Increase from the quantitative easing process deposits, banks can borrow, re-create more of the money supply, that the multiplier effect of deposit (deposit multiplication). For example, assume the reserve requirement is 10%, the creation of $ 10,000 per quantitative easing, the money supply may eventually produce for $ 100,000. QE to provide adequate liquidity to local banks in the interbank market, greatly reducing the cost of borrowing, and ultimately all borrowers can expect to benefit, in order to support the operation of the overall economy. In general, quantitative easing to support the economy, and ""help to relieve or suppress the impact of the economic downturn."" [4] Although described as ""the power to print money,"" but usually only adjust the quantitative easing computer accounts. [1] For a country to implement quantitative easing, must have control over their money; therefore, for example, individual euro-zone countries can not unilaterally introduced the quantitative easing policy. [Edit] Examples of when to cut interest rates to increase the money supply does not work when the central bank will likely introduction of quantitative easing measures; typically occurs when interest rates near zero. Among them, the Bank of Japan to implement quantitative easing in the early 2000s to combat deflation [5]. For the 2007 global financial crisis, the US Federal Reserve Bernanke QE means to cope. Britain is also in the quantitative easing monetary policy as to minimize the impact of the financial crisis [6] [7] [8].

Originally opened to house people displaced by the Yugoslav wars, the camp still holds about 100 Serbs from Croatia. One of them, Jela Vuksa, a camp resident for more than 20 years, now passes her days watching busloads of new refugees arriving from the Middle East. ""Look, here they come!"" said the 74-year-old grandmother while sitting on her porch in a blue flower print dress. ""This group has so many children. I hope they put them in one of the good barracks."" The camp, officially called the Krnjaca Asylum Center, opened its doors to newcomers last summer as the flow of Europe-bound refugees increased drastically. Since then, refugees from the Balkan wars have been living here side-by-side with contemporary refugees, and in doing so, the two groups are finding common ground in their shared experiences. ""They are equal to me,"" Vuksa said. ""Anyone who is forced to leave their home is going to have a hard life. We are in the same situation and I understand them. When Vuksa hears war stories from Syrian and Afghan refugees, she cannot help thinking of her own. Aside from crossing a body of water on a rubber dinghy, she said her personal experience is very similar to what is now happening in the Middle East. Back in 1995, when she first arrived at Krnjaca camp, Vuksa said she couldn't stop crying. She had fled her home in Zagreb and watched helplessly as one of her sons died from gangrene after a bomb blast tore off part of his leg. With her remaining son, daughter and husband, she settled into a new life in Serbia, quickly occupying herself by fixing up gardens for the barracks and cleaning the camp grounds - which served as a labor camp during the Soviet era. But her husband had difficulty adapting to life as a refugee and died of heart failure in 2000. ""When we came here and he saw how we were living, he was so ashamed,"" Vuksa said. ""He didn't want to see his family live like this and his blood pressure went up. ""I see the same pain in the faces of the Arab refugees. No father or mother wants to see their children in bad conditions,"" she added.",

But it's still early in terms of understanding how these sorts of data can be used--and what regulators will make of them. One biotech, Gilead Sciences ($GILD) has started a major Phase II/III trial of its novel hypertrophic cardiomyopathy candidate eleclazine that incorporates the iRhythm Zio Patch to measure an exploratory endpoint. The cardiac monitoring patch, which can be worn continuously for up to two weeks with subsequent data analysis, is being used to measure an exploratory trial endpoint--the change in arrhythmia burden including premature ventricular complexes, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common inherited cardiac disorder. It's the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults and a major cause of morbidity due to chronic heart failure symptoms. It occurs in about one in 500 adults, but only a fraction of them are diagnosed. There is no approved treatment for HCM. As the disease progresses, a number of cardiac problems can occur such as diastolic heart failure, microvascular dysfunction, atrial fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. The ongoing Gilead eleclazine study is called LIBERTY-HCM; as part of the study patients will receive ""periodic arrhythmic burden assessments using iRhythm's ZIO Service to determine if the investigational treatment improves symptoms such as AFib in patients with symptomatic HCM,"" according to iRhythm. The 180-patient trial started in February 2015; it's slated to have final primary endpoint data in January 2017 with study completion in June 2019. The primary outcome is change in peak oxygen uptake (VO2) from baseline screening to 24 weeks. The LIBERTY-HCM trial is the first and largest randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to test eleclazine, a late sodium current (INaL) inhibitor, in patients with symptomatic HCM. The iRhythm patch is also in a massive up to 6,100 patient trial by the Scripps Translational Science Institute (STSI) to identify asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AFib) patients that launched late last year.",

It was a simple question, but all expressed difficulty coming up with a simple answer, because of the myriad factors involved. However, each of them focused on a crucial concept that they wanted to share with readers. What is your number one tip for a healthy heart? Virginia Hyland, a critical care nurse at Community Hospital in Munster, said, ?It?s important to follow a heart-healthy lifestyle, which includes exercise, eating healthy?a variety of foods, in moderation?following up with your physician for prevention, taking the appropriate medications as needed, and not smoking.? Dawn Smit, a cardiac rehab charge nurse at Franciscan St. Margaret Health in Hammond, urged people to ?know your risk factors and know your numbers, such as blood pressure, cholesterol and weight. And make sure you know what?s normal so you know what lifestyle changes you need to make.? And for those who have already had a heart problem and are focusing on rehabilitation and recovery, Smit said, ?Afterwards, build relationships with people who have also had some type of cardiac event, so you don?t feel so alone. That?s what cardiac rehab is all about.? For those who are high risk or who have had a heart problem, Barb Ehlers, cardiac nurse at Ingalls Memorial Hospital, pointed out the necessity of being compliant with your health care provider?s advice. ?Follow your doctor?s orders!? she said. ?Take your prescribed medicines. It?s so important to know your medications and why you?re taking them.? ?My number one recommendation for keeping your heart healthy is to follow a low sodium diet and exercise,? said Jami Jackson, heart failure coordinator at Porter Regional Hospital. ?You can modify that if you need to, but eating a low sodium diet is something we stress to our heart failure patients.? Christina DuBois, a nurse with Methodist Hospitals, adds, ?My number one tip for a healthy heart is a good general diet and exercise. Watch what you eat. Stay away from fatty foods, processed meats, as well as canned fruits and vegetables, which contain a lot of salt.?

I seemed to have got more breathless since using the CPAP machine. Rang the hospital and they said machine should not make me breathless.

Sometimes this is a wrong move since the pains are an indicator of a more complex medical condition. A painful irritation in itself is not a sickness, but the resultant effect is sometimes a disease. A visit to a pain doctor Houston professional is the ultimate step that you should take to verify whether your discomfort is indicative. This article expounds on some of the pains that are indicative. One of the pains that you should not overlook is severe morning headache. A mild headache can go unnoticed, but a severe headache denotes an acute health issue such as a brain tumor. The condition is rare. Therefore, you should not think of a brain tumor every time your head hurts in the morning. The incidence of a primary brain tumor is usually below one percent. At times, you may experience a stomach irritation that occurs between the navel and the breastplate. It is usually in the form of a burning sensation, and it indicates several medical conditions including ulcers. This type of pain has other complimentary signs such as blood in the stool and getting a relief each time you take a meal. Blood clots and congestive heart failure have a common sign where one experiences discomfort on legs. The earlier sign is a swelling and painful discomfort on one leg whereas the other sign is swelling in both legs. Blood clots come after one has a recent surgery or rests for a long time. Traveling on a plane or a car sometimes also results in having a blood clot. Sometimes you can have a severe back irritation that wakes you up from a deep sleep at night. Not only is such an irritation disruptive to a restful night, but it can also be a sign of fever or cancer especially if you have a family history of such conditions. It is tempting just to assume that the discomfort is out of the wear and tear of the body, but it can be an indicator of more complex health conditions. Having a painful discomfort that feels as if it is penetrating the back is a sign that you should never ignore. Sometimes it is a sign that your arteries can be hardening gradually, and that is why you experience the irritation. One of the early indicators of diabetes is having a feeling of pins and needles in the feet. A lot of people live with diabetes since they tend to ignore the feeling. What follows after the feeling is numbness of the feet. Making a prompt visit to a specialist after having the pins and needles in the feet enables one to manage diabetes at its early stages. Having the discussed signs does not necessarily mean that you have the medical conditions that are associated with them. However, it is only a doctor who can confirm the nature of the resultant medical conditions that the pains indicate. Therefore, you should make a visit to a specialist to have the pains examined.

Initial impression presents an obese 65 year old male with gross respiratory distress, tripod, audible rales and with one word sentences, pale, diaphoretic and anxious. High flow nasal cannula underneath a CPAP mask with 10 cmH2O of PEEP is placed. Initial vital signs of RR 36 ppm, HR 118, irregular, BP 210/108, SpO2 93 % on 100% oxygen. Primary survey is as above, GCS 15, no focal neurological deficits, unremarkable skin inspection, no s/s of trauma. SAMPLE history significant for increasing DOE with orthopnea and PND x 2 weeks, worse today. NKDA, Metformin, coreg, ASA, Lipitor, Glipizide, amlodipine, lasix and plavix. CAD s/p PCI with stents, AFib, DM2, hypercholesterolemia, HTN 12 lead ECG narrow-complex Afib with RVR @ 120 bpm, lateral T-wave inversion. Repeat VS unchanged. So what?s our next step?CPAP, IV Access, and maybe Lasix in select cases. Nitroglycerin for preload reduction? Tabs, spray or paste is not going to work; leaves nitroglycerin infusion. NTG Infusions have been effective, depending on how aggressive the dosing schedule, nitro can rapidly reduce the blood pressure and after load. KEY FACTS: ? Standard NTG Infusion concentration is 200 mcg/mL; 50mg of Nitroglycerin in 250 mL of D5W either pre-mixed in a glass infusion vial or mixed at the beside. ? Nitro infusions can be given using the 3/10 rule. Every 3 mL/hr is equal to 10 mcg/min of NTG infusion. For example: 50 mcg/min is 15 mL/hr infusion (3 x 5=15), 200 mcg/min is 60 ml/hr (3 x 20=60), 400 mcg/min is 120 mL/hr infusion (3 X 40=120). ? Every 2 mL of Nitro Infusion is 400 mcg, equal to one SL tablet or spray pump. ? If 1 tablet or 2mL bolus is given every 5 minutes, this equals 80 mcg/min. ? Sublingual administration is very similar to IV infusion in bioavailability and time of onset. ? Leave the pump in the cabinet and give 1 mL to 2 mL of the standard NTG Solution every minute, 200-400 mcg/min, titrated to effect. ? Using a 10 fold dilution of the concentrated vial can be used as a Push Dose Nitro Solution. 5 mg (1 mL of the concentrated NTG Vial) mixed with 9 mL of Saline is 500 mcg/mL. Give 1 mL or 500 mcg every 60-90 seconds to lower the blood pressure. Nitroglycerin lowers preload via venous vasodilation at low doses and lowers after load via arterial vasodilation at high doses, this makes our vascular container larger lowering the systemic pressure. Aggressive, high dose NTG paired with the recruitment of the alveoli using CPAP & PEEP make up the mainstay of pre-hospital treatment of APE and decompensated heart failure. Bolus doses as high as 2 mg (2000 mcg) of nitroglycerin have been given safely and effectively in previous studies. In emergent resuscitations we need to focus on bolus dose medications in the acute phase versus starting and titrating critical care infusions while a patient is in extremis. The goal is to achieve clinical end points of treatment faster with bolus dosing at the bedside and then begin maintenance infusions once resuscitation goals are met and the hemodynamics are stable.

Especially that day in the boat as we scoured the shoreline on the Greek island of Kos looking for some sign, anything, of his missing son. I still cannot begin to imagine what Ali Chadan went through, and most likely is still going through. What must it be like to watch your child slip away from your grasp in the ocean never to be seen again? What goes through your head when a short time later another of your children dies from heart failure before your eyes on a beach? Having survived a war during which Ali lost his wife and lived under the rule of terror wrought by the Islamic State (IS) group, all this man wanted, he told me, was to make his children safe. Loading article content Instead he found himself along with his youngsters and 40 other refugees from Syria and Iraq alone at night in the freezing waters of the Aegean Sea after the rubber boat into which they had been crammed foundered in the waves. The last I saw of Ali Chadan was in a cafe in Kos town. It was the day after we had searched the coastline in vain for his son?s body, and he and his two surviving children were waiting to be fed by local volunteers who had come together to help refugees like them. The closure Ali so sorely wanted by finding a trace of his missing son had eluded him. Now he and his remaining family faced the long, unpredictable and arduous journey to Switzerland where he hoped to stay with relatives who lived there. I thought of Ali and his children again last Monday after MPs voted against welcoming just 600 child refugees a year over the next half decade. Had the cross-party amendment to the immigration bill, tabled in the House of Lords, gone through, it would have seen the UK accept 3,000 unaccompanied Syrian refugee children from inside the EU. This in itself is a tiny number but proved too much for ""Great"" Britain to muster the humanity needed to make these children safe. To say I felt a profound sense of shame in the result of that vote would be an understatement. It was a shame only subsequently matched by an anger and frustration at the moral bankruptcy of a UK government that once again showed its true and callous colours. If ever there was any doubt as to the political hue of the UK in which we now live that Commons vote made it plain to see. Here once again thrown in our face like a soiled rag was another flagrant display of the inhumanity the rich and secure inflict on the destitute and powerless. That the government?s arguments against the bill were at best spurious and at times downright bogus only added to the sickening sense of ""I?m all right Jack"". In arguing its case the government says taking more children would only create a ""pull factor"" encouraging others to send their children to Europe. Frankly, the government?s promulgation of the idea that somewhere in the ruins of cities like Aleppo or Homs, Syrian families sit conspiratorially planning to work the system to their advantage is nothing short of insulting. If nothing else, too, it is but an extension of the thinking that prevails here at home among those Tories who see scroungers and chancers everywhere except among their own ranks of tax avoiders. The Tory government?s take is but another symptom of the self-centredness that has become the hallmark of the country in which we now live. As long as my offshore investment fund is fine, who gives a damn about those foundering in the Aegean, is the rallying cry of Tory austerity, pull-up-the-ladder behind you Britain. As Lord Alfred Dubs, who tabled the amendment to the bill last week, pointed out, this current Tory government would ?have probably said no? to taking in children fleeing the Nazis as the world lurched towards war in the 1930?s. As he rightly said too the government of David Cameron is ?hung up, obsessed? with opposing bringing children from Europe. Lord Dubs should know given he himself came to Britain on the Kindertransport for Jewish children fleeing Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia after the government here at the time agreed to go ahead with the rescue scheme. But that was back then. Today one can?t help wondering whatever became of that Britain, the one ready and willing to step up to the plate as it did in the 1930s in a spirit of basic humanity. This was a place where British merchant seamen risked their lives to take cargo ships through a blockade into the beleaguered Basque port city of Bilbao. Their mission was to rescue refugees fleeing General Franco?s fascist onslaught of Guernica and other towns during the Spanish Civil War. These days the British government is more ready to send warships to prevent refugees crossing the Aegean after fleeing conflict rather than deploy those same vessels in any humanitarian capacity. Just like Ali Chadan?s children, thousands of others have already lost their lives trying to do no more than strive for even a sliver of the security and comfort we all demand and take for granted. If reaction on social media was anything to go by the nation seemed collectively appalled at the 289 Conservative MPs who voted against the amendment to the bill that would help these refugee children. Perhaps after a time some politicians can sleep easy at night after making decisions like this that effectively ensured thousands of vulnerable children who have already undergone all manner of horrors, would continue to sleep rough or in fear in makeshift camps across Europe. Maybe those same politicians take succour from the fact that at least we know where those children are, unlike the 10,000 other refugee children Europol, the police agency says are unaccounted for. Where are these children, these ghosts of government cynicism, indifference and outrageous abdication of responsibility?",

A few years ago I was in hospital for influenza that hit me so hard I was leaking troponin the heart attack enzyme. They sent me home telling me I had severe asthma and gave me a preventer turbohaler and ventoloin. I was at my gp a couple of weeks back and I was having trouble breathing. He used the spirometer then ventolin and back on the spirometer. He does not believe I have asthma . He thinks I have copd and wanted to start me on Spiriva. I waited till I saw my nephrologist. My kidneys are good, cyclosporine is keeping the nephrotic syndrome in check. I told him I made a list of my serious chronic conditions. There were 17 of them. He said you don't believe the copd do you? I said no so he asked why not. I said my uncle died of copd , my mother and brother were both asthmatics and my dad had bronchitis, they all coughed there guts up all the time . I have no cough. I told him I had bad oedema in the legs. He checked and was quite rattled to find it was up past my knees. He checked my lungs and they too had fluid in them. He listened to my heart and said there was a murmur that sounded like a leaky valve. So I have peripheral oedema. pulmonary oedema ,possible pulmonary hypertension and a faulty heart valve all of which adds up to congestive heart failure.

I am not sure whether he s trying to help me or kill me. The moral of the story is that most doctors don't really consider the means as long as they achieve the end. And sometimes I think the end is just to achieve a little more life with no concern for the quality of that life.

Sometimes this is a wrong move since the pains are an indicator of a more complex medical condition. A painful irritation in itself is not a sickness, but the resultant effect is sometimes a disease. A visit to a pain doctor Houston professional is the ultimate step that you should take to verify whether your discomfort is indicative. This article expounds on some of the pains that are indicative. One of the pains that you should not overlook is severe morning headache. A mild headache can go unnoticed, but a severe headache denotes an acute health issue such as a brain tumor. The condition is rare. Therefore, you should not think of a brain tumor every time your head hurts in the morning. The incidence of a primary brain tumor is usually below one percent. At times, you may experience a stomach irritation that occurs between the navel and the breastplate. It is usually in the form of a burning sensation, and it indicates several medical conditions including ulcers. This type of pain has other complimentary signs such as blood in the stool and getting a relief each time you take a meal. A swelling or discomfort in one leg calls for a doctor assessment since it denotes a blood clot. Notably, swelling in both legs is a sign of a congestive heart failure. Long trips on planes or cars, and long rests and recent surgeries are some of the factors that cause blood clots. If you have a family history of cancer and fever, then you should see an expert when you experience a severe back discomfort that wakes you up from a deep sleep at night. Sometimes the wear and tear of the body causes such a back irritation, but you should visit an expert to verify the main cause of the irritation. Additionally, having a penetrative back discomfort indicates that you could be having hardening arteries. Therefore, you should visit a specialist for a checkup. Pins and needles that occur in the feet call for a visit to a doctor. Numbness usually precedes the feeling, and you should see a doctor as soon as possible. According to doctors, the feeling is an early sign of diabetes, and if you experience such a feeling, you should get tested for diabetes. Apparently, most people ignore the feeling and they live with diabetes that is not diagnosed for a long time. It is only a specialist who can candidly confirm whether the irritation that you have is indicative or not. Instead of assuming the discomfort or getting painkillers for the same, you should visit an expert. You might end up using the wrong medication which could cause complications later.

Some individuals may be able to balance their liquid intake versus their output at night. However, many benefit more fully from natural support such as grapefruit juice and rice vinegar. What is Nocturia? Defined as a condition in which an individual must wake throughout the night to urinate, nocturia is a condition that affects both men and women and is more common with age. Symptoms of the condition include the need to rise from sleeping more than once throughout the night as well as disruptions in the normal sleep cycle. Nocturia has several different causes including high fluid intake, untreated diabetes, congestive heart failure, sleeping disorders, certain medications, bladder obstruction, bladder infection and several others. Natural Remedies for Nocturnal Urination Treating nocturnal urination hinges on relieving pressure on the urinary system. While some individuals are able to balance this independently, others benefit from support. Grapefruit juice and rice vinegar are two effective natural options for treating nocturia. Grapefruit Juice Grapefruit functions as a powerful antioxidant. The fruit and the natural juice contain an enzyme that detoxes the blood and circulatory system and relieves symptoms of nocturia. The fruit also delivers important nutrients to the body supporting general health at the same time. Rice Vinegar Rice vinegar offers a number of healthful benefits that also help treat nocturnal urination. Vinegar is a powerful antiseptic, so it cleanses the system of any bacteria that may be contributing to the condition. Also, the compound contains nearly 20 amino acids which support cell function and regulation as well as general circulatory health. Caused by a number of different factors, nocturia is characterized by the inability to sleep through the night without the need to wake to urinate more than once. Regulating fluids, treating underlying conditions and using natural supports effectively help treat the condition, however. The top remedy for this condition: Grapefruit Juice (3 )",

The soldiers were hit while on duty at a post on the glacier at an altitude of 19,000 feet, Colonel S.D. Goswami said. ?In the early hours of today, 10 soldiers were hit by an avalanche on the northern Siachen Glacier,? he said. An army statement said the post was being manned by a junior officer and nine soldiers when the avalanche struck. ?Rescue operations by specialised teams from army and air force are underway to rescue the soldiers. The rescue operations are being closely monitored from Leh and Udhampur,? the statement added. The Siachen Glacier has been dubbed the world?s highest battlefield. Avalanches and landslides are common in the area during the winter and temperatures there can drop as low as minus 60 degrees Celsius. In January four soldiers were killed by an avalanche, while last year another four died when their vehicle was buried under an avalanche near Leh, the main city in the high-altitude region known as Ladakh. An estimated 8,000 troops have died on the glacier since 1984, almost all of them from avalanches, landslides, frostbite, altitude sickness or heart failure rather than combat.

No Comments Scientists have used a novel gene therapy to halt the progression of pulmonary hypertension, a form of high blood pressure in the lung blood vessels that is linked to heart failure, according to a study led by Roger J. Hajjar, MD, Professor of Medicine and Director of the Cardiovascular Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The study was published online this week, and will appear in the May 3 issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC). Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, rapidly progressing disease that occurs when blood pressure is too high in vessels leading from the heart to the lungs. There is currently no cure for PAH, and about 50 percent of people who are diagnosed will die from the disease within five years. The high pressure is caused by abnormal remodeling of the lung blood vessels that sometimes leads to failure of the right ventricle and premature death. Thickening and narrowing of pulmonary vessels is seen with all types of pulmonary hypertension and is triggered by abnormal calcium levels within the vascular cells. The sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump (SERCA2a) regulates intracellular calcium in vascular cells and prevents them from proliferating in the vessel wall. ""There is considerable need for new treatments that improve functional capacity, symptoms, and survival,"" said Dr. Hajjar. ""This treatment with gene therapy offers a novel method of treating a deadly disease that disproportionately affects young adults and women,"" he said. Female patients make up about 72 percent of the total population of patients with PAH. ""The therapeutic potential of using gene therapy to treat pulmonary hypertension by delivery of aerosolized adeno-associated virus carrying SERCA2a to directly target vascular remodeling through the overexpression of the SERCA2a protein is very significant,"" said co-senior study author Jane A. Leopold, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. ""In addition, as other novel targets are identified by deep phenotyping of patients with pulmonary hypertension in the National Institutes of Health/National, Heart, Lung, & Blood Institute-funded Pulmonary Vascular Disease Phenomics (PVDOMICS) study, they may be viable candidates for aerosolized gene transfer using adeno-associated viral vectors.""

Curr Med Res Opin. 2016 Jun 27;:1-32 Authors: Swindle JP, Chan W, Waltman Johnson K, Becker L, Blauer-Peterson C, Altan A Abstract OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of patient/clinical characteristics with mortality and readmission following a heart failure (HF)-related hospitalization. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Claims data, linked to laboratory, race/ethnicity, and mortality data, from a large United States health plan were utilized to identify individuals with ?1 inpatient claim with a diagnosis code for HF (1/1/2008-9/30/2012). Study variables were analyzed using descriptive and multivariable approaches to identify patient/clinical characteristics associated with post-discharge outcomes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included post-discharge mortality and readmission. RESULTS: 126,214 individuals were identified with a HF-related hospitalization; 19.1% with data to calculate chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage. For the overall sample, mortality probability was 4.9% and 13.4% at 1 and 6 months post-discharge, respectively (4.5% and 12.4% for subset with calculated CKD stage), while readmission (all-cause) probability was 14.8% and 39.6% at 1 and 6 months post-discharge, respectively (18.4% and 44.5% for subset with calculated CKD stage). Within the subset with calculated CKD stage, mortality and readmission probabilities differed by CKD stage (p?<?0.001), with decreased renal function corresponding with increased risk of mortality and readmission. After multivariable adjustment, increasing age was associated with increased risk of mortality, while advancing CKD stage, various index hospitalization variables (i.e., pre-admission emergency room visit, intensive care unit during hospitalization), and baseline all-cause hospitalization were associated with both increased risk of mortality and all-cause 1-month readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Calculated CKD, various index hospitalization variables, and baseline all-cause hospitalization were associated with increased risk of mortality and all-cause 1-month readmission among patients hospitalized with HF. Risk of post-discharge readmission and mortality increased with worse renal function, suggesting improved management of this subset may reduce the burden and cost of this disease. Key study limitations include those related to retrospective claims-based studies and that renal function data were available for a subset of study patients.

I've recently heard a lot about interval training. What is it exactly, and is it safe for everyone? How do I get started? To improve the fitness of your heart and lungs - known as cardiorespiratory fitness - you need to exercise at a higher level of intensity than is typical for you. High-intensity aerobic interval training, also called HIIT, involves alternating periods of moderate-intensity exercise with brief periods of high-intensity exercise. Incorporating HIIT into your exercise routine can be a safe and effective way to help your body adapt to a more intense workout and become more fit. There are many benefits of HIIT, compared to moderate-intensity exercise. For example, HIIT offers a more rapid and greater increase in cardiovascular fitness. It's also a time-saver. The duration of exercise sessions may be shortened, since HIIT exercisers expend the same or even greater number of calories per session. In addition, people often find HIIT more interesting and engaging than moderate-intensity exercise. To use HIIT, you need to be able to tell the difference between moderate-intensity exercise and high-intensity exercise. An easy way to distinguish between the two is with the talk test. During moderate-intensity exercise, you can talk, but you cannot sing. During high-intensity exercise, you can only say a few words before you need to take a breath. At high-intensity, you feel physically challenged, and you can only exercise for a limited time before you need to lower your exercise intensity. Before you begin HIIT, exercise at moderate intensity only for several workout sessions until you can exercise continuously at that level for at least 20 minutes. You can use whatever form of aerobic exercise you prefer. Walking, jogging, biking or working out on an exercise machine, such as an elliptical trainer, are all good choices. The first time you use HIIT, warm up for five minutes at a relatively easy pace. Then move to a moderate pace for about five to 10 minutes. After that, switch to a high-intensity pace for 30 seconds, then reduce your pace to back moderate for one to three minutes to allow yourself to recover completely. Repeat the high-intensity pace and moderate-intensity recovery phases two or three times during a 30-minute exercise session. When you are exercising at the higher intensity, you should be pushing yourself, but you don't need to be working at your maximum effort. During your exercise session, you should not experience symptoms such as chest pain or discomfort, severe shortness of breath or lightheadedness. If you do, stop exercising right away. You also should not have unusual fatigue, muscle pain or joint pain that lasts a long time after you exercise. Talk to your health care provider about any of these symptoms or about other symptoms you have during exercise that seem out of the ordinary. As you become accustomed to HIIT and your fitness improves, increase the number of times you switch between high-intensity and moderate-intensity to five or six per workout. You also can increase the amount of time you stay at the high-intensity pace to one to two minutes as you are able. Even as you become more fit, include HIIT in only two or three of your exercise sessions per week. Those sessions should not be on consecutive days. HIIT can be used effectively by athletes, as well as people of all ages and fitness levels, including people with serious diseases, such as coronary heart disease and chronic heart failure. Talk with your health care provider before you start HIIT, especially if you have a chronic illness, such as heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney disease, stroke or arthritis. --- (Mayo Clinic News Network is your source for health news, advances in research and wellness tips.)

About 3 weeks pfc last January both gamma scan and US showed the same EF, and I started the every-three-weeks Herceptin shots. A control gamma scan the end of March showed the same EF --- which measures systolic function --- so I continued on Herceptin. However I got the full gamma scan results a week ago, and they show a definite drop in diastolic heart function to below normal. This is apparently an early sign of the kind of heart failure caused by chemo. The cancer doc had said my heart was still fine. So yes Herceptin is hurting my heart, although some of this could be a delayed effect of CEF chemo.

Years of working long hours may help you climb the career ladder, but those hours may take a steep toll on your health ? and that?s especially true for women, new research says. ?People who habitually put in a lot of long hours for many years, even decades, are really running an increased risk of potentially seeing chronic disease later in life,? said study researcher Allard Dembe. He?s a professor of health services management and policy at the College of Public Health at Ohio State University. The link between long work hours and disease ?seems to be present a bit in men but is tremendously more evident in women,? said Dembe. While the study cannot prove cause and effect, he said, the associations were strong in women. When the researchers compared men who worked more than 60 hours a week to those who worked 30 to 40, they found those who worked the longer hours had more than twice the risk of getting osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. But men?s risk for other chronic or serious diseases didn?t go up substantially. In fact, those who worked 41 to 50 hours had a lower risk of heart disease, lung disease and depression, researchers noted. But when the study compared women who worked 30 to 40 hours a week to those who worked more than 60 hours a week, women who worked more had substantially higher rates of disease. Women who worked 60 or more hours had more than three times the risk of heart disease, non-skin cancer and diabetes, nearly three times the risk of asthma, and nearly four times the risk of arthritis, the study showed. The risks for women began to climb when they worked more than 40 hours and escalated above 50 hours. The gender differences were surprising, Dembe said, as was the strength of the increased risks he found for women. The study included information on the working habits of nearly 7,500 U.S. men and women over more than three decades. Most of the study volunteers were over 50 toward the end of the study. The researchers then looked to see if there was any link between work hours and the diagnosis of eight different diseases. These included heart disease, non-skin cancer, arthritis, diabetes, chronic lung disease, asthma, depression and high blood pressure, the study said. Twenty-eight percent of those in the study worked 30 to 40 hours weekly. Most people ? 56 percent ? in the study worked 41 to 50 hours a week, the study said. Thirteen percent put in 51 to 60 hours weekly, while 3 percent toiled for 60 hours or more a week, the study found. Dembe could not explain why more work hours seemed to have such an impact on women?s health, but believes that women?s multiple roles are at the root. ?My speculation is, they have to balance all these other roles, parenting, child care, domestic responsibilities, worrying about everyone?s health care,? he said. Working the long hours can interfere with sleep and keep the body in a constant state of stress, Dembe said. The study findings make sense, said cardiologist Dr. Nieca Goldberg. She?s medical director of the Joan H. Tisch Center for Women?s Health at New York University Langone Medical Center, in New York City. ?These women [who log long work weeks] are not taking care of themselves,? Goldberg speculated. ?Maybe they are not going to screening tests [such as mammograms].? Working long hours and taking care of a family may leave little time to prepare meals, she said, so these women may be eating and serving their family fast food or other takeout that is unhealthy. Women working long hours who are single mothers may have even more responsibilities and stress, she said. So, what can women do to protect their health? ?Obviously, people need to work and pay their rent,? Goldberg said. However, she tells women who work long hours to step back and take stock. Is there something they can cut out? Perhaps doing less volunteer work until the work load on the job declines? Goldberg said taking some time for yourself every day is crucial. That could mean getting some exercise, reading a book, watching TV or even just sitting doing deep breathing. ?Clear your head,? she said. The study was published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine. More information To learn more about women and heart disease, visit SecondsCount.org.",

The stethoscope is one of the greatest symbols of medicine and for almost 200 years it has been perhaps the most valuable tool in helping doctors diagnose everything from pneumonia to heart failure, but the stethoscope is under attack these days with some saying it is an obsolete low-tech vestige of an antiquated era. Technology enthusiasts argue that the stethoscope should be replaced by portable ultrasound devices. It sounds cruel but they are saying that the stethoscope?s 200th birthday should also be its funeral. Those who argue in favor of ultrasound say there is evidence that ultrasound is more accurate even than chest x-ray in the detection of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and perhaps even pneumonia. In an editorial in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, the physician author said that there are definitely great things that the ultrasound provides but we cannot teach our medical students to become reliant upon advanced technologies without which they become useless.",

I was born with TOF (Tetralogy of Fallots). Unfortunately I was one of the old generation to have this so I've had further complications. I had my original repair in 1982 then in 1992 I had my first pulmonary valve replacement, then I went on to have my second pulmonary valve replacement in 2013, a pulmonary artery repair and I also had a tricuspid valve repair done which wasn't successful for me. After my heart surgery I got afib. I was offered the ablation, but after going over it with the consultants we decided the risks for me outwayed the benefits. Plus it would only give me 6 months free from it if it worked, which wasn't likely. I have pacing wires in ready for that to happen in the future and I have aortic, pulmonary and tricuspid valve leaking. I've been told I'm in heart failure and to live my life now as they can only pro long it for me. I recently lost my disibilty car and can't get to my gp. (I live very rural). I'm on warfarin, bisoprolol, ramipril, digoxin, butamide and spironolactone. Over the last week my heart rhythm has been all over the place, especially at night time. (I'm getting no sleep at all). My heart is aching to the point I'm feeling so tired with it. I really am at breaking point and need to cry. Does anyone else's ache so badly? My next appointment with my cardiac team was October, I rang last week and now have one the middle of July as my symptoms have gone horrendous lately. I get dizzy, light headed (to the point of fainting), odemea, breathlessness, tiredness, muscle weakness, plus more.... If anyone else has this aching feeling I would love to hear from you. I really don't like ringing my cardiac nurse unnecessarily.",
